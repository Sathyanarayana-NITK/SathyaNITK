the main drivers of growth were 
in t elecoms & m2m and t errestrial 
broadcast, with revenues up 18.5%
1 
and 6.3% respectively.the group has contracted with the 
major broadcasters and ofcom 
for the delivery of the programme.the trial was also 
noted in the march 2017 government 
document above as an example of a 
project to help build the case for 5g 
networks.following the excellent delivery and 
results achieved to date, thames water 
have taken the decision to accelerate the 
smart metering network deployment.the increase in revenue resulted 
primarily from growth across the group’s 
core telecoms towers business driven 
by increased site numbers under the 
group’s control and associated activities, 
accelerations to installation services 
activity to assist mnos in meeting 
coverage requirements, and the m2m 
business.the group extended the 
maturity of its facilities by establishing the 
following: 
 	 a £218.5m amortising, sterling 
denominated, floating rate, us private 
placement with a final maturity of 
december 2029; 
 	 a £255m amortising term bank facility 
with an expected maturity of june 
2020 and a legal final maturity of 
december 2024 (of which £100.0m 
principal was repaid in the current 
year);
 	 a £250m bank facility for capital 
expenditure purposes having an 
expected maturity of march 2021
(undrawn at june 2017); 
 	 a £140m bank facility for working 
capital purposes having an expected 
maturity of march 2021 (£86.0m 
drawn as at june 2017); and
 	 a £250m liquidity facility, which 
matures in 2041, that replaces the 
existing liquidity facility and which is a 
typical requirement for securitisation 
structures (undrawn as at june 2017).the report states that to deliver the high 
speed, high capacity capabilities of 5g 
will likely require the deployment of a 
significant number of small cells.annual report for the year ended 30 june 2017

independent auditors’ report to the members 
of arqiva group limited  
 
report on the audit of 
the financial statements 
opinion 
in our opinion: 
 arqiva group limited’s group 
financial statements and 
company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”) 
give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the 
company’s affairs as at 30 
june 2017 and of the group’s 
loss and cash flows for the 
year then ended; 
 the group financial statements 
have been properly prepared 
in accordance with ifrss as 
adopted by the european 
union; 
 the company financial 
statements have been 
properly prepared in 
accordance with united 
kingdom generally accepted 
accounting practice (united 
kingdom accounting 
standards, comprising frs 101 
“reduced disclosure 
framework”, and applicable 
law); and 
 the financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
companies act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial 
statements, article 4 of the ias 
regulation.there are multiple elements 
involved and a degree of management judgement in 
determining what is included in the total contract 
position to completion and the margin to be 
recognised.reporting on other 
information  
the other information comprises 
all of the information in the 
annual report and consolidated 
financial statements other than 
the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon.auditors’ responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial 
statements 
our objectives are to obtain 
reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion.the financial statements have 
been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the valuation 
of financial instruments that are 
measured at fair values at the end 
of each reporting period, as 
explained in the accounting 
policies below.the total 
contract consideration is allocated 
between the separate elements on 
the basis of relative fair value and 
the appropriate revenue 
recognition criteria are applied to 
each element.the amount initially recognised 
for internally-generated intangible 
assets is the sum of the 
expenditure incurred from the 
date when the intangible asset 
first meets the recognition criteria 
listed above.gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of an intangible asset, 
measured as the difference 
between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset, are recognised in 
profit or loss when the asset is 
derecognised.the 
cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and 
direct labour.exceptions to this 
principle have been made for 
leasing transactions that are 
within the scope of ias 17, and 
measurements that are 
approximations to fair value but 
are not fair value, such as value in 
use in ias 36.  
in addition, for financial reporting 
purposes, fair value 
measurements are categorised 
into level 1, 2 or 3 based on the 
degree to which the inputs to the 
fair value measurements are 
observable and the significance of 
the inputs to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety, which 
are described as follows:  
 level 1 inputs are quoted 
prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets 
or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the 
measurement date; 
 level 2 inputs are inputs, 
other than quoted prices 
included within level 1, that 
are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly or 
indirectly; and 
 level 3 inputs are 
unobservable inputs for the 
asset or liability.revenue recognition (critical 
accounting judgement and key 
source of estimation uncertainty) 
in applying the group’s revenue 
recognition policy, as set out in 
note 3, judgements are made in 
respect of certain areas including: 
 determination of distinct 
contract components and 
performance obligations; 
 measurement of variable 
consideration; 
 determination of fair value of 
non-cash consideration; and 
 the recognition of a 
significant financing 
component.the most significant 
criteria considered for the 
selection of bonds include the 
issue size of the corporate bonds, 
quality of the bonds and the 
identification of outliers which are  annual report and consolidated financial statements 2017
