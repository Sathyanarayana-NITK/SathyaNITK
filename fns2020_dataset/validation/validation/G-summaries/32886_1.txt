as importantly, it 
shares many similarities with egypt’s market in the 1980s 
and 1990s in terms of structure, pace of development, and 
the emerging disease profile of patients.•	 most labs in egypt are concentrated in big cities; there 
is still substantial room to increase accessibility to lab 
services by adding branches in all of the country’s 29 
governorates for greater coverage of the population.idh annual report 2017 34 principal risks,

the group is subject to the economic conditions of egypt 
specifically and, to a lesser extent, those of the wider 
mena region.due to the 
volumes of kits the company purchases, idh is able to ne-
gotiate favourable pricing that in 2016 saw the price it pays 
for kits rise slower than inflation, which rose to new highs 
as a result of the devaluation of the egp .the group’s general counsel and the quality assurance team 
work together to keep idh abreast of, and in compliance 
with, both legislative and regulatory changes.the loss of the services of key members of that 
team could materially and adversely affect the company’s 
operations and business.the failure to renew 
these certifications, including the college of american 
pathologists (cap) accreditation for the mega lab or the 
international organization for standards (ios) for other fa-
cilities, would call into question the group’s quality stand-
ards and competitive differentiators.idh annual report 2017  39 strategic report

idh delivered strong operational and financial results in 
the year ended 31 december 2017, despite macroeconomic 
challenges, in particular high inflation, that continued in 
the aftermath of the november 2016 floatation of the egyp-
tian pound.if the minimum annual 
commitment payments are met over the agreement pe-
riod, ownership of the equipment supplied will legally 
transfer to idh.the board has invested significant time discussing and 
evaluating the group’s strategy and prospects for future 
growth, the outcome of which is presented in our state-
ment of strategy on page 32. we are confident that we have 
in place the right strategy and the right management team 
to deliver shareholder returns going forward.the group’s general counsel also 
attends these meetings on an as-needed basis.senior man-
agement uses this as a forum to review upcoming priorities, 
recent performance, and the operational steps necessary to 
ensure the management team delivers on its business goals 
and the group’s strategic plan.the nomination committee met on 21 august 
2017 within the context of the regular board of directors 
meeting, where it was resolved to appoint mr. omar bedewy 
as chief financial officer in succession to mr. t arek hamida.the board has accordingly established that the group

•	 the identification and management of risk at the 
level of operating departments by the heads of 
those departments; and

ness risks of the group, together with measures

statement of compliance
the consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the european union (adopted ifrs) issued by the international accounting 
standards board (iasb) and the jersey law 1991 an amendment to which means separate company financial statements 
are not required.the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is esti-
mated by discounting the future contracted cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the group for 
similar transactions.any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at 
the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.the eir amortisation is included in finance 
income in the statement of profit or loss.the losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables.when it has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the group continues 
to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the origi-
nal carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the group could be required to repay.impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in expense categories consistent with 
the function of the impaired asset, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation taken to other comprehensive 
income (“oci”).idh annual re por t 2017 86 if such indication exists, the group estimates the asset’s or cgu’s recoverable amount.this standard replaces ias 39 and sets 
out two key criteria for determining the classification and measurement of financial assets including the entity’s business 
model for managing financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics.based on the sensitivity analysis, a 1% change in the wacc would result in a 5-7% change in the valuation of the cgu.the analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of pension and other post-
retirement obligations; provisions; and the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.the following assump-
tions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
•	 the sensitivity of the relevant statement of profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market 
risks.the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the us dollar, sudanese pound and the jordanian dinar.
