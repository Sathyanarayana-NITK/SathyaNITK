key performance indicators (kpis)
work is under way led by david smith, our 
newly appointed chief financial officer, to 
review the key performance indicators and 
other metrics that we use to monitor the 
performance of the company and measure 
the progress of the implementation of our 
strategy.rationale
this shows the overall financial performance 
of the group reflecting both underlying  
and specific adjusting items of income and 
expenditure.the period over which we confirm longer-term viability
while the directors have no reason to believe the group 
will not be viable over a longer period than three years, 
given the inherent uncertainty involved, the period over 
which the directors consider it possible to form a 
reasonable expectation as to the group’s longer-term 
viability is the three-year period to 31 march 2020. this 
period, essentially the period used for our mid-term 
business plans that are subject to stress-testing and 
scenario planning, has been selected because it 
presents the board and readers of the annual report 
with a reasonable degree of confidence whilst still 
providing an appropriate longer-term outlook.commenting 
on the day, a graduate said: 
“throughout the workshop 
as you understand more 
about consumption, the easier 
it becomes to think of ideas 
that may seem small but could 
have the potential to have a 
big impact on our usage.”

risk reporting is 
embedded in the 
management of the 
business through the 
executive committee 
and monthly business 
performance reviews 
and feeds into group 
strategy at the 
executive and 
board level.the market conditions in which the 
group operates have been, and are expected to continue 
to be, challenging as spending from the group’s key 
customers in its primary markets in the uk and us 
remains under pressure.as noted on page 50, following on from the board 
effectiveness review, the format for the group risk 
register and for risk reporting was reviewed by the 
board at its september and march meetings respectively.in summary the new policy:

the auditor is required to report on the information in this table.the holders 
of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the company’s 
reports and accounts, to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the company, to exercise voting rights in 
person or by appointing a proxy, and to receive 
a dividend where declared or paid out of profits 
available for that purpose.directors’ interests in contracts
at the date of this report, there is no contract or 
arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries 
that is significant in relation to the business of the group 
as a whole in which a director of the company is 
materially interested.5. we have nothing to report on the disclosures 
of principal risks
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to: 
 – the directors’ confirmation of longer-term viability 
on page 22, concerning the principal risks, their 
management, and, based on that, the directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 
31 march 2020; or 
 – the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting.however, having considered the terms of the proxy agreement, the 
directors consider that the group meets the requirements of ifrs 10 in respect of control over such affected entities and, therefore, consolidates these entities 
in the consolidated accounts.the fair value of unquoted equity investments is based on the price 
of the most recent investment by the group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows.in these cases, the costs incurred after 
announcement of the group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress.under the cumulative method, qinetiq would apply the new
