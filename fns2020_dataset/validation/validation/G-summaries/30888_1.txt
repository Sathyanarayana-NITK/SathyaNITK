developing stakeholder communication
the board will focus on the continued development of a clear 
narrative for communicating progress against the group's 
strategy to the investor community.the key responsibilities of the committee are:
 › reviewing the size, structure and composition of the board;
 › recommending membership of board committees;
 › undertaking succession planning for the chairman, chief 
executive and other directors and senior management;
 › searching for candidates for the board, and recommending 
directors for appointment;
 › determining the independence of directors;
during the year the committee focused 
heavily on the search for a new chairman 
and i would like to thank russell king  
for leading this process on behalf of  
the board.the committee members were unanimous in their final 
selection of the new chairman and on 17 may 2017, we were 
pleased to announce the appointment of mark williamson as 
non-executive chairman with effect from the conclusion of 
the spectris annual general meeting held on 26 may 2017. 
mark was a strong match to our requirements with 
considerable business and financial expertise combined with 
broad governance experience.the committee considers it important to interact with members of 
management beyond the executive committee.as a committee, we will continue to focus on risk management 
and, in particular, the group’s ongoing enhancements to systems 
of governance and internal control during 2018.
i hope that you find this review, and the report that follows, useful 
in understanding the work of the committee during the year.all members 
of the committee are considered to have competencies that  
the board deems relevant to the sectors in which the  
company operates.the purpose of the internal audit function is to provide 
independent, objective assurance to add value and improve the 
group’s operations.they should satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial 
information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are 
robust and defensible.on appointment, and as at the date of this report, the chairman’s significant 
listed company interests are as chairman of imperial brands plc and senior 
independent non-executive director of national grid plc.the 
board considers that executive director remuneration is an appropriate balance 
between fixed and performance-related, immediate and deferred remuneration, 
with the latter being subject to demanding performance conditions aligned with 
the group’s strategic objectives, including appropriate circumstances for spectris 
to recover sums paid or to withhold payment of sums.directors
