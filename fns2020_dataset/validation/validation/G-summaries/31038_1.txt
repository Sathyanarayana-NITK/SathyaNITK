amortisation and acquisition costs 
increased significantly during the period, as the group continued to 
accelerate its growth through the acquisition element of its strategy.the company conducts extensive checks on the suitability of its 
prospective franchisees but it cannot be entirely certain that a 
franchisee does not have some potentially embarrassing adverse 
history which may come to light and which risks damaging the 
reputation of the brand.the performance of the directors is evaluated on an 
ongoing basis.the financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
international financial reporting standards (ifrss) as adopted by 
the european union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
companies act 2006.
in our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 december 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year  
then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european 
union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
companies act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the companies act 2006.

- management judgement is required in assessing 
whether the acquisition constitutes the acquisition of a 
business, in which case ifrs 3 ‘business combinations’ 
applies or simply the acquisition of intangible assets, in 
which case ias 38 would apply.we reviewed and challenged management’s calculation of the fair value of

the notes on pages 39 to 67 form part of these financial statements.the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments at fair value.where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial information of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the group.revenue is 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be measured reliably.no amounts are deferred as the directors are of the opinion that 
virtually all inception costs are incurred at the outset, and hence although contracts run for several years this policy is considered to be the 
fairest presentation to comply with the matching and accruals concepts.revenue from franchisee management service fees are recognised monthly in arrears, calculated by reference to the terms of the contract 
and the value of sales attributable to each franchisee.financial services revenue is recognised at the later of the policy inception date or confirmation of entitlement to the commission.amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the 
following bases:
software    3–7 years or over the life of the license 
franchise development costs  over the life of the franchise contract (typically 10–15 years) 
brands    10 years 
customer lists   2–15 years
1.7 property, plant and equipment 
property, plant and equipment are recognised as an asset only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.strategic report overview governance financial statements

provisions of the instrument.the cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.disclosures have been extended in the current reporting period to reflect the updated requirements of ias 7 ‘statement of cash flows’.all other amendments, including the adoption of ifrs 15, are not expected to have a material impact on the group’s financial statements.franchisee revenue & intangible assets
franchisee sign up fees are recognised upfront at the inception of a franchisee contract, which in the directors’ opinion matches to the 
estimated cost of time and knowledge to create the franchiser-franchisee contractual arrangement.the chief operating decision maker of the group is considered to be the board  
of directors.due to the specific nature of the group’s market, each 
component of revenue naturally falls within one of these segments.segmental analysis of revenue
