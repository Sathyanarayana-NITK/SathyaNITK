our people and culture
we could do none of this without the 
passionate, committed and talented people 
at asos all working towards our goals and 
purpose.fit out commences 
shortly and the facility is expected to be 
operational by autumn 2018.
technology
during the year, asos significantly 
ramped up the pace of both technology 
investment and implementation.additionally asos will complete 
the implementation of a number of 
transformational technology programmes 
including the new retail and planning 
system tgr along with the finance and 
people systems.that depends on us setting 
appropriate product quality and 
ethical trading standards, and our 
suppliers meeting and adhering to 
those standards – something which 
becomes more crucial the bigger 
our brand gets and the greater our 
customers’ expectations become 
in relation to the integrity of the 
brands they engage with.our achievements this year include:
—  the graduation of 70 asos retail 
and marketing employees from the 
sustainable leaders at asos training 
programme in collaboration with the 
sustainable fashion academy
—  making accelerated progress towards 
our 2020 goal of 95% more sustainable 
cotton in our collections – with 44% 
verified sustainable cotton sourced by 
june against our 2017 target of 70% 
—  launching our wood and wood pulp 
policy and working with suppliers to 
ensure wood, paper and cellulosic fibres 
in our own-buy products and our office 
isn’t from ancient or endangered forests 
—  joining the sustainable apparel 
coalition (sac) and completing our 
“ this year, we’ve recognised that our priority 
must be to close the loop and engage in a 
circular economy, prioritising recycling and 
design for re-use.overall, 
emissions have increased by 329% 
compared to the previous year, primarily 
due to improvements in data quality and an 
expansion of our reporting scope.we do 
most of our work in the uk, particularly 
in the four areas where we employ the 
most people: london, hemel hempstead/
leavesden, barnsley and birmingham.governance highlights over the year
we previously identified a need for a 
dedicated business assurance function 
to increase the effectiveness of our risk 
management and compliance.however, in recognition of best practice, 
we go beyond these rules to meet the 
provisions of the uk corporate governance 
code in a number of areas.the minutes of committee meetings are circulated to all committee members and 
are given by each relevant committee chairman to the board.we agreed 
to invest in further automation and facilities 
improvements in our barnsley warehouse, 
the opening and then phase 2 extension 
of our new eurohub 2 fulfilment centre, 
the start of a new project to open a us 
fulfilment centre near atlanta, georgia 
during the next financial year, and the 
further development of our head office in 
camden, london.—  appropriate oversight: as businesses 
change, so do their challenges and risks.—  appropriate engagement: recognising 
that, where standards and policies 
apply across asos, they are only 
effective if their intended audiences fully 
engage with them, and that asos has 
a non-traditional but effective culture, 
we dedicate a lot of time and effort to 
ensure that all asos-wide standards 
and policies in all areas (including 
business integrity, anti-bribery, gifts 
and hospitality, intellectual property 
and design rights) are written and 
communicated to the organisation in a 
way that resonates with and engages 
asosers.the security of our customer data will be 
a key focus in the financial year ahead, 
and this will be regularly monitored by 
the committee.the long-term incentive 
award that vested at the end of the financial 
year was subject to three year performance 
conditions for the period from 1 september 
2014 to 31 august 2017, relating to the 
compound annual growth rate in earnings 
per share, which came in at 19.8%, and  
asos’ total shareholder return compared 
to a basket of companies from the ftse 
all-share general retailers index, where 
asos ranked in the upper quartile.we have 
listened to the feedback raised last year 
and will reflect this in our approach to the 
ongoing governance of remuneration at 
asos.the guideline limit for the ceo and other 
executive directors is 500% and 200% of 
salary respectively.the board 
is guided by the general 
increase for the broader 
employee population and 
takes into account relevant 
market movements.the granting of payments or share awards on joining in order to secure the appointment of an executive director or senior executive 
is normally limited to the fair value of any deferred remuneration that would be forfeited at the previous employer, taking into account 
relevant factors including the form of the awards, remaining vesting period and the likelihood of any performance conditions being met.altis awards
altis awards will be made to the ceo and cfo in 2017/18 with a face value of 200% of salary, as set out on page 68.
