the number of agency offices was up 1% since the start of 
the year to a record high of 17,626 (2016: 17,462), with the 
growth attributable to an increase in resale branch numbers 
(including growth in the number of branch equivalents for 
members operating an online or a hybrid model).these two causes are very important to our employees 
and fund raising efforts are well underway as part of our ‘on the 
move’ campaign, with over £1,200 raised in the last four weeks 
of 2017. we have set our employees a target of raising £26,000, 
to be split equally between both charities and rightmove will

• t echnology and innovation
• voice of the consumer and retail
• digital marketing and online media, and

on an annual basis taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during 
meetings.the executive directors do not hold any 
other non-executive directorships or commitments 
requiring disclosure under the code.the company presently 
takes votes at general meetings on a show of hands on the 
grounds of practicality , owing to the limited number of 
shareholders in attendance.andrew findlay and peter williams are also  
qualified accountants and andrew findlay is currently  
chief financial officer of easyjet plc.•  is the annual report free of unnecessary clutter?effectiveness and reappointment
the committee considered the quality and effectiveness of 
the external audit process, in light of the frc’s practice aid 
for audit committees (may 2015).the committee met three times during the year and 
attendance at the meetings is shown on page 36.
membership 
the committee is comprised entirely of non-executive 
directors, whose biographical details can be found on pages 
30 to 31. as at 31 december 2017, all the non-executive 
directors (five out of six members of the committee) were 
considered by the board to be independent.a copy of the terms of reference of the committee can be found 
on the company’s website at: plc.rightmove.co.uk.the whole board discussed the feedback at the committee 
meeting in december 2017 and concluded that the board and 
its committees continue to operate effectively , with an open 
and effective board dynamic resulting in effective challenge  
and collaboration between non-executive and executive 
directors.•  agreed the process for and considered actions based upon 
the findings of the board evaluation;
•  considered potential conflicts of interest for non-executive 
directors appointed to other boards; 
•  reviewed and considered actions to address the group’s 
gender pay gap; and
• conducted an annual review of its terms of reference.the shares held by the sip are 
awarded as free shares to eligible employees in january of each 
year and are held in trust for a period of three years before an 
employee is entitled to take ownership of the shares.we consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a  
whole, is fair , balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.we have valued the engagement 
with and support of our shareholders and we remain focused 
on disclosing clearly how much our executive directors earn 
and how this links to the group’s performance.the key principles of the committee’s policy are that 
executive remuneration should:
•  allow the company to attract and retain talented individuals 
who are critical to the success of the business;
•  be simple to explain, understand and administer; 
•  be regarded as fair by both other employees and 
shareholders;
•  be below market levels for base salary with minimal benefits 
(which are made available on the same basis to all 
rightmove employees) and above market levels of variable 
pay potential;
•  provide directors with the opportunity to receive a share  
in the future growth and development of the group; 
•  align the interests of the executive directors with the 
interests of shareholders and reflect the dynamic, 
performance-driven culture of the group;
•  principally reward individuals for the overall success of the 
business, measuring and incentivising directors against key 
short-term and medium to long-term goals; 
•  not enable executive directors to gain significantly from 
short-term successes, which subsequently prove not to be 
consistent with growing the overall value of the business.the committee considers both 
individual and group performance 
in a broad context when 
determining base salary increases.maximum (% salary): 
125% of base salary
the bonus is determined by and 
based on performance against  
a range of key performance 
indicators which will be selected 
and weighted to support delivery 
of the business strategy.the company does not contribute to any personal 
pension arrangements.long-term incentives
the award levels under the psp, approved in 2017, remain  
at 200% of base salary for both executive directors.(3) based on the results of the annual employee survey.the performance 
shares are exercisable for a period of two years from 9 may 
2020 and are subject to the same performance criteria as 
the original award granted on 1 march 2017. the number 
of additional shares was based on the average mid-market 
share price for the three consecutive days prior to grant, 
taken from the daily official list, of £41.90.based solely on our work on the other information  
described above: 
•  with respect to the corporate governance statement 
disclosures about internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and 
about share capital structures: 
-  we have not identified material misstatements therein; 
and 
-  the information therein is consistent with the financial 
statements; and 
•  in our opinion, the corporate governance statement has 
been prepared in accordance with relevant rules of the 
disclosure guidance and t ransparency rules of the
