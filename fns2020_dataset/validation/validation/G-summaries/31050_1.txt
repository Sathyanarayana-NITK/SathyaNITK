report on the audit of the group financial statements
opinion
in our opinion:
• sirius minerals plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the financial statements) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 december 2017 and of the group’s loss 
and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european 
union;
• the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with united kingdom generally 
accepted accounting practice (united kingdom accounting standards, comprising frs 101 reduced disclosure 
framework’, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.we have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.the group’s operations are predominantly in the united kingdom.the group is required to estimate the net present value of future restoration obligations in settling upon the 
value of provisions to recognise at each measurement date.under the terms of the convertible loan, the group has also been required to set aside an amount in an escrow bank account in 
respect of all coupon payments due until 28 november 2019, which is disclosed as part of restricted cash.due to the conversion terms of the loans leading to the issuance of a fixed number of ordinary shares in the company in return 
for the extinguishment of the bonds whose value is variable in terms of the company’s functional currency of sterling, the group 
has accounted for the bonds as a host loan instrument containing an embedded derivative liability in respect of the 
conversions features.
