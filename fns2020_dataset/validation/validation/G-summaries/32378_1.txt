the goodwill at 31 march 2017 and 31 march 2016 relates to the acquisition of stb systems limited, since renamed lombard risk 
compliance limited, which was acquired in 2005 and which constituted the group’s regulatory compliance business, and to goodwill 
arising in 2011 relating to the acquisition of the regulatory reporting business of sofgen.management has concluded that 
no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.the net carrying value of the above were fully written down, resulting in an impairment charge of £469,000, which 
was included in the administrative expenses line of the statement of comprehensive income.this review involved a 
consideration of the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, 
and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.47 annual report and accounts 2017 lombard risk management plc

the current amounts are short term and the directors consider that the carrying amount of these trade and other receivables 
approximates to their fair value.the group’s main 
ongoing transactional exposure is to be long of the euro and the us dollar through the euro and the us dollar income exceeding 
expenditure in those currencies and short of chinese yuan through expenditure exceeding income in that currency.mitigation: the group finances its operations through retained cash reserves and overdraft facilities.for the year under review the volatility ranged between 32.5% 
to 43.8%, giving a charge to profit and loss for the year ended 31 march 2017 of £196,332 (2016: £182,745) offset by lapsed share 
option reversal of £15,589, with the same amount being credited to reserves.the contractual life is 
between five and ten years from the date of grant.the directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the period to 30 june 2018, which shows that the company and group have 
sufficient facilities for ongoing operations.whilst there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the aforementioned 
forecasts, the directors believe the company and group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements.accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 march 2017.
