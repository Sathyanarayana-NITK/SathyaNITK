it played host to a number of 
transatlantic passengers in 1912, the night 
before they boarded the titanic, hence the 
reason it is named after the ill-fated ship’s 
operating company.finally, it has been a busy year for both cornish 
orchards and nectar with notable infrastructure 
investments in both businesses.the group treasury team monitors the overall 
level of financial gearing weekly, with our short and 
medium term forecasts showing underlying levels 
of gearing which remain within our targets.we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the nlw legislation through review of our staff 
hours and pricing strategies and we are in a unique competitive position as we already pay the 
majority of our employees above the nlw.these have included a skydive by the team 
at the mill at elstead, undertaking the three 
peaks challenge by team members at the rose 
& crown in ealing and a £1 cheque challenge by 
the red lion hotel in hillingdon who collected 
over 600 £1 cheques for the charity.fuller’s makes a number of donations through 
the charities aid foundation to charities that 
are either local to our sites at chiswick, 
horndean in hampshire and duloe in cornwall, 
that have relevance to us due to the nature of 
our industry, such as alcohol-related charities, or 
that involve a connection to the business such as 
through an employee.we have also 
worked hard to put more low fat/light options on 
the menu and increased the range of dishes 
suitable for vegans and vegetarians.directors 
a list of directors who served during the financial year, together with 
biographical details, is given on pages 38 and 39. 
ian bray resigned as a director with effect from 31 may 2016. on the 
recommendation of the nominations committee, simon dodd was 
appointed by the board of directors with effect from 1 august 2016.  
in accordance with the articles of association, his reappointment will be 
subject to the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting.the lenders shall not be obliged to fund any 
new borrowing requests and the facilities will lapse after 30 days from  
the change of control if terms on which they can continue have not been 
agreed.board meetings
the board meets formally at least six times a year with papers circulated a 
week in advance and the agenda and papers for these meetings are subject 
to the scrutiny of the chairman and the company secretary.the non-executive directors from 
time to time meet with members of the senior management team at the 
brewery and also spend days out in the trade with individual members of 
that team.during its review of the group’s financial statements for the period  to         
1 april 2017, the audit committee has reviewed the key judgements 
applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, 
including those communicated by the auditors during their reporting.the internal audit reports, the management 
responses and the recommended actions are presented in summary  
form to the audit committee on a regular basis.the chairman arranges for the chairman of each 
of the company’s board committees to answer relevant questions at the 
meeting and encourages all directors to be present.i hope that 
you find the report clear and comprehensive and that it helps demonstrate 
how the remuneration of your directors is very much linked to the 
performance of your company, and that you are able to support the 
resolutions on remuneration being presented to you at this year’s 
annual general meeting.when setting the remuneration policy, the committee considered the 
group’s performance on environmental, social and governance matters.if profits have 
declined to a specified degree in the year bonuses are due to  
be paid, the committee will assess the performance of the 
group relative to a selected peer group.payments will only  
be authorised if the group has performed better than the 
average of the peer group and where the group’s performance 
represents outperformance.the target for the bonus includes the cost of the bonus itself.the performance targets and restrictions are considered 
to be a realistic test of management performance and were 
chosen because they are consistent with corporate profit 
growth objectives and ensure that options only become 
exercisable against the background of a sustained real 
increase in the financial performance of the group.the fees paid to the chairman are determined by the remuneration committee.in determining whether an executive director should be treated as a good leaver and the extent to which bonuses, awards and share options vest or  
become exercisable, and/or a pro-rated bonus is due, the committee will take into account the circumstances of an individual’s departure and his or  
her performance.2
 bonus refers to the annual bonus scheme based on performance in the period under review and the value of free shares awarded under the sip (£3,000).net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business less estimated costs of completion and the costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.at the point a trade receivable is written off the ledger as uncollectible, the cost is charged against the allowance account and any subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.the current estimate of the amount 
payable for the remaining 24% is £3.4 million, of which £2.8 million is accrued at the balance sheet date, with the balance to be accrued over the 
remaining period to 31 march 2018.
there was no property impairment in the period.the onerous lease provision release of £0.2 million in the prior period relates to a leasehold property disposed during the prior period.notes to the financial statements continued
