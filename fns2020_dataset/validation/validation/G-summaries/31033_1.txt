step change in efficiency and environmental 
performance for ‘middle of the market’ up  
to large widebody aircraft.we continue to attract high numbers of

the board to assess the effectiveness of 
management and mitigation of the risk, 
including consideration of the effectiveness 
of material internal controls.— focusing on being responsive to our customers and improving 
the quality, delivery and reliability of our products and services.we actively reviewed and responded to  
the frc’s consultation to the uk corporate 
governance code.in addition to the board’s principal committees, it has 
established a sub-committee of directors who each  
hold an appropriate level of uk national security clearance 
for the purpose of receiving and considering, on behalf  
of the board, any uk classified information relating to  
the group’s programmes and activities.the board diversity policy was presented in november 
and approved in december 2017. the board confirmed its support 
for the group’s updated diversity and inclusion policies and the 
introduction of group targets to increase the percentage of  
roles held by women and other under-represented groups across 
the group.one employee, interviewed immediately after the meeting  
said, “it was really helpful to have the apparent barriers broken 
down that can sometimes exist between the board and the 
people that work in the organisation.as well as attending numerous investor conferences and roadshows 
in the uk, europe and the us, we were also active at trade-related

keeps the group’s corporate governance arrangements under 
review and ensures they are consistent with best practice standards.sector audit committees
to strengthen the ownership of accounting policies and controls, 
and to support our work, each of the group’s businesses and 
principal functions has its own sector audit committee.key risks and the audit approach to these risks are discussed in  
the independent auditor’s report (pages 183 to 194), which  
also highlights the other significant risks that kpmg drew to our 
attention.we reviewed the work of the 
product safety process council, part of the role of which is to ensure 
that the product safety processes are clearly understood and 
effective.we were kept 
updated on the programme to address the issues previously 
identified on the trent 1000 fleet and were satisfied with the 
approach taken from a safety perspective.sir frank chapman

a new executive-level environment and sustainability committee, 
co-chaired by the chief operating officer and chief technology 
officer, was formed during the year to provide executive level 
oversight of the group’s response to sustainability issues including 
policy, approach and related kpis.in may, as part of the review of competitiveness of civil aero engines, 
we visited our site in derby, uk, where we received a tour of the 
trent xwb final assembly and test facility, the large aero engine 
development test facility and test preparation area.the directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a 
contribution to the development costs that the group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share.the payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme revenue for their production components are charged to cost of sales  
as programme revenue arise.a liability is recognised to the extent that the minimum 
funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus.the cost of shares of rolls-royce holdings plc held by the group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share 
plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet.engine flying hours, 
based on historical forecasting experience, the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer and the customer’s creditworthiness.in broad terms the impact of the standard will be to:
 – recognise an additional lease liability equivalent to the present value of the lease commitments at the date of transition.the estimate of value in use is approximately £50m higher than the carrying value and deterioration of key assumptions could result in an 
impairment.in addition, the group has £2,106m (2016: £2,280m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities of which £2,000m is available for at least 
the next two years.in the uk, 
and in the principal us and canadian pension schemes, the group has adopted investment policies to mitigate some of these risks.2017

the differences between the sensitivities on obligations and plan assets arise largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting purposes and the 
adopted proxy solvency basis.** 
the entity is not included in the consolidation as rolls-royce plc does not have a beneficial interest in the net assets of the entity.we challenged the appropriateness of 
the key assumptions underlying the forecast cash flows (including 
program assumptions and the terminal value growth rate) and 
compared these to the group’s own forecasts where itp aero’s 
and the group’s businesses overlapped.we considered the 
extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our 
procedures on the related financial statements items.
