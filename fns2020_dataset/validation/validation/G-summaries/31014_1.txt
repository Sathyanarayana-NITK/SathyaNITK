although the ultimate success of anglo pacific 
will depend on its ability to continue to add value 
enhancing royalties and streams to its portfolio, 
the focus of the viability statement is on the 
existing business of the group and the ability of 
the current royalty portfolio to generate 
sufficient cash to meet the group’s outgoings, 
including the dividend.in its agm presentation, published on 
june 7, 2017, noront indicated that the 
eagle’s nest project is currently within  
the feasibility stage, while preliminary 
economic analysis is being undertaken in 
respect of the blackbird and black thor 
projects, with the latter being subject to 
the group’s ring of fire royalty.the strength of the cash generated in 2017 meant that the group repaid all of its outstanding borrowings and ended the year debt free with 
£8.1m in cash.the executive committee is no longer a formal board 
committee because it is not currently comprised of a majority of 
executive directors.meier

and risk management systems across the group.• procedures developed by management to identify and evaluate 
key business, financial and operational risks, and the effectiveness 
of the responses being implemented to mitigate the potential 
impacts.the board also receives reports from its other 
committees and directly from management.in addition, the

behalf of all staff.the ceo’s performance against corporate and personal objectives  
is assessed by the chairman and the committee at the beginning  
of the following year, and bonus is awarded on the basis of the 
agreed criteria.this reflects a pool equal to 10% for the original awards and a pool for the new awards

this part of the report details the remuneration paid to directors during 2017 with a comparison to the previous year.the remuneration committee was conscious of the need to ‘’sense 
check’’ the bonus arrangements for the ceo both for major negative 
external influences and for truly outstanding performance.in addition, many of the bonus criteria are referenced to the 
achievement of hurdle performance that is either ‘’superior’ or 
‘’exceptional’’.in addition, a development royalty, 
brazilian nickel, was acquired in september 2017. growth bonus in 
relation to these transactions was 10%.in addition, the vcp is designed to increase this alignment.the rights to subscribe for ordinary shares conferred by

key audit 
matters
the key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• valuation of the kestrel royalties
• impairment assessment of the royalties intangibles portfolio
• accounting for the denison transaction
• accounting for deferred and current tax 
within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters which are the same as the prior 
year are identified with  .principal risks and viability statement
based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge we 
obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of 
the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 18-23 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors' confirmation on page 18 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 18 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.considering 
that these are often bought in the development 
phase of an asset's life a significant portion of the 
company’s value at this moment is not reflected 
in the income statement.report on other legal and regulatory requirements
opinions on other matters prescribed by the companies act 2006
in our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the companies 
act 2006.
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.the royalty income derived from assets classified as 
intangibles will be accounted for in accordance with ifrs 15, which the directors do not believe will have a material impact on the recognition 
and disclosure of revenue.lease costs will be recognised in the income statement in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use asset over the 
lease term, and finance charges representing the unwinding of the discount on the lease liability.upon commencement of production at the underlying mining operation intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life 
of the mine.apg_ar17_28.03.18_back_artwork
