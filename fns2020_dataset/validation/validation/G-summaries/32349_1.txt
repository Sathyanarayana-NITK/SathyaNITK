change in level of risk
the health and safety of our people

who undertake high risk activities, 
such as climbing telegraph poles, 
working in confined spaces, 
working alone or working next to 
roads.responsibility 
for the overall sustainability strategy 
sits with our chief executive, bill halbert.we continue to be an active member of local business organisations 
including humber bondholders, which promotes the region as 
a destination for inward investment; for entrepreneurs only, 
a community interest company that helps local entrepreneurs 
create jobs and wealth; and c4di (centre for digital innovation), 
a technology hub that is helping to drive the development of the 
digital economy locally.we continue to encourage 
our employees to travel only when necessary, although we 
acknowledge that some travel is essential in order to do 
business and it is important that we are able to meet face-to-
face with our customers whenever necessary.the audit committee report can be found 
on page 45, the nomination committee report on page 43

the year are shown in the table above.the nomination committee is a sub-committee of the board 
and meets as often as required.it is responsible for reviewing 
the structure, size and composition of the board and ensuring 
that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the 
board is right for the group, both for the current challenges 
and opportunities facing the group and the skills and expertise 
that are expected to be needed on the board in the future.the key principle set out in the policy is that the board will 
always seek to appoint on merit.the board recognises the 
benefits of diversity of all types, including gender, professional 
and ethnic diversity, and will always aim to develop the diversity 
of the board in order to promote a range of perspectives in the 
boardroom, while remaining true to the key principle of 
appointing on merit.nomination committee report

corporate governance continued
board appointments policy continued
in addition, through the board appointments policy, the board 
has committed to:
 > continue to seek to identify and develop the talented 
individuals in the business, regardless of gender;
 > review regularly the proportion of women at each level 
in the organisation to ensure that equal opportunities are 
being presented to individuals at every level; and
 > always ensure that there is a confidential way in which 
concerns can be raised without fear of repercussion if anyone, 
regardless of gender, has a concern about the opportunities 
available to them.the annual bonus provides 
reward for financial performance above market expectations in the 
year and the ltip focuses executive directors on the medium to 
long-term value created for shareholders.> annual report on remuneration, showing how the 
current remuneration policy has been applied in 
2016/17, how we intend to apply the proposed policy in 
2017/18 and a summary of the work of the remuneration 
committee in the year.details of the final vesting result 
will be included in our remuneration report next year.long-term incentives 
long-term incentive schemes are used to drive 
growth in shareholder value and to ensure that 
there is a direct link between reward and superior 
shareholder returns.the plan allows a maximum award of 150 per cent of salary per annum and 
this would be the normal level of award made to the executive directors.we believe that requiring the executive directors to hold shares further reinforces 
the alignment between their interests and those of shareholders and reduces the potential for behaviours and actions which are 
detrimental to the long-term health of the company.we are aware of the support expressed by some shareholders for the downward harmonisation 
of executive pension allowances to bring them into line with the percentages for the wider 
workforce and we will continue to closely monitor how market practice and investor views 
develop in this area.> the committee has discretion regarding the treatment of companies within the comparator group which cease to be listed.> the bonus scheme for the 2016/17 year was discussed and it was agreed that it was 
appropriate to retain the same metrics as in the previous financial year and the specific 
targets for the year were confirmed.scheduled meeting in 
february 2017
 > feedback from the largest shareholders in relation to the proposed revised remuneration 
policy was reviewed and the policy was discussed.scheduled meeting in 
march 2017
 > further feedback from shareholders on the proposed revised remuneration policy was 
reviewed and the final version of the policy was discussed and agreed.further information was sought 
on this prior to making a decision at the next committee meeting.isas (uk & ireland) reporting
under isas (uk & ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > information in the annual report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the group and parent company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.control exists when the company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.for the year ended 31 march 2017, the board considered four segments in assessing the performance of the group and making 
decisions in relation to the allocation of resources.09 finance costs
