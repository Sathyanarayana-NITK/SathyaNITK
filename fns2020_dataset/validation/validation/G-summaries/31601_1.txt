financial review
the financial performance for 2017 has been another strong 
result, building on the transition we achieved in 2016 and the 
business is now repositioned for growth.as a board, 
we need to lead the business through this period of change, 
providing the appropriate balance between supporting and 
challenging the management.as a board, we need to continue to encourage this openness, 
and ensure we have a culture that puts customers at the heart 
of our business.strong governance 
supports the 
implementation  
of our strategy

grainger plc annual report and accounts 2017 compliance with the uk corporate governance 
code 2016 (the ‘code’)
the governance rules applying to all uk companies on the 
official list of the uk listing authority are set out in the code, 
published by the frc.we anticipate that we will engage 
with fund managers and corporate governance officers of our 
major shareholders before the agm in february 2018. 
we provide further details of our shareholder engagement 
programme on pages 59 to 61. 
how the board supports strategy
building on the progress made previously, the board spent 
a significant portion of its time this year reviewing the key 
elements of the implementation of the prs strategy, such as 
the operating model, development pipeline, technology strategy, 
asset hierarchy and customer proposition.in particular, we plan to spend time reviewing 
further opportunities to grow our prs base over the coming 
years and consider the implementation of the technological and 
cultural changes required to implement our customer-focused 
prs strategy.chief financial officer responsible for the financial stewardship of the group’s resources through compliance and good judgement.this included the 
completion of a detailed questionnaire, followed by individual 
meetings with each of the directors and the company secretary.in accordance with the code, we intend the next 
external evaluation of the board to be carried out in 2020. 
election and re-election of directors
we continue to adopt the recommendations of the code that all 
directors offer themselves for re-election annually, even though 
the company’s articles of association only require this every 
three years.these included:
 » greater customer focus being brought to grainger’s strategy, recognising the business’s move to prs;
 » the board giving greater focus to succession planning; and
 » plans to give non-executive directors greater exposure to a wider range of staff, and to bring greater external perspective to the board.the committee supported this proposal and recommended to 
the board that it be adopted.we also considered that the external valuers were sufficiently independent and report directly 
to the committee.helen gordon and vanessa simms held the vast 
majority of these meetings, and manage the group’s investor 
relations programme with the director of corporate affairs.the performance 
against adjusted earnings was £7 .8m ahead of the target set  
for the year of £66.6m, and rose was in the lower half of the 
5%–15% performance range.full disclosure of the 
actual targets set, and performance towards those targets,  
is on pages 69 to 71. 
with our ltip, the 2014 awards will vest in december 2017.  
the performance targets for this award related to epra nnnav 
(50% of award) and absolute tsr.depending on the circumstances, the committee 
may also apply the principle of mitigation, to reduce any 
termination payment.in respect of the personal performance targets set for each executive director, these were set against a range of strategic targets  
at the start of the year.following consideration of the performance against the objectives set, the committee determined that payment of 12.5% of the 
maximum 20% of this part of the bonus was appropriate in the circumstances.however, due  
to their materiality in the context of the  
parent company financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had the greatest 
effect on our overall parent company audit.we are required to report to you if the corporate governance 
statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the uk corporate governance code 
specified by the listing rules for our review.the directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare  
the group financial statements on a going concern basis.where the group owns less than 50% of the voting 
rights but acts as property and/or asset manager an assessment is made as to whether or not the group has de facto control over 
an investee.the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below.the most 
significant of these, and their potential impact on the group’s accounting, are set out below:
• ifrs 9 financial instruments (effective from 1 april 2018) – the standard applies to classification and measurement of financial 
assets and financial liabilities, impairment provisioning and hedge accounting.the group 
will consider reclassification of individual assets if it is appropriate and circumstances meet the definitions and requirements 
of the amendment.in relation to the group’s investment in associates, the group’s share of the aggregated assets, liabilities, revenues and profit or loss 
of associates is shown below:

on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the 
vesting period.a significant proportion of the group’s non-cancellable operating leases relate to regulated 
tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives.we are assessing the long-term impact with our advisers and aim to collaborate with other affected

period, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at that date.
