role and responsibility of the committee
the role of the audit and risk committee was authorised by the board and its 
main duties in 2017 are listed below:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the group 
including its annual and half-yearly reports, any interim management 
statements and other formal announcements relating to sanne’s 
financial performance.sanne-ar2017 front-proof13.indd   54 23/03/2018   16:24:22 25754 – 23 march 2018 4:19 pm – proof 13

corporate governance
principal risks and uncertainties
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company are set out in the 
risk management report section of the strategic report on pages 22 to 26. 
external audit
independence is vital for the integrity of the audit.the internal audit plan was discussed and approved by the committee 
including subsequent changes.the internal audit reports detailing issues identified 
and management action taken to improve the control environment were 
presented to the committee for their consideration.viability statement 
the directors have assessed the viability of the group over a three year 
period, taking account of the group's current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks documented in the strategic report.the committee is conscious that 
salary levels, at the time of setting 
this policy, are positioned below 
mid-market levels and this policy 
contains flexibility to increase salary 
levels as the company matures and 
the pre-ipo share awards unwind.however, where the individual is considered 
a ‘good leaver’ (in the event of death, injury, 
disability, retirement with the agreement of his or 
her employer, redundancy, or sale of employing 
company or business out of the group or for any 
other reason at the discretion of the committee) 
the committee may determine that such individual 
shall remain eligible for consideration for the 
payment of a prorated bonus on the normal 
payment date (or such earlier date the committee 
determines).the out-turns, therefore, are not what the committee expects to award in future years and instead arise as a result of 2017 being a transition year.underlying profit before tax is one of the key financial metrics at sanne and 
the targets have been set by the committee after taking account of the company’s business plan and external expectations, with full payment being made only 
in the case of exceptionally strong performance.a two year post-vest holding period will apply, creating a five year period between the grant of an award and the first opportunity to sell (the net of tax) vested 
shares.25754 – 23 march 2018 4:19 pm – proof 13
