the company secretary
all the directors have access to the advice 
and services of the company secretary.the results of the review were discussed 
by the board in january 2018. overall the 
review found that the board continued to 
work effectively and that each director 
demonstrates full commitment to his/
her duties and contributes in an open and 
transparent way, enabling a detailed level 
of debate and discussion around material 
matters affecting the group.the committee 
noted the proposals of management to 
continue to enhance the methodology 
applied and were supportive of these 
plans.whilst acknowledging that the setting of 
reserves to cover future claims is a complex 
and judgemental area and having had the 
opportunity at the separate meetings 
referred to above to consider and question the 
recommended best estimates, the committee 
is satisfied that an appropriate process has 
been followed and that there has been scrutiny, 
challenge and debate to give confidence that 
the reserving levels set provide an appropriate 
margin above best estimates, though note the 
continued high level of prudence that remains 
within the reserves.the group has a ‘three lines of defence’ 
approach to internal control, including those 
controls that relate to the financial reporting 
process.in this context and in 
keeping with its remit to review regularly 
the composition and experience of the 
board, the committee led the process of 
non-executive board appointments during 
the year.it also reflects a move towards 
improving internal consistency between the 
cfo’s remuneration structure and that of the 
broader admiral executive team below the 
board, for whom a proportion of their share 
awards are subject to continued employment 
but not subject to the dfss vesting criteria.a 
scorecard of risk performance measures 
will be set by the committee each year for 
all significant areas of the business with 
specified targets to determine the amount of 
any dfss bonus adjustment.the committee 
continues to hold the view that this is 
appropriate, as his significant shareholding 
provides a sufficient alignment of his 
interest with those of other shareholders.the committee is satisfied that the advice provided by mercer kepler is independent.the directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the companies act 
2006. they have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.valuation of gross insurance claims reserves 
key audit matter 
description
the group’s gross insurance claims reserves total £2,403m (2016 year-end: £2,031m).key observations based on our procedures above, we considered the profit commission to be appropriately calculated.conversely, the spanish branch of admiral insurance 
company limited was brought into the scope of these specified procedures for the first time in 2017, due to the specific audit risks which the 
branch presents to the underwriting subsidiary.–  the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial 
position is expected to be significantly impacted, with material 
lease liabilities and ‘right of use’ assets being included for the 
first time.• the risks included on the group’s risk register that could impact 
on the group’s financial performance, levels of liquidity and 
solvency over the next 12 months.refer to the section on estimation techniques below, 
and the analysis of insurance risk in note 5 to the financial statements 
for further detail on the development of the group’s reserving 
methodology applied during the period and the calculation of the 
projected best estimate outcome.for equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares 
granted as determined at the grant date (excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions).the financial statements are 
prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss.a pre-tax discount rate of 11% has been used, calculated using a capital asset pricing model (capm) calculation (using a risk free return plus 
an appropriate risk premium), given that an asset specific rate is not available from the market.
