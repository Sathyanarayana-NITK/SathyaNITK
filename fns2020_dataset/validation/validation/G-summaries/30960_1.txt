financial statements governance strategic report
the total remuneration figures for the ceo during the 2017 financial year are shown in the table below.the board and committee evaluation process in 2017 was led by the 
nomination committee with support from lintstock, a london-based 
advisory firm that specialises in the facilitation of board performance 
reviews.we have audited the financial statements of gulf marine services plc 
(the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of financial 
position;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes  
in equity;
• the consolidated and parent company cash flow statements;
• the related notes 1 to 37 in respect of the group and 1 to 13  
in respect of the parent company.the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and 
ifrss as adopted by the european union.the period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous renewals and re-appointments of the firm is 4 years, covering  
the years ending 31 december 2014 to 31 december 2017.
consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required 
to provide in accordance with isas (uk).the application of these new and revised 
ifrss has not had any material impact on the amounts reported for the current and prior years but may affect the accounting for future 
transactions or arrangements.reimbursable costs are recognised on the gross basis, as 
both revenues and expenses, because the group is the primary obligor in the arrangement, has discretion in supplier selection, is involved  
in determining product or service specifications and assumes full credit risk related to the reimbursable costs.interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.trade and other payables, bank borrowings, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties and other liabilities are classified  
as ‘other financial liabilities’.in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a real pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.the composition of the other vessels segment, which are non-core assets, was amended during the year following 
the sale of two anchor handling tugs, and the reclassification of the vessel naashi from small class vessels to other vessels following its 
impairment (comparative figures have also been adjusted to reflect this).non-market vesting conditions, which for the group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, and 
in the case of the senior management ltip awards the achievement of eps growth targets, are taken into account by adjusting the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period 
is based on the number of options that eventually vest.revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.the company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy 
counterparties, for whom the credit risk is assessed to be low.auditor’s remuneration
10. to authorise the audit and risk committee to determine the remuneration of the auditor on behalf of the board of directors.shareholders are invited to vote on the directors’ 
remuneration report, which appears on pages 44 to 55 in the 2017 annual report and accounts (excluding the directors remuneration policy 
set out on pages 44 to 55 of the 2017 annual report and accounts (the “directors’ remuneration policy”)).a reconciliation of this measure is provided in note 6 of these results.
