the directors’ report (covering pages 2 to 113 and 184 to 198) includes the following information relating to the group:
 • financial position, including cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities
 • business activities together with factors likely to affect future development, performance and financial position
 • objectives, policies and processes for managing capital
 • financial risk management objectives
 • details of hedging activity and exposures to credit and liquidity risk
in addition to evaluating the lrp, as part of its wider assessment of ongoing viability the board considered:
 • its assessment of the company’s principal risks and uncertainties (as outlined on pages 18 to 21)
 • its monitoring and review of the company’s risk management and internal control systems (as outlined on page 68)
 • reporting and assurance that it receives from its committees, members of management and the group’s 
external auditor
 • the impact of significant projects, strategic developments and other significant commitments on the company’s 
risk profile, including the acquisition of baxalta in 2016, and the establishment of separate rare disease and 
neuroscience divisions in 2018
details of the group’s financial instruments are disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.the 
feedback we received was valuable and 
influenced the development of the new 
remuneration policy.• the cost to the company of providing other 
benefits may vary year on year depending on 
market practice and the cost of insuring 
certain benefits.• the maximum has been reduced to move the 
contribution levels towards that of the broader 
employee population while maintaining a 
competitive rate of contribution.• the executive director shall be eligible to participate in shire’s employee benefit plans, including coverage under all executive 
and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as may be 
amended by the company in its sole discretion from time to time.• the committee’s policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as a 
result of change in control.to the extent that the 
net product sales and non gaap ebitda measures are achieved, 20 percent of the award is payable for threshold performance and 
100 percent payable for maximum vesting, with straight-line vesting within this performance range.the committee reviews share ownership levels annually for this group.subject to the 
companies act, the board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, 
whenever the financial position of the 
company, in the opinion of the board, 
justifies its payment.the level of change in the current year, and 
cumulatively, creates a risk that key financial 
processes may fail to operate effectively.the excess of the fair value of consideration 
transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill.the company calculates the fair value using significant estimates 
and assumptions including but not limited to: revenues and 
operating profits related to the products, existing competitive 
activities and acts by governments and courts.cost of sales
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing finished product 
for sale, the cost of raw materials and costs of manufacturing 
those products including shipping and handling costs, depreciation 
and amortization of intangible assets in respect of favorable 
manufacturing contracts.uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements for positions which are considered more likely than not 
of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position 
on audit by the tax authorities.intangible assets related to commercially marketed products 
are amortized over their estimated useful lives on an economic 
consumption method, or a straight-line basis when straight-line 
method approximates economic consumption method.if actual events differ from 
management’s estimates, or to the extent that these estimates 
are adjusted in the future, any changes to the valuation allowance 
could significantly impact the company’s financial condition and 
results of operations.selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term 
and long-term historical trends and known economic and market 
conditions at the time of the measurement date.as of december 31, 2017, cash payments associated 
with these costs were not significant.the in-line committee focuses on commercializing marketed 
products and support of the development of the company’s 
pipeline candidates.167 shire annual report 2017

risks related to the business
the company’s products may not be a 
commercial success
the commercial success of the company’s 
marketed products and other new products 
that the company may launch in the future, 
will depend on their approval and 
acceptance by physicians, patients, 
insurers and other key decision-makers, as 
well as the receipt of marketing approvals in 
different countries, the time taken to obtain 
such approvals, the scope of marketing 
approvals as reflected in the product labels, 
approval of reimbursement at commercially 
sustainable prices in those countries where 
price and reimbursement is negotiated, and 
safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-
effectiveness of the product as compared 
to competitive products.failures by these partners to 
meet their contractual, regulatory, or 
other obligations to the company, or any 
disruption in the relationships between the 
company and these partners, could have 
a material adverse effect on the company’s 
pipeline and business.in addition, there have been and will 
continue to be integration costs and 
non-recurring transaction costs (such 
as fees paid to legal, financial, accounting 
and other advisors and other fees paid in 
connection with the combination) 
associated with the combination, including 
costs associated with combining 
operations and achieving the expected 
synergies as planned, and such costs 
may be significant.the financial statements of the company are consolidated in the 
financial statements of shire plc.in addition, the group also has access to certain short-term 
uncommitted lines of credit which are available to utilize from time 
to time to provide short-term cash management flexibility.the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future.
