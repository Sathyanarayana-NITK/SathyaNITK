despite uncertainty in relation to the outcome of the 
eu referendum and tax changes impacting primarily 
uk based individual investors, our underlying market 
has remained resilient.the shift of our business model towards build to 
rent has helped to cushion us from the impact of 
the tax changes.objectives and strategy
our primary objective is to build more homes in 
london and to grow in a controlled manner to meet 
some of the shortfall between supply and need in the 
capital.in addition, 
for the year to 31 march 2019, we have secured over 
60 per cent of the anticipated gross profit and expect 
profit before tax to exceed £50 million.examples 
include the off-site construction of brick cladding at 
our manhattan plaza development and the use of a 
lightweight metal frame structure at the pavilions, one 
of our build to rent schemes.the group has 
continued to invest in land and work in progress  
but still has substantial headroom within its  
£180 million revolving credit facility available  
to achieve its aspirations of increasing profit  
to over £50 million by march 2019.

'telford homes has experienced another year of excellent 
results, achieving growth in profit before tax for the  
fifth year running from £3 million in 2012 to just over  
£34 million this year.'in 
the year to 31 march 2017, the group exchanged 
contracts to deliver 400 affordable homes (2016: 
87 homes) and entered into three new build to rent 
contracts to deliver 387 build to rent homes (2016: 
156 homes) over the next few years.similar 
to the two sites sold in the prior year for a total 
of £6.7 million, this sale is a result of a change in 
strategic direction where smaller sites have become 
less attractive to build out and the group is able to 
leverage its greater operational size to focus on larger 
scale developments.average borrowings in the year were higher at £55.1 
million (2016: £50.6 million), with the interest charged 
on these borrowings of £2.2 million (2016: £2.2 
million) being capitalised into work in progress as 
required by ias 23.
finance costs charged directly to the income 
statement primarily consist of amortised arrangement 
fees and non-utilisation fees on the group’s £180 
million revolving credit facility and the new £110 million 
facility with lasalle residential finance fund secured 
in july 2016 to fund our joint venture scheme, city 
north.this equates to just over 40 per 
cent of earnings and delivers a yield of circa 
four per cent based on the share price at 31 march 
2017. the final dividend is expected to be paid on  
14 july 2017 to those shareholders on the register  
at the close of business on 16 june 2017.
despite an increase in profit after tax, earnings 
per share has decreased from 39.3 pence to 36.8 
pence.this equates to net assets per 
share of 271.3 pence (31 march 2016: 249.8 pence).the group has 
benefited from low gearing levels throughout the 
year and therefore the margin paid has been at the 
lower end of the range.• the group ensures that the right product and 
systems solutions are integrated early in the 
development lifecycle to minimise project risk.we pride 
ourselves on our unique and supportive 
culture, and have worked hard to inspire this in 
the colleagues that we have welcomed to the 
organisation in the last year.objective 2:
set a target to increase our use 
of sustainably sourced timber
we are committed to procuring at least 90 per cent of our timber 
from sustainable sources such as the forest stewardship council 
(fsc) and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification 
(pefc) chain of custody certification.the chairman is responsible for running the board and he meets 
regularly and separately with the chief executive and the non executive directors to discuss matters for the board.review of the year to 31 march 2017
as described earlier in the annual report the group has performed well during the year, delivering record revenues and profit 
before tax of £291.9 million and £34.1 million respectively.outlook for the year to 31 march 2018

annual bonus
the bonus earned in the year was in relation to the bonus scheme applicable from 1 april 2013 to 31 march 2017. under this 
bonus scheme, each executive director was entitled to earn an annual bonus equivalent to 0.6 per cent of profit before tax 
subject to a minimum level of profits being achieved in each year and capped at 100 per cent of salary at the date the bonus is 
payable.the 
committee makes recommendations to the board on executive directors’ service agreements and remuneration.generally 
the committee meet three times during the year, however in the current year the committee has met five times to enable full 
consideration to be given to the decisions required regarding the new bonus structure and ltip.the principal activity of the group is that of property development.the directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.instead, the group’s 
share of the statutory results from joint ventures is accounted 
for under the equity method.subsequently the 
difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is 
amortised over the length of the payment period and charged to 
inventory, increasing the value of the land creditor so that at the 
date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.the tax base is then 
compared to the cumulative share-based payment expense 
recognised in the income statement.in the year to march 2016, there was £118,000 included within non-audit services in relation to non-recurring fees for financial due 
diligence relating to the acquisition of the regeneration business of united house developments.financial analysis is presented to the 
chief operating decision makers of the group, these being the board of directors, on a site by site basis.detailed disclosures of directors' individual remuneration, pension entitlement and share options for those directors who served 
in the year are given in the tables in the directors' remuneration report on pages 56 to 59 and therefore are not repeated here but 
form part of this note.the financial information of the joint ventures are 
summarised below and reconciled to the group balance sheet.the effective date of the swap is 1 october 
2014 and the maturity date was 30 september 2016, securing the interest rate paid on £50 million of the group's £180 million 
revolving credit facility for this period.in addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group, the company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the strategic report and the report of the 
directors.
