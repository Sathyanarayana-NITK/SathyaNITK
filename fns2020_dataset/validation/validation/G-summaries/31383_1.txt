considerable exposure to commodity price risk is 
inherent in the business.in the us the unconventional oil and gas 
industry developed quickly over a relatively short 
space of time driven by continual innovation and 
technical developments that provided the cost 
efficiencies required for economic production.on completion of the august 2017 
combination transaction, one of our first 
tasks was to assess our abc risks in 
accordance with the uk ‘adequate 
procedures’ guidance and, consequent 
upon that, to update and enhance our

when considering board composition, 
the group policy continues to be that 
the group recruits the best candidate 
available for any position based on merit 
and against objective criteria in order 
to achieve the most effective board.the 
committee agrees with management’s assessment 
that no other indicators of impairment exist in 
respect of the group’s other assets.the performance target ranges 
have been set at stretching levels and 
commensurate with the targets set for 
the relative tsr element of the ltip 
(median to 75th percentile).executive directors may receive 
a contribution to a personal 
pension plan, a cash allowance

opportunity was 50% of the maximum.on 22 january 2018, the company entered a commodity price swap agreement with mercuria energy trading s.a. under which the 
company fixed the price it receives per barrel of oil sold over an 11-month period effective 15 january 2018. the contract is priced 
by reference to a brent benchmark of us$65.97 per barrel in respect of 1,215,954 barrels in total and does not contain provision for 
margin requests.the group’s business plan and exploration programme for 2018 is supported by the conversion of us$100.0 million of a us$160.0 
bridging and working capital agreement previously advanced to the group by mercuria energy trading s.a. into ordinary share 
capital.in addition, the group has entered a new convertible revolving credit facility with the mercuria group in february 2018. this 
new facility provides us$100.0 million of additional capital and, through the restructuring of the interest provisions compared to 
those in the original facility, results in us$11.0 million cash interest cost savings for the remainder of 2018.
additional funding options remain under consideration and could include securing additional third-party bank debt or the issue of 
new equity in the future.the financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required if the group was unable to 
continue as a going concern.we obtained and reviewed management’s assessment of 
the transaction and obtained and read the share purchase 
agreement.we assessed the identification of the appropriate accounting 
treatment, as well as the legal acquirer and acquiree, and the 
implications of this on the presentation of the financial statements; 
this included the comparative numbers being those relating to 
the trefoil group and not the previous andes group.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.2. basis of preparation
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the european union, the associated interpretations issued by the ifrs interpretations committee (together ‘ifrs’) 
and the companies act 2006.
the significant accounting policies applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements are set out below.these policies 
have been consistently applied throughout the period and to each subsidiary of the group.any difference between the total share capital and 
associated share premium and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as merger reserve.the standard describes a five-step approach to be taken to the assessment 
of revenue that requires companies to:
1. identify the customer party to each contract;
2. understand the performance obligations in the contract;
3. determine the transaction price;
4. allocate that price to the identifiable performance obligations; and
5. recognise revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is met.for instance, in the oil and gas industry contracts for the sale of production and for the provision of operational services are often 
priced in us dollars.it recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.interest on available for 
sale securities, held to maturity investments and loans and receivables calculated using the effective interest method is recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss as part of revenue from continuing operations.the forgiveness of the loan is recognised directly in equity within retained earnings in the amount 
of us$31,713,000.as part of the renegotiation integra oil & gas s.a. has agreed to relinquish any interest in these concessions and the 
company is in discussion with integra oil & gas s.a. to agree an appropriate level of compensation.
