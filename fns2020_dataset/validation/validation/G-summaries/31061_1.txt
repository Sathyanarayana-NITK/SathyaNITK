governance
audit committee report
committee composition
the audit committee (‘the committee’) was established in 
august 2016, although a similar committee did operate under 
ring2 communications limited prior to the establishment of 
the group as it currently stands.the board considers the members to have 
relevant and recent financial experience, given their 
biographies as set out on pages 18 and 19.
committee responsibilities
the committee is appointed by and responsible to the board.the committee carried out a full review of the year end 
results and of the audit, using as a basis the reports to the 
committee prepared by the cfo and the external auditor.the committee 
considered all relationships between the external auditor 
and the group and was satisfied that they did not compromise 
the auditor’s judgement or independence, particularly around 
the provision of non-audit services.the board has considered diversity in broader terms than 
gender and believes it is also important to reach the correct 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
on the board.principal activity
the principal activity of the group is the provision of a ‘software-
as-a-service’ (saas) platform for remote business meetings.the group agrees terms of payment 
with each supplier at the start of business and makes 
payments in accordance with these terms.the directors confirm that:
 so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
 the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.who we are reporting to
this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 
2006. our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.testing credit notes raised during the year and subsequent 
to the year-end to ensure revenue was recognised in the 
correct period.the group’s accounting policy on intangible assets is shown 
in note 2.03 to the financial statements and related disclosures 
are included in note 14. 
key observations
our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the 
capitalisation of development costs during the year.our application of materiality
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.this benchmark is considered 
the most appropriate given that the 
group’s results are driven directly by the 
volume of conference services.performance materiality used to 
drive the extent of our testing
materiality for the current year is higher 
than the level that we determined for the 
year ended 31 december 2016 to reflect 
the growth of the group compared to the 
prior year.the other information comprises the information included in the 
annual report & accounts set out on pages 2 to 29, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.our opinion on other matters prescribed by the companies act 2006 is unmodified
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.matters on which we are required to report by exception
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the companies act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 
responsibilities of directors
as explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 29, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.loopup group plc | annual report & accounts 2017
