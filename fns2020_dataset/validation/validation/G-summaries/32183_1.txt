we believe that the standard of the 
delivery service we provide is crucial 
given that the delivery teams are 
typically the only face-to-face 
interaction that customers have 
with the group.this analysis involves 
varying a number of main assumptions underlying the forecasts 
(including, without limitation revenue, margin and working capital), 
and evaluating the monetary impact of severe but plausible risk 
combinations and the likely degree of mitigating actions available to 
the company over the three-year period if such risks did arise.in making their assessment of going concern, the directors considered 
the board‑approved budget, the three‑year business plan, cash flow 
forecast, the availability of a £30m revolving credit facility, the proceeds 
raised from the placing of new shares in the company completed in 
april 2017 and the principal risks set out on pages 42 to 44. 
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and 
the group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of this report.controls on the freedom of 
movement of people may impact 
the availability of workers in the 
uk or the ability of our people to 
move freely between our uk 
business and our mainland 
europe operations.the group is subject to taxes in the uk, germany and the netherlands.year ended

cash resources and cash flow
year-end net funds position was £12.0m (2016: £25.4m), as cash 
decreased to £29.4m (2016: £33.4m) principally reflecting capital 
expenditure in the uk and investment in the new rdc in bergheim 
offset partly by a positive operating cash‑flow of £3.5m (2016: outflow 
of £3.5m), whilst total borrowings (comprising asset finance and bank 
borrowings) increased to £17.4m from £8.0m in 2016. the increase 
principally reflects the funding for investment in the uk’s logistics 
fleet and the new recycling plant in the uk.as a result of this rounding, the totals of data presented in this document may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such data.the company had intended to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation of the board during the reporting period; however, given 
the appointment of the new chairman, geoff cooper, in july 2016, 
who conducted his own evaluation, this review was not considered 
necessary.committee membership
brian is chair of the 
remuneration committee and 
a member of the audit and 
nomination committees.the board is collectively responsible to shareholders 
for the long-term success of the company.further details about these changes and the work of the nomination 
committee is disclosed on pages 60 and 61.
for information on our procedures concerning the appointment and 
replacement of directors, please see the directors’ report on page 81.
board meetings and attendance 
nine board meetings (scheduled in the ordinary course of business) 
were held during the year ended 31 march 2017 and there are currently 
nine meetings scheduled for the year ending 31 march 2017. 
unscheduled supplementary meetings take place as and when 
necessary.geoff cooper became chairman in july 2016 
and given the relatively short amount of time from his appointment to the 
end of the group’s reporting period, an appraisal of his performance by 
the non-executive directors, led by the senior independent director, did 
not occur until shortly after the end of the reporting period.the notice of the agm can be found in a 
booklet which is being mailed out at the same time as this report and can 
also be found on our website www.ao.com/corporate.the company had intended to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation of the board during the reporting period in accordance 
with the provisions of the code.the nomination committee will be 
responsible for ensuring that future external evaluations of the 
board are carried out according to applicable regulations.we do this by relying on: 
(i)  the engagement with the audit committee chair and the lead 
audit engagement partner which will generally be through 
face‑to‑face meetings; 
(ii)  the reports which are brought to the committee by the lead audit 
engagement partner and other senior members of the audit team; 
(iii)  the quality of the management responses to audit queries; meetings 
held with the chief financial officer, director of financial control and 
the chairman with the lead audit engagement partner which are 
reported to myself as audit chair and the committee; and 
(iv)  a review of the independence and objectivity of the audit firm and 
also the quality of the formal audit report given by the auditor to 
shareholders.commission

to register the transfer of a share: 
(1)  in certificated form which is not fully paid provided that if the share 
is listed on the official list of the uk listing authority such refusal 
does not prevent dealings in the shares from taking place on an 
open and proper basis; or
(2)  in certificated form (whether fully paid or not) unless the 
instrument of transfer (a) is lodged, duly stamped, at the office or 
at such other place as the directors may appoint and (except in the 
case of a transfer by a financial institution where a certificate has 
not been issued in respect of the share) is accompanied by the 
certificate for the share to which it relates and such other evidence 
as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer; (b) is in respect of only one class of 
share and (c) is in favour of not more than four transferees; or
(3)  in uncertificated form to a person who is to hold it thereafter in 
certificated form in any case where the company is entitled to 
refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the 
uncertificated securities regulations to register the transfer; or
(4)  where restrictions are imposed by laws and regulations from time 
to time apply (for example insider trading laws).this confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the companies act 2006.
