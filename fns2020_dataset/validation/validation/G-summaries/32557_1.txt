our key suppliers, producers and more than 
50 independent organisations have been involved 
in the peer review of sustainability standards for 
our key raw materials.following the uk’s decision to leave the 
european union (eu) in june 2016, sainsbury’s believe that this risk 
has increased due to the ongoing uncertainty which may adversely 
impact trading performance across the sector.the operating board also holds regular sessions to discuss strategy.sainsbury’s bank transition cost is expected to be around £55 million 
(2016/17: £60 million) and transition capital costs are expected to be around 
£30 million (2016/17: £16 million).the strategy conference was a key opportunity for the board 
to discuss, challenge and focus on strategy, including in-depth reviews of 
the retail market, competition, pricing and promotions, customer insights, 
sainsbury’s bank strategy and the five year corporate plan.during the year, the board also received regular updates on 
progress against the strategy and, in july, it will agree the objectives and 
principal areas of focus for the next strategy conference.all directors were made aware of the key discussions and decisions of each of 
the four principal committees by the chairman of each committee providing 
a detailed summary at the board meeting following the relevant committee 
meeting.audit  
committee
this is my second year on the board and second report as chairman of the 
audit committee.the audit committee reviewed ernst & young’s effectiveness during the 
year.the committee concluded that internal audit continued to 
be effective.the committee will continue to keep the targets under review in light of the acquisition of home retail group plc.the awards for mike coupe and john rogers 
were made on 12 may 2016 and the number of shares has been calculated using the five-day average share price prior to grant (5 to 11 may 2016) of £2.6498.these include:
— the introduction of a two-year holding period on future builder awards granted from 2017 onwards, which means future awards will normally be released  
five years after the grant date;
— shareholding guidelines for executive directors, other than the ceo, are increased to 2.0 times salary, with the requirement for the ceo remaining at 2.5 
times salary;
— retirement benefits for any future appointment are reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent of salary; and
— strengthened recovery provisions (malus and clawback).after the year-end, performance is assessed in the round based on the committee’s judgement of performance achieved.we operate in a dynamic market with 
evolving challenges and the committee reviews the performance measures 
and targets each year to ensure that they remain relevant and stretching.the performance measures in the annual bonus and deferred share award 
are selected as they are the key drivers of business performance.the reporting period is 
the financial year 2016/17, the same as that covered by the annual report 
and financial statements.— using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the 
appropriateness of journal entries impacting revenue, as well as other 
adjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements.risk
the it environment
the it systems across the group are complex and there are varying levels 
of integration between them.in particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired in 
the course of performing the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report and accounts taken 
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
entity’s performance, business model and strategy; and whether the annual report appropriately addresses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee that we consider should have been disclosed.other
— the coupons on the perpetual subordinated capital securities and the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds are accounted for as equity in line with ias 
32 ‘financial instruments: presentation’, however are accrued on a straight-line basis and included as an expense within underlying profit before tax.revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured reliably.2  amortisation expense includes £32 million income (2016: £nil) in relation to the unwind of fair value adjustments recognised on acquisition of hrg, and a £6 million charge (2016: £10 million charge)  
in relation to the unwind of fair value adjustments recognised on acquisition of sainsbury’s bank.leased assets
leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the group.for property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.based on the operating performance of the cgus, an impairment of goodwill of £nil million was identified in the current financial year (2016: £nil million).under these agreements cash collateral is posted by one party 
to the other party should the fair value of the financial derivative exceed a pre-agreed level.the scheme continues to receive annual coupons from the property partnership which are based on the average weighted discount rate used in the triennial 
valuation and so are effectively reset every three years.the fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2017 2016
share price at grant date (pence) 231 243
exercise price (pence) 185 195
expected volatility – 3 year period (%) 29.9 26.6
 – 5 year period (%) 25.5 24.1
option life – 3 year period (years) 3.2 3.2
– 5 year period (years) 5.2 5.2
expected dividends (expressed as dividend yield %) 4.9 5.1
risk-free interest rate – 3 year period (%) 0.8 1.6
– 5 year period (%) 1.6 2.1
fair value per option – 3 year period (pence) 49 48
– 5 year period (pence) 45 45
the expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the 
period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.for the purposes of calculating adjusted net debt, the total value of the group’s capitalised operating lease commitments is £5,938 million (2016: £5,500 million).incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
