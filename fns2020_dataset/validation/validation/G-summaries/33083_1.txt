investment market
the weight of money in the retail property 
market has remained strong and, with 
the increased availability of debt, has 
heightened demand and resulted in 
downward pressure on yields.based on the gross portfolio 
value, the net initial yield ‘topped-up’ for the 
expiry of rent free periods was 4.60 per cent.the lease expiry cycle can bring risk to 
short-term earnings depending on the 
volume in a specific centre and when 
the expiries fall in the economic cycle, 
but it also provides the opportunity to 
introduce, reposition and right-size tenants, 
improving the tenant mix.the bonds had an 
average maturity of nine years and 
an all-in cost of 4.6 per cent
 — in april the group’s partnership with 
cppib signed a €95 million, five-year term 
loan secured on parque principado, spain

the acquisition of intu merry hill, intu 
derby and sprucefield.in addition, the group also collects v a t , 
employment taxes and withholding tax 
on dividends for hmrc and the spanish

paid by tenants, in respect of the group’s 
uk properties amounted to around 
£297 million in 2014.

our audit approach
overview
materiality — overall group materiality: £96 million which represents 1% of total assets.the group’s investment properties are all shopping centres and 
comprise the majority of the assets in the consolidated balance 
sheet, their carrying value amounting to £8.0bn.we confirmed that the 
valuation approach for each was in accordance with rics 
and suitable for use in determining the carrying value in the 
consolidated balance sheet.we found no evidence to suggest 
that the objectivity of any valuer in their performance of the 
valuations was compromised.the consideration paid was £854.9m.prior to migration, balances were mapped to 
the group’s own general ledger account lines, with adjustments 
made as required to ensure that the balances entering the 
system were in line with the group’s accounting policies.we focused on the fair value of the acquired 
properties, including the valuation methodology applied and the 
assumptions within the acquisition date valuation.we therefore performed first year audit 
procedures which focused on:
 — evaluation and testing of the controls over the transfer of 
accounting records onto the group’s general ledger and lease 
data onto the group’s lease system; and
 — assessment of adjustments posted during the transfer 
process in order to bring the numbers in line with the group’s 
accounting policies.accounts

interest income
interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method 
in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and their 
tax bases.valuations conform with the royal institution of chartered 
surveyors (‘rics’), valuation – professional standards 2014.
the main estimates and judgements underlying the valuations 
are described in note 19.
properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability.these determine the majority of 
the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation.the nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input 
assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property.accounts
