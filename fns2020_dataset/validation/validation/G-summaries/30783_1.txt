share capital structure
details of changes in the group’s share capital are
disclosed in note 20 of the consolidated ﬁnancial
statement.the directors are responsible for ensuring the
annual report and the ﬁnancial statements are
made available on a website.the ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial
statements is applicable law and international financial reporting standards (ifrss) as adopted by the
european union.to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.conclusions relating to going concern
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the isas (uk) require
us to report to you where:
•  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements is not appropriate; or
•  the directors have not disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements any identiﬁed material uncertainties that
may cast signiﬁcant doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the
ﬁnancial statements are authorised for issue.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our
audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identiﬁed, including those which had the
greatest eﬀect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the
eﬀorts of the engagement team.248225 alpha fx_pp34-pp42.qxp  03/04/2018  14:33  page 36 financial statements  independent auditor’s

assessing leases under ifrs 16 and expects an impact as the ‘right of use’ assets and corresponding
lease liabilities will come onto the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position for the ﬁrst time in
respect of its current operating leases.in accordance with ias 27, the group recognises any non-controlling interest at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets on a transaction by transaction basis.segment reporting
in accordance with ifrs 8 ‘operating segments’, an operating segment is deﬁned as a business activity
whose operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete
information is available.248225 alpha fx_pp43-pp59.qxp  03/04/2018  14:34  page 46 financial statements notes to the c onsolidated

2. accounting policies (continued)
financial assets at fair value through income statement
financial assets at fair value through income statement include ﬁnancial assets designated upon initial
recognition at fair value through income statement.subsequent changes in fair value are
recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.all ﬁnancial
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, carried at
amortised cost including directly attributable transaction costs.248225 alpha fx_pp43-pp59.qxp  03/04/2018  14:34  page 47 financial statements notes to the consolidated

2. accounting policies (continued)
credit valuation adjustment (“cva”) reﬂects the credit risk of the counterparties inherent in the valuation
of the derivative ﬁnancial instruments.in the process of applying
the group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements and estimates which
have the most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements:
estimates
impairment of ﬁnancial assets
impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence that the group will be unable to
collect all the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the
diﬀerence between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash ﬂows
associated with the impaired receivable.credit value adjustment
the credit value adjustment has been calculated by management based on the assumption that the
group will be unable to collect all the amounts due under the terms receivable, and therefore, is a
method of counterparty credit risk management.share-based payments
as described in note 2 (share-based payments), equity settled share awards are recognised as an
expense based on their fair value at date of grant.248225 alpha fx_pp43-pp59.qxp  03/04/2018  14:34  page 52 financial statements notes to the c onsolidated
