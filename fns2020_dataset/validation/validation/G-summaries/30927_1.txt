in the uk, the group 
outsources substantially all its haulage to 
two contractors.this decrease 
reflects the exceptional non-cash credit of 
£30.3 million in the prior year which arose 
on the closure of the uk defined benefit 
pension scheme and additional one-off 
non-cash finance costs (£6.4 million) 
which arose in h1 2017 when the group 
undertook a refinancing.sterling depreciated 
against the dollar in the year to 
31 december 2017 , the average exchange 
rate of $1.28:£1 was below that of the 
equivalent period in 2016 ($1.35:£1) and 
has resulted in a £0.5 million benefit to 
adjusted ebitda in 2017 .these 
non-cash interest charges, which were 
treated as exceptional, arose in the year 
in respect of accelerated debt issue fees 
(£3.3 million) and accounting adjustments 
caused by the prior year interest rate 
change (£3.1 million) – the latter equivalent 
to a non-cash gain from the prior year, 
which had been similarly presented as 
exceptional in the comparative 
disclosures.as announced on 11 october 2017 , wayne sheppard will retire 
from the board in 2018. wayne steered the company through its 
successful ipo and under his leadership ibstock has delivered 
significant shareholder value in its first years as a public listed 
company.it has been a pleasure to be ibstock’s chairman and i am proud of 
what the company has achieved since it listed in october 2015.

annual report and accounts 2017 74 ibstock plc personal objectives for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer for the 2017 financial year and the associated outcomes 
are outlined below:
name objective area notes
wayne sheppard business and vision (50%) – objectives relating to capital allocation projects were achieved.the remuneration committee determined that overall performance against these objectives was strong and equates to a 75% 
achievement for this element of the bonus (15% of maximum annual bonus opportunity).the vesting of the first award will be in 2019.
relative importance of spend on pay
the table below sets out the relative importance of spend on pay in the 2017 and 2016 financial years.in the event of a takeover or other change of control (usually 
excluding an internal reorganisation), outstanding awards under 
the group’s incentive plans vest and become exercisable 
(including adbp cash awards, adbp share awards and ltip 
awards), to the extent any performance conditions (if applicable) 
have been met, and subject to time pro-rating (if applicable) 
unless determined otherwise by the board in its discretion, in 
accordance with the rules of the plans.we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.the key audit matters identified in respect of 
rebates and pensions are the same as the 
prior year identified by the previous auditor 
(ernst & young llp).we confirm that we have nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.none of these is expected to have a 
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the 
group, except the following set out below:
ifrs 9, ‘financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, and a new credit loss model for calculating impairment 
to financial assets.notes to the group consolidated financial statements
annual report and accounts 2017 98 ibstock plc ifrs 16, ‘leases’ sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both 
parties to a contract, i.e.the lessee and the lessor.as well 
as a change to the line items in the income statement, it is also 
expected to change the profile of the net charge recognised in 
the income statement over the lease term.evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period 
between declaration of reserves and approval to extract clay as 
further work is undertaken in order to refine the development 
case to maximise the project’s returns.financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial 
assets held for trading.the group 
has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees 
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior 
periods.where defined benefit schemes have a surplus, the surplus is 
recognised if future economic benefits are available to the entity 
in the form of a reduction in the future contributions or a right to 
refund.provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the obligation.annual report and accounts 2017 106 ibstock plc 5. exceptional items

apply to those profits, the outcome of any future tax audits as well as the impact of changes in tax law.ibstock plc annual report and accounts 2017 115

being paid is significantly higher than the current market rents and vacant properties at acquisition.
