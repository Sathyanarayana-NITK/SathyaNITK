assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the group at their fair 
value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments.when some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be 
recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into level 1, 2 or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the 
significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement, which are described as follows:
• level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date
• level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
• level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 64
