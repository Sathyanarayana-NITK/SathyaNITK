i believe it is of paramount importance that we have the 
right skills set on the board to steer the group strategy for the 
long term.when i’m out in the 
business, i’m really pleased to see the pride our people take in 
their work, and in the legacy that we continue to build.ensuring the right people are in the right roles is 
critical to our future success and growth.the division is seeing a particular increase 
in transport opportunities with the hs2 joint venture award worth 
a combined £1.5bn, which will deliver revenue from 2018, and 
three new smart motorway projects covering design and survey 
work on the m20 and m23 and an additional project on the m6 as 
part of the collaborative delivery framework for highways england.both the infrastructure and international businesses 
saw a modest decline in volumes in the year, the former following 
delays in major public infrastructure procurement and the latter 
after the decision to concentrate this business in the middle east 
and close the caribbean and hong kong businesses.the 2017 board evaluation confirmed that the board is 
effective, with a strong mix of skills.› oversaw the simplification of the 
group’s portfolio to enable greater 
focus on its principal businesses.‘assessment of principal risks’ in 
‘accountability’ on page 72.
annual review of 
systems of risk 
management and 
internal control
during the 2017 financial year, the board 
monitored the group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control, via the rmac, 
and carried out a review of their effectiveness.the board has delegated certain of its responsibilities to the 
board committees.all directors have access to the services of the 
company secretary and may take independent professional advice 
at the expense of the company.the committee appointed korn ferry (which has no other connection with the company) to assist it in the process.inventory in these divisions is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value (i.e.pwc’s conclusion as to the presentation of the non-underlying items is set 
out in the independent auditor’s report on page 108. during the year, the board also obtained advice 
from the company’s corporate brokers with respect to such non-underlying items.the feedback was then reviewed 
by the committee at its meeting in december 2016. during the year, a new group head of risk and internal audit was appointed, to 
work alongside and manage kpmg with respect to the delivery of the internal audit plan.however, the committee 
discussed its preliminary views at its meeting in september 2017 and concluded that, overall, it remained satisfied with pwc’ s performance.external auditor independence and non-audit services
during the year, pwc provided certain non-audit services to the group.2018 – principal areas of focus
following the 2017 evaluation, the committee’s principal areas of 
focus for the 2018 financial year include:
 › maintaining a focus on key strategic issues, whilst challenging 
management with respect to operational issues; and
 › ensuring sufficient time is set aside to consider environmental 
and health and wellbeing matters.during the year, the 
committee oversaw the management of the prosecution brought 
against the bfk joint venture site following a fatality at the 
farringdon section of the crossrail project in march 2014 and two 
other incidents at the bond street section in january 2015, which 
resulted in a fine of £1.065m for the joint venture.examples of 
such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
 › a material misstatement of the group’s financial statements;
 › a material error in determining the level of satisfaction of a 
performance condition or target;
 › a participant deliberately misleading the company, the market 
and/or shareholders in relation to the financial performance of 
the group; and
 › a participant’s employment being terminated in circumstances 
of gross misconduct and/or circumstances justifying 
summary dismissal.the committee has the right to apply the malus provision to an 
individual or on a collective basis.these include, but are not limited to: the duration of the executive director’s service; 
the committee’s assessment of the executive director’s contribution to the success of the group; whether the executive director has 
worked any notice period or whether a pilon is being made; the need to ensure an orderly handover of duties; and the need to 
compromise any claims which the executive director may have.since 30 june 2017, the executive directors have acquired beneficial interests in ordinary shares in the capital of the company under 
the sip, as referred to on page 98.
