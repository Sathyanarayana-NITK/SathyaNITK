the velocys reactors and catalyst that are at the heart 
of the plant are performing at commercial scale in line 
with performance requirements.velocys and its 
engineering partner are continuing to work 
through the process of cost and value 
engineering to optimise plant capital cost, 
operating costs, carbon intensity and the 
total returns from the project.the partners
members of the partnership include:
british airways, the uk’s largest 
international airline, which intends to fly 
with the renewable jet fuel produced by 
the plant.impairment on assets and investments
for the impairment assessment the 
recoverable amount has been determined 
based on its fair value less costs of 
disposal (‘fair value’), by reference to 
the total value of the parent company’s 
equity, using the discounted share issue 
price at the january 2018 fundraise of 
10p per share.future funding 
the financial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis, 
which assumes the company will 
have sufficient funds available to 
enable it to continue to trade for the 
foreseeable future.as such, the company is 
careful to monitor the environmental 
impact of its operations.changes to the local demand for woody biomass or ability 
of the existing forestry industry infrastructure to transport 
rfs qualifying feedstock to the plant could increase the 
cost of supply or increase complexity by increasing the 
distance over which feedstock has to be sourced.the assessment 
is integrated in the overall project planning process and 
is monitored closely.the company believes that equity 
remains the preferred structure to support the 
business as a going concern in the near term, but 
will keep this under review.a performance evaluation 
of the chairman was carried out, led by 
the non-executive directors, and taking 
into account the views of all directors.directors
the directors of velocys plc who were in office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial statements, unless otherwise 
stated, were as follows.the directors have prepared financial forecasts to estimate the likely cash requirements of the 
company and velocys plc over the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.the directors anticipate that this will come from one, or a combination of, the following three 
sources, with agreements being actively sought from third parties:
 
strategic investment of development capital into the mississippi biorefinery project, which is expected during 2h 2018. the directors are confident that the funding required for the company and velocys plc to continue as a going concern will be secured 
within a period of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, and have therefore prepared the financial 
statements on a going concern basis.should additional funding not be secured within 
the 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements, the company and velocys plc would not be a going concern.the following chart illustrates the proportion of fixed and variable elements in the remuneration package, assuming target and 
stretch performance is achieved.the aggregate amount of these fees, as set out in the company’s 
annual report and accounts for the years ended 31 december 2017 and 2016 is as follows.in order to 
continue as a going concern the company and velocys plc need to secure additional external funding within 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements.the 
financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the company and velocys plc were unable to continue as a 
going concern.our audit focussed on assessing whether the financial 
instrument met the relevant criteria to be classified as an 
equity instrument.our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly , we do not express an audit opinion or , except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form 
of assurance thereon.in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

complexity, and areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are referenced in note 3.
