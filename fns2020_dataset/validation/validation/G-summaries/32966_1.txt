means that it is on track

company’s broader portfolio.at the same time, its technical 
focus ensures the company continues to mature 
the rest of the portfolio and its new venture 
strategy has successfully sought to capitalise 
on any further information gained from our 
near term drilling programme to add to our 
longer term prospect inventory.the very 
process of carrying out a dataroom and the 
potential partnering negotiations that follow 
provides the third party validation and technical 
de-risking that the company looks for to ensure 
that the potential of the asset is endorsed.with no remaining 
commitments across the portfolio we stand in a 
robust financial position from which we can look 
to technically mature our current assets and seek 
partners to enable the acceleration of drilling the

funding and liquidity as at 
31 december 2017
the group continues to have a robust balance 
sheet with no debt, cash of us$15.2 million as at 
31 december 2017 (31 december 2016: us$25.0 
million) and, following the drilling of the rabat 
deep 1 well in q1 2018 which chariot achieved 
at zero cost, no remaining commitments.the increase 
from us$6.2 million as at 31 december 2016 was 
primarily due to the award of the kenitra licence 
in 2017. in february 2018 us$4.0 million of 
moroccan bank guarantees were released.as at 31 december 2017, the group’s net 
balance of current trade and other receivables 
and current trade and other payables shows a 
net current liability position of us$1.0 million 
(31 december 2016: us$3.5 million) with the 
decrease primarily due to settlement in the 
current year of outstanding payables for the 
seismic campaigns in brazil and namibia.the first well in its drilling 
programme was completed at no cost to the 
company in rabat deep, morocco, in april 2018. 
whilst the rabat deep 1 well was unsuccessful, 
chariot’s operated neighbouring portfolio offers 
a variety of high impact drilling opportunities 
in the near term in other plays, which the team 
has continued to de-risk throughout the period 
through seismic acquisition and studies.new venture acquisitions
to capture this potential, chariot secured 
the kenitra permit in morocco in q1 2017, 
encompassing the broader lkp group of 
prospects and the kenitra prospect which now 
makes up part of the forward drilling campaign.this dataset is currently being interpreted and will 
be calibrated with the recent information from the 
drilling of the jp-1 prospect in rabat deep, to refine 
the lower cretaceous drilling targets kenitra-1  
and lkp-1a.partnering progress
in q1 2017 chariot completed the transfer of 
operatorship in rabat deep offshore morocco 
to eni in return for a carry on the drilling of 
the commitment well rabat deep 1 offering 
the company exposure to transformational 
potential at no financial risk.additionally, during the year, and as part of the 
withdrawal from the southern blocks (2714a 
and 2714b), chariot secured an option to back-
in for 10% equity at no cost after exploration 
drilling in return for which the company will 
assist with the farm-out process that will be led 
by namcor, the namibian state oil company 
on this acreage.strategic report governance financial statements

in morocco, the company holds acreage across 
three permit areas: rabat deep, mohammedia 
and kenitra, which are situated up to 50km 
offshore in northern morocco and cover a 
combined area of approximately 12,800km2.to allow for the completion of 
the interpretation of the 2017 seismic data 
and the incorporation of the results of the 
rabat deep 1 well, an updated partnering 
process on kenitra-1 and the lkp-1a prospect 
is anticipated to commence in mid-2018, with 
the aim of securing partners to contribute to 
the funding of kenitra-1 in h1 2019 (subject to 
partnering success).the group is subject to various risks including those which derive from the 
nature of its oil and gas exploration activities.in this role 
he had the responsibility to oversee a full cycle 
of exploration in a new country, including seismic 
acquisition, prospect generation and the execution 
of a deepwater drilling campaign.furthermore, it serves 
the purpose of demonstrating to shareholders that the remuneration of the executive directors for the group is set by a committee whose members 
have no personal interest in the outcome of their decision and who will have due regard to the interests of the shareholders.the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with ifrs as adopted by the european union.in our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 december, 2017 and of the group’s loss for the year then 
ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european union; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies (guernsey) law 2008.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (uk) (isas (uk)) and applicable law.we are independent of the 
group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the uk, including the frc’s ethical standard 
as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.key audit matter our response 32 chariot oil & gas limited | annual report and accounts 2017

group materiality us$1,800,000 (2016: us$3,000,000)
basis for determining materiality 2% of total assets 
group performance materiality us$1,170,000 (2016: us$1,950,000)
basis for performance materiality 65% of group materiality
we apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.performance materiality has been set at 65% of materiality, which is used to determine the financial statement areas that are included within 
the scope of our audit and the extent of sample sizes during the audit.the implementation of these standards 
and amendments is expected to have no material effect on the group’s accounting policies.deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates  
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.the residual value is the 
estimated amount that would currently be obtained from disposal of the asset if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the 
end of its useful life.the group includes its share of assets, liabilities and cash flows in joint arrangements, measured 
in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the group’s interest in the joint operations.the operating results of each of these segments are 
regularly reviewed by the board of directors in order to make decisions about the allocation of resources and assess their performance.details of the directors’ emoluments and interest in shares are shown in the directors’ 
remuneration report.(2)  on 27 march 2018 the company’s shareholders voted at a general meeting to authorise the deletion of article 3.1 of the company’s articles in its entirety to remove the concept of authorised 
share capital which is no longer a recognised concept under guernsey law.the directors have not disclosed the impact of interest 
rate sensitivity analysis on the group’s financial assets and liabilities at the year end as the risk is not deemed to be material.this transactional risk is managed by the group holding the majority of its funds in us dollars to recognise that us dollars is the trading currency of the 
industry, with an appropriate balance maintained in brazilian real, sterling and namibian dollars to meet other non-us dollar industry costs and ongoing 
corporate and overhead commitments.
