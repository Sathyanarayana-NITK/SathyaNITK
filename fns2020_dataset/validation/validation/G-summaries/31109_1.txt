the transformational reverse acquisition of ecuphar has created 
critical scale for the group within the european animal health 
market, providing a strengthened position to capitalise on growth 
in the market to deliver long-term shareholder value.more recently 
chris has taken responsibility for 
supporting the changes required 
within the supply chain function 
to provide a robust platform for 
growth and the integration of the 
ecuphar business into the group.the committee oversees the group’s and its subsidiaries’ internal 
financial controls and risk management systems, recommends the 
half and full year financial results to the board and monitors the 
integrity of all formal reports and announcements relating to the 
group’s financial performance.duties
the main duties of the committee are set out in its terms 
of reference which are available on the company’s website 
(www.animalcaregroup.co.uk) and include the following key 
responsibilities:
nomination
 {
leading the process for all potential appointments to the board 
and making recommendations to the board in relation to 
potential appointments; 
 { evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge on the board; and
 { in the light of any evaluation, prepare a description of the role 
and capabilities required for a particular appointment.the 
hurdle was determined by the remuneration committee and 
broadly represented a 20% premium to the company’s market 
capitalisation on 27
th
 june 2014. each holder of a shares would, on 
a sale of his entire holding to the company, be entitled to receive 
ordinary shares representing a percentage of the increase in the 
company’s market capitalisation above the hurdle; being 5% for 
iain menneer and 3% for chris brewster.the directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.{ we, as the group engagement team, audited the two components based in the uk - being 
animalcare group plc and animalcare limited.these matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.we, as the group engagement team, performed an audit of the complete financial information for the two uk components – animalcare 
group plc and animalcare limited.we, as the group engagement team, were also responsible for other head office activities such as the 
purchase price allocation in relation to the reverse acquisition of ecuphar and the financial statement disclosures.the directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.the consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands 
of pound sterling (£k or thousands of £) and all “currency” 
values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000), except when 
otherwise indicated.this policy reflects the commercial substance of this transaction  
as follows:
 { the original shareholders of the legal subsidiary undertaking 
were the most significant shareholders following admission to 
aim, owning 46.9% of the issued share capital; 
 { the assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary ecuphar nv are 
recognised and measured in the group financial statements at 
the pre-combination carrying amounts without restatement to 
fair value;
 { the retained earnings and other equity balances recognised 
in the group financial statements reflect the retained earnings 
and other equity balances of ecuphar nv immediately before 
the business combination
 { the results of the period from 1
st
 january 2017 to the date of 
the business combination are those of ecuphar nv;
 { the equity structure appearing in the group financial 
statements reflects the equity structure of the legal parent, 
including the equity instruments issued under the share-
for-share exchange to effect the business combination and 
adjusted in accordance with ifrs 3. this results in the creation 
of a “reverse acquisition reserve” as at 1
st
 january 2017, being 
the difference between the company equity structure and that 
of ecuphar nv.the consolidated financial statements cover the year ended 
31
st
 december 2017. the financial statements for the comparative 
year ended 31
st
 december 2016 represent the substance of the 
reverse acquisition and are those of ecuphar nv.the functional currency 
of most subsidiaries of the group is euros.such 
cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to construction 
projects if the asset necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for its intended use, it is probable that they will result in 
future economic benefits to the group and the cost can be measured 
reliably.gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.post-employment benefits
the group has a defined contribution obligation where the group 
pays contributions based on salaries to an insurance company, in 
accordance with the laws and agreements in each country.in general, these services are invoiced as they are performed and 
the amounts directly recognised in the income statement and do 
not require the measurement of the stage of completion.deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.the fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the 
principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability.notes to the consolidated
