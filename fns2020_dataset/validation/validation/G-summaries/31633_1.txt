remain important priorities for the group, followed 
by financial management given the new cfo and 
proposed change of external auditor.so far the initiative has helped the 
continued development of many departments 
across the business.the 
policy also establishes guidelines for the recruitment 
of employees or former employees of the external 
auditor.the breakdown of the fees paid to the external 
auditor, including the split between audit and 
non-audit is included in note 5 on page 101 of the 
financial statements.internal control
the committee regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of the group’s system of internal controls and risk 
management.this involves the monitoring and review 
of the effectiveness of internal audit activities, which 
included a review of the audits carried out and the 
results thereof, the management response and the 
programme and resourcing for 2017 and 2018. the 
committee believes it is appropriate that the internal 
audit process is undertaken by members of the 
finance team who conduct financial reviews of the 
sites on a rotational basis.remuneration report
letter from the chair of the 
remuneration committee
on behalf of the board, i am pleased to present the 
directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 
30 september 2017. 
the remuneration report is split into three sections:
• this annual statement summarising the work of 
the remuneration committee in 2017
• the directors’ remuneration policy (the ‘policy’) 
as approved at the 2016 agm
• the annual report on remuneration, which 
provides details of the remuneration earned by 
directors in the year ended 30 september 2017 
under the policy.this will be the subject of an 
advisory vote at the forthcoming agm
2017 performance
as set out in the strategic report, the results for 
the year ended 30 september 2017 reflect another 
strong performance, confirming the progress 
the group has made over the past 12 months 
in delivering growth.remuneration committee  
activities in 2017
the key decisions made by the remuneration 
committee (‘the committee’) in respect of 2017 
remuneration were as follows:
board changes
in a year of change at board level, the committee 
oversaw the negotiation of and approved all 
packages paid to current and former executive 
directors as follows: 
• following eight successful years as group 
finance director and as announced to 
shareholders on 18 october 2016, andrew 
lewis stood down as group finance director on 
30 november 2016. it was agreed that a short 
period of handover would be helpful and andrew 
remained an employee of the group, receiving 
his salary, pension and other contractual benefits 
until 16 december 2016. full details of the terms 
agreed in connection with mr lewis’s departure 
are disclosed in the remuneration report
• the board retained the services of paul 
rayner, an experienced listed company finance 
director, on an interim basis while the search 
for a permanent successor for mr lewis was 
conducted.the remuneration agreed for mr 
rayner was specific to the interim nature of his 
appointment and details of the remuneration 
paid are set out on page 67
• rob rennie stepped down as chief executive 
officer on 15 february 2017 to pursue other 
interests.both will be considered for increases 
to the median level on the anniversary of their 
appointment.full details of the agreed packages 
are set out in the remuneration report

shareholder informations financial statements strategic report governance overview non-executive director pay
• under the policy, the fees of non-executive 
directors are reviewed and benchmarked every 
three years, with increases only implemented if 
current fees are found to be below the median of 
a comparator group.the review, which was conducted by the board 
chairman and the executive directors for the non-
executive directors, excluding the chairman, and 
by the remuneration committee for the chairman, 
concluded that as current fees remained close to 
the median of the comparator group, no increases 
would be made for the 2018 financial year
performance related pay
• the bonus outcomes for the executive directors 
were determined by reference to performance 
against the agreed financial business targets, 
as well as the committee’s assessment of their 
individual performance and delivery of personal 
objectives.the company’s financial performance 
for the year, together with the assessment of 
individual performance and contribution, resulted 
in bonus awards for the executive directors at 
81% of maximum for paul mcdonald and 83% 
of maximum for nick keveth.mr mcdonald also 
received a bonus payment relating to the first 
half of the financial year when he was managing 
director of the dairy division.this was calculated 
using slightly different financial performance 
metrics which are explained on page 68. this 
element of paul mcdonald’s bonus payment has 
not been included in the above percentage figure 
which relates only to the period while he was 
appointed chief executive officer
• vesting of the 2010 performance share plan (‘psp’) 
took place in december 2016, based on the agreed 
measures of relative total shareholder return 
(‘tsr’) and earnings per share (‘eps’) growth over 
the three years to 30 september 2016. the overall 
vesting level achieved for these awards was 100%
• the committee also considered the impact of 
the restatement of the 2016 income statement 
on payments made under the annual bonus 
scheme and the vesting of awards made under 
the performance share plan in previous years.the definition of profit before interest, tax and 
exceptionals (‘pbite’) used in the calculation of 
the annual bonus explicitly excludes the charge 
for the share based payment so the calculation 
error did not impact the achievement of the 
pbite bonus objectives in previous years.the 
definition of eps in the performance condition 
for psp purposes does not exclude this charge, 
however, given the extent of overachievement 
against the maximum vesting target, the inclusion 
of the revised charge would not have impacted 
the vesting level of awards in december 2015 or 
december 2016
policy
the directors’ remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders at the agm on 26 january 2016 and 
will remain in effect until the 2019 agm.following a 
review of feedback received from shareholders, the 
committee decided to limit the maximum bonus for 
executive directors for the 2017 financial year to 
100% of salary by removing the 50% element for eps 
growth in excess of 20% of prior year.link between remuneration  
and company strategy
the committee seeks to support the delivery of the 
group’s strategy through establishing appropriate 
remuneration arrangements.the remuneration 
policy is designed to align the executive directors’ 
interests with those of shareholders, and to 
incentivise the executive directors to meet the 
company’s financial and strategic objectives by 
making a significant proportion of remuneration 
performance-related.the group’s financial and 
strategic objectives are set out in the strategic 
report on pages 10 to 39. the committee reviews 
the application of the policy regularly to ensure 
it remains appropriate and it expires next year 
after three years.in particular, i will be reviewing the annual 
bonus scheme with the intention of proposing an 
updated scheme as part of the next version of the 
remuneration policy.remuneration report continued
communication with shareholders
i welcome all shareholder feedback on this report.remuneration committee
the remuneration committee is responsible for 
developing and implementing remuneration policy 
and for determining the executive directors’ 
individual packages and terms of service together 
with those of the other members of the group 
executive management team.guiding policy
the remuneration committee’s terms of reference 
are available on the company’s website and include:
• determining and agreeing with the board the 
policy for the remuneration of the company’s 
chief executive officer, chief financial 
officer, chairman, the company secretary 
and such other members of the senior 
management team as it chooses to consider or 
is designated to consider (currently the group 
executive management team), having regard to 
remuneration trends across the group
• within the terms of the agreed policy, determining 
the total individual remuneration package of each 
executive director including, where appropriate, 
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and 
pension arrangements.the remuneration of non- 
executive directors is a matter for the chairman 
and the executive directors
• determining the targets for the performance 
related bonus schemes for the executive directors 
and the group executive management team
• reviewing the design of all share incentive plans 
for approval by the board and shareholders.for any such discretionary plans, determining 
each year whether awards will be made, the 
overall amount of such awards, the individual 
awards to executive directors and the group 
executive management team (and others) and  
the performance targets to be used
• agreeing termination arrangements for 
senior executives
the committee aims to provide a remuneration 
structure that supports the achievement of the 
company’s performance objectives and, in turn, 
increases shareholder value.the company’s guiding policy on executive 
remuneration is that:
• executive remuneration packages should 
take into account the linkage between pay 
and performance by both rewarding effective 
management and by making the enhancement 
of shareholder value a critical success factor in 
the setting of incentives, both in the short and 
the long-term
• the overall level of salary, incentives, pension 
and other benefits should be competitive when 
compared with other companies of a similar size 
and global spread to attract, retain and motivate 
executive directors of superior calibre in order 
to deliver continued growth of the business
• performance related components should form a 
significant proportion of the overall remuneration 
package, with maximum total potential rewards 
being earned through the achievement of 
challenging performance targets based on 
measures that represent the best interests 
of shareholders

shareholder informations financial statements strategic report governance overview approach to recruitment remuneration
the committee’s policy on recruitment remuneration is that 
new executive directors will be offered a base salary below 
the median level in the applicable benchmarking report 
until proven, at which point they will receive an uplift to the 
benchmark median salary level determined and maintained by 
reference to independent benchmarking studies carried out 
every three years.annual bonus awards, performance share 
plan awards and pension contributions would not be in excess 
of the current levels stated for the chief executive officer 
and the chief financial officer.this is the approach that has 
been followed in setting the remuneration package for the new 
chief executive officer and chief financial officer.the committee 
might consider paying up to 2.5 times base salary in these 
circumstances with the actual amount being defined by 
market requirements at the time.the company has not paid any joining 
incentives in connection with recruitment of new directors 
under the current remuneration policy.consideration of conditions  
elsewhere in the company
the experience of committee members and an independent 
experts’ benchmarking report have been relied upon in setting 
the remuneration packages for the executive directors and 
this remuneration policy.in line with other small to mid-sized 
companies there is no works council and therefore there is no 
established process or platform to consult employees in relation 
to executive remuneration, although the committee has regard 
to the general terms and conditions of employment within the 
company.consistent with this approach, annual cost of living 
increases granted to the wider workforce are not paid to the 
executive directors or to the other members of the group 
executive management team.the company does hold an annual 
employee opinion survey and the committee is kept informed 
of pay and conditions applying to the general population across 
the group.the committee monitors the remuneration of the wider 
workforce and, in particular, the divisional management teams 
as well as other key employees.annual report and accounts 2017
avon rubber p.l.c.under the plan, executive directors and a limited number of other senior executives and employees receive conditional share 
awards (which may be in the form of nil-cost options) in respect of the company’s shares.this range was first introduced for the awards made in december 2011 and remains appropriate, but the committee  
will keep it under review and will include it as part of its review of all aspects of executive remuneration during 2018.
for all psp awards from 1 october 2015, the committee amended the calculation of the eps performance condition to  
cpi instead of rpi.annual report and accounts 2017

avon rubber p.l.c.recognising mr lewis’s contribution to the company’s success over a period of eight years, the committee exercised its 
discretion in accordance with the directors’ remuneration policy to determine that mr lewis was permitted to retain his 2015 
and 2016 psp awards on a good leaver basis, pro-rated for service by one third and two thirds respectively.there are no 
restrictions on the transfer of issued shares or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except where the company 
has suspended their voting rights or prohibited their transfer following a failure to respond to a notice to shareholders under 
section 793 of the companies act 2006, or where the holder is precluded from transferring or voting by the financial services 
authority’s listing rules or the city code on takeovers and mergers.the company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a change of control, except in relation to the performance share plan as described above.the board is satisfied that david evans, pim vervaat and chloe ponsonby are independent non-executive directors.we used tax specialist to assess the adequacy of the level of provision 
established in relation to a number of uncertain taxation positions primarily in 
respect of risks in the us.risk of fraud in revenue recognition (group)

realistic alternative but to do so.(ca06)
the directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 46 of the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.the chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the group executive team.it recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if 
any, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.the profit or loss on the transaction is 
recognised immediately and lease payments charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.provisions
provisions are recognised when:
• the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a  
result of a past event
• it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount has 
been reliably estimated
where there are a number of similar obligations, for example 
where a warranty has been given, the likelihood that an outflow 
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole.annual report and accounts 2017
