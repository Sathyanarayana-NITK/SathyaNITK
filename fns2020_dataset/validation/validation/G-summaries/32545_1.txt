sensitivity anal ysis
below is the sensitivity analysis determined for significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of defined benefit 
obligations and based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of reporting y ear while 
holding all other assumptions constant.the estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which 
point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations.the interest expensed on the liability component is calculated by applying an effective interest rate.as at 31 march 2017 , the outstanding amount under this facility is us$379.1 
million.during the previous year, the company bought back us$7 .0 million 6.75% bonds due june 2016 from the open market and 
further during the current year us$62.6 million was bought back.
