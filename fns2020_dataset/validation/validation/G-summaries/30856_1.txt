in addition the funding position in 2017 benefited 
from the strong cash collection in slovakia and lithuania.the head of internal audit 
reports directly to the chairman of the audit and risk committee.assisted by the technology 
committee, chaired by john mangelaars, the board continued to 
support the drive to increase ipf’s technology-based capabilities in 
line with its broadening product range and channel choices.all board appointments are 
made on merit, in the context of the skills and experience the board 
as a whole requires in order to be effective.composition
the committee comprises three independent non-executive 
directors and is chaired by richard moat, a fellow of the association 
of chartered certified accountants, who has relevant and recent 
experience for the purposes of the uk corporate governance code 
(the ‘code’).the areas covered by these in 2017 are referred to in the 
‘training’ section on page 57. the internal controls in relation to the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are outlined 
on page 85.
in particular, during 2017 the committee monitored legal and 
regulatory compliance and tax issues.in addition, the committee 
received reports from the external auditor setting out its view on the 
accounting treatments and judgements underpinning the financial 
statements.review of the effectiveness of the systems of 
internal control
on behalf of the board, the committee has monitored the group’s 
systems of internal control and its processes for managing principal 
risks throughout 2017 and performed an assessment of their 
effectiveness.these processes for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced by the group were in place 
throughout 2017 and up to 1 march 2018.
annual report and financial statements
the committee has reviewed and considered the annual report  
and financial statements, in line with other information the 
committee has considered throughout the course of the year.the committee met regularly throughout the year to oversee the 
implementation of the revised strategy and to monitor progress 
against each of its four key pillars.25% of the award vests at 
threshold performance in respect 
of the performance conditions, 
with straight-line vesting 
to maximum.the day-to-day running of the business is delegated to the 
executive committee.understanding 
at first-hand from those on the ground has never been more 
important than in 2017 when, together with the rest of the board, 
i visited poland and spent two full days both being briefed and 
in turn constructively challenging the management teams from 
our home credit and ipf digital businesses.for example, our 
articles contain specific provisions and restrictions regarding ipf’s 
powers to borrow money; provisions relating to the appointment of 
directors, subject to subsequent shareholder approval; delegation of 
powers to a director or committees; and, subject to certain 
exceptions, a director shall not vote on or be counted in a quorum in 
relation to any resolution of the board in respect of any contract in 
which he/she has an interest which he/she knows is material.directors’ conflicts of interest
to take account of the companies act 2006, the directors adopted 
a policy on conflicts of interest and established a register of conflicts.a summary of those rights and obligations can be 
found below.the financial statements, which are agreed directly to the 
consolidation of the group results, are prepared by the group 
reporting team and reviewed by the group head of finance and  
the chief financial officer.the financial statements and all supporting notes are 
reviewed and approved by the chief financial officer and they are 
signed by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer.report on environment, social and governance 
(‘esg’) matters
the board takes regular account of the significance of esg matters 
to the group and has identified and assessed the significance of 
esg risks to the company’s short and long-term value as part of the 
risk management process.we also confirmed that the revenue recognition 
policies applied to the material loan types offered by 
the group were appropriate in accordance with ias 
18 revenue and applicable accounting standards.international personal finance plc annual report and financial statements 2017 95

page 137. 
the principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries (the group) and the nature of the group’s operations are set out i n the strategic 
report on page 4. 
these financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
group operates.foreign operations are set out in accordance with the policies set out on page 104.

(‘ifrss’), international financial reporting interpretations committee (‘ifric’) interpretations and the companies act 2006 app licable to 
companies reporting under ifrs.further detail is contained in the financial review on page 35. 
basis of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and the entities controlled by the co mpany 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 december each year.the group is domiciled in the uk and no revenue is generated in the uk.a further £13.2 million (2016: £12.5 million) has been added to the cost of investment representing the fair value of the share-
based payment awards over ipf plc shares made to employees of su bsidiary companies of ipf plc.as outlined in the financial review on page 35, the group’s home credit company in poland, provident polska, has been subject t o tax 
audits in respect of the company’s 2008 an d 2009 financial years.the purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the group’s underlying busines s operations.the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equit y of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates  
for the countries in which the group operates: 
group 
2017

change in reserves  6.8 4.7
change in profit before taxation  8.6 6.4
this sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: 
• there is a 5% strengthening/weakening of sterling against all currencies in which the group operates (polish zloty, czech crown , euro, 
hungarian forint, mexican peso, romanian leu, and australian dollar); and 
• there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly 
equal to the currency liability).scheme assets are stated at fair value as at 31 december 2017. the major assumptions used by the actuary were:

%
price inflation (‘cpi’)  2.1 2.4
rate of increase to pensions in payment  2.9 3.2
discount rate  2.6 2.7
the expected return on scheme assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the c urrent 
investment policy.the 
income statement charge in respect of this scheme is calculated using the share price at the date of grant.
