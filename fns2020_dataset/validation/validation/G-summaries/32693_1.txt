risk analysis during the year
2016/17 risk and control assessments
ferguson formally reviews its principal group and business unit risks 
every six months – at the half-year and at the year-end.since the large majority of the group’s proﬁt is derived from activities 
outside of the uk and europe, the group does not, at this point in time, 
envisage a material adverse impact in the future.the programmes were tailored 
to ensure that they could familiarise themselves with the business, and the 
markets in which it operates, from the ground up.the board is satisﬁed each non executive director continues 
to demonstrate independence of thought and expertise in meetings, 
and to support the senior management in an objective manner.during the year, the non executive directors, led by the senior 
independent director, undertook the performance evaluation of the 
chairman.areas identiﬁed in order to improve overall effectiveness, are 
summarised below:
actions
develop further opportunities for the board to meet with usa 
management and further their understanding of the group’s usa 
operations and market environment
continue to focus on succession planning at board and executive level
as at the date of this report, the board has already begun to incorporate 
these action points into its processes and procedures.the group director of communications and investor relations regularly 
provides the board with details of feedback received from institutional 
shareholders and any key issues raised.further details of 
the committee’s activities during the year are set out opposite.completeness of 
supplier rebates 
(recurring item)
audit committee review
the committee reviewed the recognition of supplier rebates which are signiﬁcant to the 
group and are an area of inherent risk due to the number and complexity of the arrangements.the review concluded that the committee was well run 
and that, overall, committee members were satisﬁed with the quality 
of the succession planning process for board and executive positions.all directors have a continuing 
duty to update any changes.restrictions on transfer of shares
there are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the company’s 
ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in the company.his appointment on a salary of 
$900,000 is below the market median (and below his predecessor’s salary) 
and as with the group cfo, provides room to increase his salary by more 
than the average salary increase for the relevant general workforce, subject 
to his performance in the role, in both august 2018 and 2019 to move him 
closer to the market median, consistent with our policy.**  adjusted to remove the beneﬁt to management of currency movements during 
2016/17 and to include the nordic business as detailed in the committee chair’s 
statement, opposite.bonus payments are not included in the calculation of the 
company pension contributions.the tsr measure is considered appropriate as it ensures that the interests 
of the executive directors are closely aligned with those of the company’s 
shareholders over the long term and incentivises outperformance of 
the company relative to its peers.eps growth

1.  headline eps as presented in the audited ferguson plc annual report and accounts 
(subject to such adjustments as the committee deems appropriate to ensure it reﬂects 
underlying business performance).the committee 
is satisﬁed that the services provided to it by freshﬁelds are of a technical 
nature and did not create any conﬂict of interest and therefore the advice 
received from them was objective and independent.due to 
these unusual circumstances and in line with the approved remuneration 
policy, the committee agreed it was appropriate to broadly replicate the 
structure and fair value of unvested long-term incentive awards forfeited 
by mr powell as a result of joining ferguson and approved the grant of 
three restricted share buy out awards (rsbo) to replace awards forfeited 
under the bba deferred share plan and one performance based buy out 
award (pbbo) to replace awards forfeited under the bba ltip .dividend equivalents 
also accrue on the ltip and pbbo awards and the amount which may be due to an executive director is not included in the calculation of face value.if an executive director ceases to be an employee 
for any other reason, an award shall vest in full at the end of the deferral 
period unless the reason for cessation is death or other circumstances 
which the committee considers sufficiently exceptional, the award shall 
vest in full at the date of death or cessation of employment.furthermore, the board has also applied the principles 
of good governance relating to directors’ remuneration contained 
within the uk corporate governance code updated in april 2016. 
the remuneration committee conﬁrms that throughout the ﬁnancial 
year the company has complied with these governance rules and best 
practice provisions.in order to avoid any conﬂicts of interest, all such 
appointments are subject to the approval of the nominations committee.during the year, and until his retirement 
as group ceo on 31 august 2016, mr meakins also served as a non 
executive director of rexel sa.the number of 
shares held by the trusts represented 0.54 per cent of the company’s 
issued share capital at 31 july 2017.
on 7 november 2016, shares were purchased by the us trust to 
ensure that it continues to have sufficient shares to satisfy share awards.consolidation
the consolidated ﬁnancial information includes the results of the 
parent company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiary 
undertakings and controlling interests) and its share of the results of 
its associate drawn up to 31 july 2017.
the trading results of business operations are included in proﬁt from 
continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale.rebates relating to 
the purchase of goods for resale are accrued as earned and are recorded 
initially as a deduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of 
sales when the related product is sold.the following tables present the group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 july 2017 and 31 july 2016:
