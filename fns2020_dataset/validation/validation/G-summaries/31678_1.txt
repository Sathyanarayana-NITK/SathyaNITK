we will continue to grow 
fresh property group by:
• offering end-to-end 
solutions, so institutional 
investors engage us to 
manage the pbsa and 
build to rent assets the 
group develops; and
• winning the management 
of new and existing 
assets developed by 
third parties.definition
the number of student beds and build to 
rent units that fresh property group is 
contracted to manage on behalf of our 
institutional clients.all ten of the 
developments for completion in fy18, 
ahead of the 2018/19 academic year, 
have been forward sold.the gross margin for 
the student accommodation development 
business increased to 22.1% from 20.5% 
in fy16.in fy16, the 
calculation of earnings per share was 
affected by the change in the number of 
shares in issue as a result of the ipo.the group’s investment in joint ventures 
was reduced by £4.1 million as a result of 
the disposal of athena hall (jersey) 
limited.we utilised the rcf to assist with 
several site acquisitions during the year and 
to fund the build of the hotel and offices at 
christchurch road, bournemouth.• construction and delivery • the group’s specialism and experience in building pbsa helps the accurate estimation of 
development costs.a failure to attract, recruit and retain the 
right personnel for the business could 
restrict its ability to grow and could result 
in development margins being eroded, 
through the use of personnel without the 
requisite skills, experience and knowledge.• construction and delivery • the group has rigorous health and safety policies and procedures in place, which are managed 
by an established health and safety department which regularly conducts health and safety audits 
across all the group’s sites.the group has suitable governance 
structures in place and we have continued 
to develop and embed the processes and 
procedures that support our governance 
framework.this ensures that the board 
and the business can operate effectively, 
while protecting the group’s 
entrepreneurial culture.all directors have access to the advice 
and services of the chief financial officer, 
who ensures that the board’s procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with, and to the 
professional company secretarial services

watkin jones plc  //  annual report and financial statements 2017 43 dear shareholder
on behalf of the audit committee, i am pleased to present the audit committee report for 
the year ended 30 september 2017. the board is satisfied that i have the necessary recent 
and relevant financial experience to chair the audit committee.it is no longer 
the policy of the company to enter into 
arrangements of this nature;
• bonus accrual.our audit procedures included:
• evaluating the design and implementation 
of controls over revenue recognition; and 
• we performed audit procedures designed 
to address the risk of management override 
of controls including journal entry testing to 
confirm the processing and timing of 
journals to record revenue are consistent 
with our expectations.we conclude that the inputs and 
assumptions applied are reasonable and 
that the carrying value of land and work in 
progress at 30 september 2017 is 
appropriate.goodwill is initially measured at cost 
being the excess of the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed.if the reassessment still results in an 
excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised 
immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.accordingly, the financial 
statements and the comparatives have 
been prepared on this basis.sales of property under development
where a contract is judged to be for the 
construction of a property and the legal 
terms of the contract are such that the 
construction represents the continuous 
transfer of work in progress to the 
purchaser, the percentage of completion 
method of revenue recognition is applied 
and revenue is recognised as work 
progresses.during the vesting 
period a liability is recognised representing 
the product of the cost of the reward and 
the portion of the vesting period expired at 
the balance sheet date.the fair value measurement is based 
on the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
• in the principal market for the asset or 
liability; or
• in the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.judgements
in the process of applying the group’s 
accounting policies, management has 
made the following judgement, which has 
the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements: 
sale and operating  
leaseback of properties
the accounting treatment of the sale and 
leaseback depends upon the substance of 
the transaction (applying the lease 
classification principles described in note 
3.20).the build to rent segment has been introduced for the first time in fy17.there is no difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share as there are no dilutive share option arrangements 
in place at 30 september 2017.
the following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted eps computations:
      year ended year ended  
      30 september 30 september  
      2017 2016  
      £’000 £’000
profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent    35,800  4,207
profit from continuing operations attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent   35,800 5,085
adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent  
(excluding exceptional ipo costs)      35,800  31,646
      number of shares number of shares
number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share     255,268,875 134,729,152
      pence pence
basic earnings per share from continuing operations
basic profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent   14.024  3.774
adjusted proforma basic earnings per share from continuing operations 
(excluding exceptional ipo costs) 
basic profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent   14.024  23.489
using the number of shares in issue at 30 september 2016, the adjusted proforma basic earnings per share from continuing operations for 
the year ended 30 september 2016 would have been 12.397 pence.the following are the key assumptions used in projecting the cash flows:
• contracted management agreements in place are renewed in line with past experience;
• new management agreements are secured to deliver the budgeted beds under management for the cgu for the five-year period ending 
30 september 2022. thereafter management agreements are secured to manage an additional 1,000 student beds per annum.the resulting goodwill of £9,744,000 arising on the acquisition has been capitalised and is subject to an annual impairment review by 
management.the amount of the provision has been calculated by comparing the expected future rent liabilities 
for the remaining term of the leases with the expected net income from the operations of the properties concerned, excluding future 
maintenance costs.therefore the group has assessed the following risks:
market risk
market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of 
financial position is the carrying amounts of cash at bank and in hand.the directors consider the management of 
debt to be an important element in controlling the capital structure of the group.
