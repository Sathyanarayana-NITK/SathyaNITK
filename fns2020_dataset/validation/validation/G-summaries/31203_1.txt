risk/definition mitigation change 
in 2017
explanation
liquidity
the group may not be able to meet 
its financial obligations because it:
• is unable to borrow to fund 
lending by its operating 
businesses
• has failed to renew/replace 
existing debt facilities as they 
become payable
• cannot fund growth and  
further acquisitions
• the group’s short-term loans to customers 
provide a natural hedge against medium-term 
borrowings
• the group successfully refinanced all of its 
bank facilities in august 2017 and raised 
additional long-term debt funding from a 
range of different providers
• the new £225m loan facility is for six years and 
is supplemented by a £35m revolving credit 
facility
• cash and covenant forecasting is conducted 
on a monthly basis as part of the regular 
management reporting exercise
with net debt of c.£197m and total debt facilities 
of £260m at 31 december 2017 , the group has 
sufficient headroom on its existing facilities to 
fund the group’s growth plans in 2018.
reputational
lending money at high rates of 
interest means that consumer finance 
can attract a higher level of media 
and political scrutiny than certain 
other business sectors.• as a plc listed on the main market of the 
london stock exchange, the group is highly 
transparent with full disclosure regarding its 
business and financial performance 
• the group conducts an active regulatory 
affairs programme to ensure that all 
stakeholders, not just the providers of capital, 
have an accurate picture of what the group is 
trying to achieve, our ethos, culture and 
business strategy 
• whilst a relatively new company we have 
embarked upon a group-wide exercise to 
ensure that ‘what we say is what we do’ and 
that our processes and procedures are 
consistent with our desired culture, values and 
behaviours (see culture and stakeholder 
management on pages 50 to 53) 
we continue to engage actively with all of our 
key stakeholders, including the fca, members of 
parliament, debt-related charities, other 
regulators, journalists, think-tanks, investors and 
debt-providers.non-standard finance plc annual report 2017 40
normalised revenue was £119.8m (2016: 
£81.1m) reflecting just over four months’ 
contribution from george banco that was 
acquired on 17 august 2017 and a full 
period of everyday loans (including 
trusttwo).as a result, the division 
reached record volumes in november and december 2017 and risk 
adjusted margin was over 30%.the prior 
year exceptional charge of £0.6m related to stamp duty paid on the 
acquisition of everyday loans.the gap in our mean figure relating to

has a greater proportion of male 
employees.external appointments
