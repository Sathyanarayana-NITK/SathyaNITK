capital structure
group board focus on a strong and flexible 
capital structure, which can adapt to market 
conditions, and reducing and diversifying the 
cost of funding.the directors also 
have regular dialogue with, and direct 
access to, the advice and services of 
the company secretary, who ensures 
that board processes and corporate 
governance practices are followed.as part of the induction programme, 
each director also visits key locations to 
see our business operations and properties 
first-hand and the higher education 
institutions with which we partner.maintaining reit status 
involves significant judgement about the 
future performance of the business and 
compliance with the reit rules and there 
would be a material impact on the group’s 
tax charge and financial results of not 
remaining compliant with the reit regime.the 
committee also discussed and challenged 
the output from the internal audit reviews 
undertaken in the prior year and concluded 
that the reviews provided good support for 
statements made by management and 
that the control environment is robust in 
the areas tested over the last three years.our remuneration 
policy, detailed on pages 79 to 85, 
remains consistent with that approved by 
shareholders at the last binding vote at the 
2016 agm, and is reproduced in full for both 
ease of reference and in order to provide 
context to the decisions taken by the 
committee during the year.fixed pay 
levels are competitive but not excessive 
when taking into account similar roles 
at comparable companies, individual 
contributions, experience and overall 
levels of responsibility.in addition to the above, the remuneration 
policy for the executive directors and 
other senior executives is based on the 
following key principles:
 - a significant proportion of 
remuneration should be tied to the 
achievement of specific and stretching 
performance conditions that align 
remuneration with the creation of 
shareholder value and the delivery 
of the group’s strategic plans
 - there should be a focus on sustained 
long-term performance, with 
performance measured over clearly 
specified timescales, encouraging 
executives to take action in line with 
the group’s strategic plan, using good 
business management principles and 
taking well-considered risks
 - individuals should be rewarded for 
success, but steps should be taken, 
within contractual obligations, to 
prevent rewards for failure.executive directors receive a pension contribution 
of 20% of salary or an equivalent cash allowance.the corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a 
sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which ‘on target’ performance by the group results in a 
corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary.change of control
all of the company’s share schemes 
contain provisions relating to a change 
of control.directors’ conflicts of interest
the company has procedures in 
place for managing conflicts of interest.each of the directors, the name of whom 
are set out on pages 56 and 57 , confirms 
that to the best of his or her knowledge:
 - the annual report and accounts 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the company’s position and 
performance, business model 
and strategy
 - the financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit and loss 
of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole
 - the directors’ report includes a 
fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.key observations we are satisfied with the approach and methodology adopted in valuing the property 
portfolio and consider the valuations to be suitable for inclusion in the financial statements at
