which has been prepared in accordance with aim rule 19. 
membership of board committees
in the course of this first year since the 
company’s admission to aim, the board 
has agreed that all non-executives 
should participate in the audit, risk 
& compliance, nominations and 
disclosure committees in order 
to gain a full appreciation and 
understanding of the company.it monitors the exposure to key 
business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the business.the search for candidates was 
conducted, and appointments made, 
on merit, using objective criteria and 
with due regard for the benefits of 
diversity for the board, including gender.annual report and accounts 2017 33
strategic report governance financial statements the board.the members of the 
committee are:
 – joanne lake (chairman);
 – stephen karle; and
 – peter ward.the risk & compliance committee 
comprises all of the non-executive 
directors of the group, namely:
 – patrick storey (chairman);
 – stephen karle;
 – sir nigel knowles;
 – joanne lake; and
 – peter ward.the executive committee is 
accountable to the board and its 
responsibilities include the daily 
management of the group’s affairs.the committee 
meets periodically when it has proposals 
to consider – generally three times a 
year.the committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for those management level 
tiers below the executive directors; it uses this information to ensure a consistent approach to remuneration throughout 
the company.we therefore focus our work 
on assessing the appropriateness of 
estimated behavioural lives and the 
validity and accuracy of the deferred 
revenue balance.these companies account for 100% of the group’s net assets, 100% of 
the group’s revenue and 100% of the group’s pre-tax profit.our duty to read other information in the annual report
under international standards on auditing (uk and ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.the directors assess on an ongoing basis whether there is objective evidence that a loan asset or group of loan assets is 
impaired and requires a deduction for impairment.impairment is then 
calculated by estimating the future cash flows for such impaired loans, discounting the cash-flows to a present value using the 
original eir and comparing this figure with the balance sheet carrying value.contributions payable to the group’s pension scheme are 
charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.the directors have considered these risks in the group’s forecasts and projections 
which highlight continued profitability for the foreseeable future.deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.the charge relating to grants to employees of the company is recognised as an expense in the profit 
and loss account.shelby finance limited is an instalment loan business and so is not integrated within the 
operation of the company.annual report and accounts 2017 61
