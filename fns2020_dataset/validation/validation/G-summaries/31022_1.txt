experience and expertise
geraldine is a uk registered pharmacist and holds a doctorate degree 
in pharmaceutics from the university of london.good information flows between the board and management 
are essential for effective governance together with senior 
management to ensure: that the agendas are appropriate for the 
business and are forward looking as well as providing historical 
and current results data; that papers are of an appropriate length 
and content for the non-executive directors in particular to be

fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
the committee noted the challenge in providing an understandable 
assessment of performance in 2017 due to the distortions in the 
comparative 2016 period comprising the merger, the change in 
accounting reference date plus two material royalty streams ceasing 
in 2016. this was added to by the matter raised by the frc above 
and the need to improve compliance with the esma guidelines.alongside input from the group’s brokers, the committee agreed 
with the need to provide proforma information for 2016 as well as 
other apms to assist users in understanding 2017 performance.sufficient information to enable the committee to 
discharge its responsibilities is made available from management and 
the committee has access to the company secretary and to employees 
more widely if there are any matters for which the committee requires 
further information.bonuses are paid at the discretion 
of the committee.the committee 
takes into account overall 
corporate performance and 
individual performance when 
determining the final bonus 
amount to be awarded.however, as a result of the outcome of the performance conditions, all awards lapsed.the company and the 
group maintain insurance policies for its directors and officers in 
respect of liabilities which could arise in the discharge of their duties.this included reconciliation of accrued 
but not billed income at the year end to the post 
year end royalty reports, cash (where received) 
and credit notes;
— assessing forecasts: assessing the 
reasonableness of the income accrued at the 
year end by considering the consistency 
between forecast royalties and those confirmed 
by third party royalty statements for the fourth 
quarter of the year;
— test of details: agreeing a statistical sample of 
december and january product and device sales 
invoices to supporting evidence, such as third 
party delivery confirmations, to assess the 
appropriateness of the period of revenue 
recognition.forecast-based valuation
the carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investment in subsidiaries is 
significant and at risk of not being 
recoverable due to the carrying value of 
certain investment exceeding the net assets 
value of the subsidiary and/or the 
subsidiaries being loss-making.the judgement of whether and how much to provide is formed after taking external professional advice, and is based on management’s 
judgement of the potential tax that could be assessed as due.the key estimate is which patent or midpoint of the patents to use, due to the varying strength of the patents and different time periods 
for different territories.revenues from non-recurring sources comprise of milestones and development services revenues, which can vary materially between 
reporting periods and non-recurring royalties related to the discontinued royalties from advate

 and the termination of legacy vectura 
royalties with gsk for the ellipta

 products which is currently subject to a legal dispute (refer to note 10 “exceptional items”).the etr is expected to remain in the low-teens (credit) percentage rate in the short to medium term as a result of reduced loss relief available 
to offset against taxable profits, as well as the expected increase in the swiss tax rate following the proposed reform.the board believes that, in addition to the implementation of the current investment strategy, the buyback reflects strong financial 
management discipline and is an efficient allocation of capital.
