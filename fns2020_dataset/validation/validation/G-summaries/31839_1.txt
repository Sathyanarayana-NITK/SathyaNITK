key audit matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter
accounting for disposals (group) 
refer also to note 28
we focussed on this area as the group recorded significant profit 
on disposals (£175m) following the divestment of its artificial lift, 
interconnect power and microwave telecoms businesses during the 
year, along with its wallace product line (disclosed in note 28 to the 
financial statements)
judgement arose in determining the value of goodwill allocated to 
the wallace product line.a provision 
of £84m has been made for the costs which the group is expected to 
incur in respect of these claims.see note 22 for  
a sensitivity showing the range of expected future spend.the basis of documentation and effectiveness testing of 
hedges under the new standard will be linked more closely to the risk management objectives, which may generate different levels of 
ineffectiveness than the current testing under ias 39. receivables provisioning will move from an incurred to an expected loss model.the expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various territories in which the losses arise.• long-term growth rates: as required by ias 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term 
gdp projections of the primary market for the cgu.given the evidence that emerged of inconsistent 
duplicate claims, there is a significant likelihood that this will lead to changes in the pattern of claims made in the future, and the costs 
arising from claims.
