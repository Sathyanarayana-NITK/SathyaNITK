governance  shaftesbury annual report 2017
the committee is an important element of the 
group’ s governance structure and provides effective 
oversight of the performance, independence and 
objectivity of the auditor and the audit process.other areas of judgement
whilst not material in the context of the group’ s assets or net assets, 
the committee reviewed the judgements made by management in 
calculating the charge for equity-settled remuneration.the chairman of the committee 
and the finance director also met with an independent partner of ernst & 
young llp .in setting 
targets, we use the group’ s kpis which drive value 
through the delivery of long-term rental growth.first, we are increasing the weighting of the “growth 
in erv” metric from 20% to 35% of the overall 
bonus to reflect the strategic importance of rental 
growth to the business.•  
ensure that the executive  
directors are remunerated 
fairly and responsibly with the 
long-term interests of the 
company in mind.at 30 september 2017, the company’ s issued share 
capital comprised 279,032,329 ordinary shares of 25p each.we conclude that the 
inputs and methodology applied are 
reasonable and that the external 
valuations are an appropriate 
assessment of the fair value of 
investment properties at 30 
september 2017.
we did not identify any exceptions 
or material errors in the input 
testing for the sample we tested.109

other information 
the other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report including the strategic report overview, strategic report annual 
review, governance and other information (including shareholder 
information, portfolio analysis, basis of valuation, summary report by the 
valuers, sustainability and the glossary of terms) set out on pages 1 to 104 
and 139 to 147, other than the financial statements and our auditor’ s report 
thereon.new accounting standards and interpretations 
a)   the following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were relevant to the group and mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
ended 30 september 2017:
standard or interpretation effective from
annual improvements 2012-2014 1 january 2016
amendments to ifrs 11 joint arrangements on acquisition of an interest in a joint operation 1 january 2016
amendments to ias 16 and ias 38 on depreciation and amortisation 1 january 2016
amendments to ias 27 separate financial statements on equity accounting 1 january 2016
amendments to ifrs 10, 12 and ias 28 on consolidation for investment entities 1 january 2016
amendments to ias 1 presentation of financial statements disclosure initiative 1 january 2016
no material changes to accounting policies arose as a result of these amendments.at the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on actual 
and forecast net asset values.all other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a 
property, and an increase in the erv would increase the capital value, and vice versa.charles smith has been 
the signatory of valuation reports addressed to the company and the 
subsidiary companies since 2013. cushman & wakefield debenham tie 
leung limited (“c&w”) has been carrying out this valuation instruction for 
the company, and now the subsidiary companies, for a continuous period 
since 1996. as well as preparing our reports, we also undertake valuations  
of certain of the properties referred to in our reports for other purposes, 
such as secured lending and for inclusion in shareholders’ circulars.cushman & wakefield’ s financial year end is 31st december.
