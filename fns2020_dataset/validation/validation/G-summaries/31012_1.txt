made significant progress on a number of fronts.i am delighted we were able to conclude this 
strategically important transaction in an efficient and timely 
manner, and welcomed the overwhelming support of our 
shareholders in approving the sale (with over 99.9% of the 
total proxy votes cast having been recorded in favour of

for outcomes short of maximum to ensure alignment of pay with 
performance and with shareholder interests.the non-executive chairman receives an 
all-inclusive fee for fulfilling the role.in setting the targets, the committee ensures 
that they are sufficiently stretching and that there is an appropriate 
balance between incentivising executive directors to meet targets for

risk and encourage inappropriate behaviours.participation in the ltip is offered to the most senior executives 
and those identified as having the greatest potential to influence 
performance within the group.the committee believes it is important for executive directors that a 
significant proportion of their remuneration is performance-related 
and the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements 
support the delivery of the company’s strategy.the remuneration committee carried out a thorough review of the achievement of the strategic objectives, in particular considering the 
significant focus and effort required to accelerate the group portfolio strategy through the sale of the transportation division which realised
