investor expectations and the medium-term business plan following the ipo.in light of the current 
economic and political uncertainty, the remuneration committee concluded that a review of the 
current structure was appropriate from a business perspective and necessary in order to maintain 

other senior executives over the near future.the fy18 ltip proposed performance measures, weightings and targets are outlined in the table

housebuilders’ performance, other housebuilders have recovered largely as a result of the 
government’s help-to-buy scheme which is not applicable to the company.when determining an  
appropriate level of salary,

within the group
 the general performance  
of the group
 salaries within the ranges  
paid by the companies in

in line with practice relative

executive directors with the

opinion that given the 
commercial sensitivity arising 
in relation to the detailed 

bonus, disclosing precise

the committee retains the 
discretion to:
