the vip club to then benefit from a host of exclusive 
special offers and flash sales.presentation of results
t o present a clear view of performance of the group in total and the costs directly driven by the growth strategy, 
we present an underlying operating (loss)/profit number and an adjusted ebitda number.the adjusted ebitda number further excludes depreciation, amortisation 
and accelerated opening costs to give a clear view on the underlying trading performance of the group – 
adjusted ebitda is our primary internal measure when assessing group performance.in the year, these costs amounted to £1.2m (2016: £1.6m) 
and are analysed by component of spend in the table below.during the year the group met its day-to-day general corporate and working capital requirements through existing cash resources.overall, the directors believe the group is well placed to manage its business risks and successful execute the growth strategy.auditor

depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.the assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in an independently administered fund.dividend income is recognised in the income  
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.the calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
