the group specialists are 
engaged in defining the group level risk profile, which is used 
in deriving the principal risks shown on pages 43 to 45 and in 
arriving at the viability statement on pages 95 and 96.
in addition to the above, the businesses maintain their own 
risk registers and risk reporting, which are produced by each 
executive team and regularly reviewed by their local entity arc.in addition, our employee benefits business frequently helps 
clients to improve their own capabilities in the area of employee 
wellbeing through helping to minimise risks and deliver 
healthcare and rehabilitation support services, contributing to 
enhanced labour standards in the markets we serve.for more detail on the principal risks we track and the 
governance structure we apply to maintain rigorous risk 
management, see pages 41 to 45.

reduction of bribery and corruption risk by managing and 
providing oversight of the group's abc policies, and providing 
tools, training and specialist expertise including investigation.the whistleblowing policy is actively communicated during 
the year and managers are required to ensure that their teams 
understand the purpose of the policy, how concerns can be 
raised, and the protections afforded to employees.the strategic report is signed for and on behalf of the board.two directors retired 
from the board during the year: bruce 
carnegie-brown retired in june, following 
his appointment as the chairman

the chairman and the group company secretary.richard meddings joined the committee 
on 2 october 2017, bringing a broad 
range of skills and experience, including 
many years as a finance director and as  
a chartered accountant.the board is satisfied that andrew didham and richard 
meddings each possess recent and relevant financial 
experience for the purposes of the code and the requisite 
competence in accounting.the committee concluded that the key assumptions made were reasonable and that the overall pension deficit is 
appropriately calculated.the review supported the directors in satisfying themselves 
that they could make the statement on page 95 of the annual 
report and financial statements that the annual report and 
financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.the committee also spent time considering succession 
planning in respect of the chairman and is comfortable that an 
appropriate plan is in place.the 2017 underlying basic eps will be used as the base year 
for the purposes of this award and includes the costs of the

the current environment.between 1 january 2018 and 22 february 2018 (being the latest practicable date prior to the posting of this report) the trustees of the jardine lloyd 
thompson group plc all employee share plan have acquired 21 shares on behalf of dominic burke.the committee is comfortable that the deloitte llp

lloyd thompson group plc that may impair their objectivity 
and independence.90    corporate governance
