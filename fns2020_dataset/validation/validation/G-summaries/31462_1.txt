each risk 
has been assessed to determine the 
likelihood of occurrence together with 
the potential impact on the group.therefore, at the moment, the board 
does not consider brexit to be a principal risk to the business 
model, but will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation.group adjusted profit after 
tax increased by 18% to £10.6m (fy16 pf: 
£8.9m).the net movement in cash and cash equivalents was an outflow of £4.6m (fy16: inflow of £3.4m).the rental 
charge for the period amounted to £11.2m 
(fy16 pf: £11.1m), with the increase principally 
a result of the additional sites compared to 
the same period last year.—

our audit approach
context
ten entertainment group plc is a tenpin bowling operator 
and operations are wholly uk-based.the directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.the excess of the cost of the acquisition 
over the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.going concern
the group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
with the assistance of its bank facilities.critical accounting estimates and judgements 
the preparation of financial statements requires the use 
of accounting estimates, and requires management to exercise 
judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies.accounting estimates are based on historical experience and various 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis of making the judgements about the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.intangible assets
goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition of a 
subsidiary or business combination over the fair value of the group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired.it is anticipated 
that the group will continue to look to continue to take advantage of the changes in market conditions and could incur further re-gear costs through its exceptional 
items over the next two to three-year period.business combination – eastbourne
on 21 february 2017, the group acquired the assets and trade 
of the eastbourne bowling site known as the lanes, part of the 
david lloyd leisure centre.the goodwill is made up of the 
expected benefits to arise from tenpinisation of the site’s operations 
and processes under the management of the tenpin brand.the depreciation and impairment charges are recognised in administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.the group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount 
of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the 
face of the consolidated balance sheet.
