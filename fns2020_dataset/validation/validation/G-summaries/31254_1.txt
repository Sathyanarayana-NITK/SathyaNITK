the group also 
has a sound balance sheet, a strong core business in 
the uk and exciting emerging opportunities in both 
the us and australasia.the total value of the group’s 155 portfolio 
companies (excluding multi-sector platforms, organic 
investments and de minimis holdings), calculated by 
reference to the group’s holding in such companies 
and grossed up to reflect their total value, is now 
in excess of £4bn, or approximately £5bn including 
the group’s three holdings in multi-sector platform 
companies (oxford sciences innovation plc, 
cambridge innovation capital plc and frontier  
ip group plc) (2016: £2.7bn, £3.3bn).these investments were also 
pleasing as they attracted funds and world class 
companies who had not previously invested in oxford 
including goldman sachs, google ventures and just 
post year-end, sequoia china.25829-04      10 may 2018 3:41 pm   proof nine

statement of comprehensive income
overall the group recorded a profit for the year of £53.4m (2016: loss of £14.8m) and a return on hard nav, i.e.however, the group’s risk management programme 
can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
that principal risks are managed to an acceptable level.our portfolio companies, which are primarily focused 
on the healthcare, technology, clean technology and 
biotechnology sectors, are developing solutions to 
some of the most significant social, environmental 
and health challenges faced in the world today.the group is a signatory to the 
prompt payment code.this is considered the most appropriate metric 
given that the majority of emissions result from the 
operation of the group’s offices and the day-to-day 
activities of the employees.whilst 
seeking to support entrepreneurial behaviour in its 
partner institutions through the identification of 
compelling intellectual property with the potential 
to grow into robust, unique and world changing 
business propositions, the board also seeks to 
provide entrepreneurial leadership within a framework 
of controls for assessing and managing risk; defining, 
challenging and interrogating the group’s strategic 
aims and direction.the 
schedule of matters reserved for board decision 
and approval are those significant to the group 
as a whole due to their strategic, financial and/or 
reputational implications.specifically on gender, whilst, as stated 
above, the group does not consider it appropriate nor 
in its best interests to set group-wide fixed targets for 
women in leadership positions at this stage, both the 
group’s chief executive officer and chairman signed 
up to the 30% club in january 2018, in connection with 
which they have committed to setting an aspirational 
target of 30% female representation in the group’s 
leadership team by 2020. the group is in the process 
of setting up a working group whose mandate will be 
to examine ways in which this aspirational target may 
be achieved and to thereafter lead action on those 
actions decided upon.the role of the chief executive officer is to lead 
the delivery of the strategy and the executive 
management of the group and its operating 
businesses.the company secretary acts 
as a key point of contact for the chairman and has 
an important role in the quality of information that 
flows between the executive directors and the non-
executive directors and the company secretary 
is also responsible for ensuring agreed actions are 
completed.in accordance with the 
company’s articles of association, directors have 
been granted an indemnity issued by the company 
to the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their office.supplementary meetings of the board and/or the 
committees are held as and when necessary in 
response to business needs.there is currently no maximum term on 
the chairman’s appointment but the nomination 
committee has agreed to keep this under review in 
light of possible amendments to the code (currently 
being consulted upon) over the next 12 months.the board views 
the effective operation of a rigorous system of 
internal control as critical to the success of the group.the results of all proxy voting are published on the 
group’s website after the meeting and declared at 
the meeting itself to those shareholders who attend.base salaries will be set by the 
committee taking into account:
 y scale, scope and 
responsibility of the role;
 y skills and experience of the 
individual;
 y retention risk;
 y base salary of other 
employees;
 y base salary of individuals 
undertaking similar roles in 
companies of comparable 
size and complexity; and
 y appropriate market 
benchmarks.83
