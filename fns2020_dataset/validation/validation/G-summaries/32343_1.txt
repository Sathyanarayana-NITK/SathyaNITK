dividend
the directors have approved a fourth 
quarterly interim dividend of 2.1p 
per share, payable on 10 july 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 9 june 2017 , 
bringing the total amount paid and 
payable for 2017 to 7 .5p, an increase of 
0.25p compared with the previous year.the group’s policy is to substantially 
de-risk the impact of movements in 
interest rates by entering into hedging 
arrangements.a sensitivity analysis was carried out 
which involved ﬂexing a number of key 
assumptions to consider the impact of 
changes to the group’s principal risks 
affecting the viability of the business, 
being:
• changes to macro-economic 
conditions impacting rental income 
levels and property values
• changes in the retail environment 
impacting occupancy levels 
and lettings
• changes in the availability of funds 
impacting committed expenditure 
and investment transactions
the business model was stress tested 
to validate its resilience to property 
valuation and rental income decline, as 
well as increases in future libor and swap 
rates.(for more details

governance introduction from the chairman
good governance is embedded 
into the way we manage our 
business to create a culture of 
appropriate decision making, risk 
assessment and transparency at all 
levels in the organisation.furthermore we are 
committed to enhancing the business 
environments in which we operate as 
discussed in detail in the responsible 
business section of the strategic report.the executive committee meets 
monthly to discuss ﬁnancial and 
operating targets and performance, 
property transactions and the 
management of the business and 
its staff.there are informal meetings 
between the executive directors at 
other times and due to the size of 
the organisation they are involved 
in all signiﬁcant business discussions 
and decisions.as a result of this search 
andrew livingston was appointed as 
a non executive director and member  
of the audit committee on 31 may 2016,  
replacing charles cayzer who retired 
from the board in september 2016.
philip watson replaced charles cayzer 
as senior independent director and 
rosalyn wilton and james dean were 
appointed to the remuneration and 
nomination committees respectively.professional development
newly appointed directors participate 
in a tailored induction programme 
and receive a comprehensive pack of 
information on the group, its business 
and the governance structure.the directors unanimously considered 
the board to have the appropriate 
complement of skills required to 
monitor performance, challenge 
management, promote debate 
and develop strategy.the committee drives succession 
planning for directors and other 
senior executive positions and 
ensures that the refreshment process 
is properly planned and managed 
to maintain stability and mitigate 
business disruption.emerging 
risks are tabled at meetings of the executive 
committee
progress against 2016 targets
board performance and evaluation
the board is committed to undertaking 
an annual internal review of its 
performance and of its committees 
and an externally facilitated review 
every three years.the committee met ﬁve times last 
year, with meetings aligned to the 
company’s ﬁnancial reporting 
timetable.at the march 
meeting, the committee reviewed 
risk management and internal control 
processes and considered the year 
end audit plan.after reviewing reports from 
management and following its 
discussions with the auditor and 
valuers, the committee is satisﬁed 
that the key ﬁnancial judgements and 
estimates have been appropriately 
and adequately addressed by the 
executive directors, reviewed by the 
external auditor and reported in these 
ﬁnancial statements.it considered the quarterly reports presented by the finance director to the board 
which included the group’s three year proﬁt and cash ﬂow forecasts, committed 
and undrawn debt facilities and expected headroom under the ﬁnancial covenants 
in those facilities.the key elements of the group’s 
internal control framework are 
as follows:
• a deﬁned schedule of matters 
reserved for the board’s attention
• a documented appraisal and 
approval process for all signiﬁcant 
capital expenditure
• a comprehensive and robust system 
of ﬁnancial budgeting, forecasting 
and reporting
• short term cash ﬂow forecasting 
that is considered weekly by the 
executive committee
• an integrated ﬁnancial and property 
management system
• an organisational structure with 
clearly deﬁned roles, responsibilities 
and limits of authority that 
facilitates effective and efficient 
decision making
• close involvement of the executive 
directors in day to day operations 
including regular meetings 
with senior management on all 
operational aspects of the business
• disciplined monthly meetings 
of the executive, investment, 
asset management and 
finance committees
• the maintenance of a risk register 
and quarterly risk dashboard 
highlighting movements in 
principal and emerging risks 
and mitigation strategies
• a formal whistle blowing policy
the requirement for a dedicated 
internal audit function was reviewed 
by the audit committee during the 
year and was not felt to be necessary 
or appropriate given the size and 
structure of the group, the close day 
to day involvement of the executive 
directors and the internal control 
procedures in place.the policy we have operated for 
the past three ﬁnancial years was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 
agm and our new policy, which is 
presented on pages 88 to 99, is being 
put forward for a binding vote at the 
forthcoming agm.2014 ltips vesting in the year – targets and outcomes

the level of ltip vesting in 2017 demonstrates the long term successful performance of the company over the performance 
period with strong absolute earnings growth and a resulting comparative return performance in excess of the company’s 
direct competitors.88 londonmetric property plc | annual report and accounts 2017 strategic report governance financial statements
