review and assessment 
the risk committee consolidates the
businesses, functional and group risks to 
compile the group’s key risks.principal risks
the plc directors have carried out an 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group – including, in the year to 30 
june 2017, those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or reputation.under the terms of the company’s banking arrangements, in the 
event that a person or group of persons acting in concert gains 
control of the company, the lending banks may require, by giving 
not less than 30 days’ notice, the repayment and cancellation of 
the facilities.as a 
board we are committed to maintaining the highest standards 
of corporate governance and understand that an effective, 
challenging and diverse board is essential to enable the group 
to deliver its strategy and long-term shareholder value.further details regarding this engagement 
with our shareholders are set out on page 43.the audit committee met three times during the year, the 
remuneration committee met three times during the year and the 
nomination committee met once during the year.in the year the range of 
subjects discussed by the board included:
 z the strategy of the group in response to changing economic 
conditions;
 z key business areas, including the combination of former legal 
and finance divisions into one new professional division;
 z the identification, execution and integration of acquisitions;
 z the review of the scope and progress of project sixth gear;
 z the london property portfolio review;
 z the group’s debt and capital structure, including the 
extension of the debt facility;
 z the group’s financial results;
 z dividend policy;
 z regulatory and governance issues;

the start of the year to the date of approval of this report.following the adoption by the uk financial reporting council 
of certain parts of the eu regulation and directive on audit 
reform, that govern permissible non-audit services provided by 
the auditor, the audit committee took the decision to discontinue

dear shareholder
on behalf of the board it is my pleasure to present  
the nomination committee report for the year  
ended 30 june 2017 .accordingly, a radical overhaul of the policy is not 
proposed (including that there are no changes to the overall 
structure of the remuneration package or the quantum of variable 
pay), but minor changes are proposed as follows:
 z we have formally incorporated within the policy our 
shareholding guidelines, in accordance with which executive 
directors must retain 50% of shares acquired on the vesting of 
psp awards until a holding equal to 100% of base salary has 
been achieved; 
 z reflecting changes in corporate governance, we have formally 
incorporated within the policy malus provisions on both the 
annual bonus and psp awards; and
 z the policy reflects the proposal to operate a new psp for 
awards in respect of the 2018/2019 financial year and future 
financial years.wilmington plc annual report and financial statements for the year ended 30 june 2017

annual report on remuneration 25570-4   ar2017  27 september 2017 10:58 am   proof 4
for the year ended 30 june 2017:
 z eps growth in excess of rpi was 10.1%, roe (for psp)

 was 32.3% and the company’s tsr was positioned 61
st
 out of 149 
comparator companies for the three year performance period ending 30 june 2017 and 84.13% of maximum ltip award will vest 
(these amounts represent the group’s best estimates and are subject to final confirmation from the committee’s adviser aon hewitt 
limited due to be finalised shortly after the finalisation of these financial statements);
 z the value shown for psp includes the value of dividends that would have accrued on vested shares during the performance period 
that will subsequently be paid to the participants; and
 z the psp awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant (vesting date), the estimated value of the vested shares 
shown above is based on the three month average share price to 30 june 2017 (£2.54).total salary and fees 
for the year ended 30 june 2017 (audited information)
total salary and fees are based on the need to retain the skills and knowledge that the executive and non-executive directors bring 
to the company.during the year, the committee received independent advice from the following external consultants:
committees advisors
2017/18
£’000
aon hewitt limited provided advice to the committee on market practice, governance and performance analysis.opportunity the company contributes an amount equal to 10% of salary to a pension scheme on behalf 
of the executive directors, and/or as a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions 
where appropriate.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and parent company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the companies act 2006 
and, as regards the group financial statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.we focused on this area because the timing of revenue 
recognition and its presentation in the income statement has 
inherent complexities for wilmington, some of which are industry 
related, in particular:
 z significant or one-off contracts entered into near the year end 
which could contain multiple elements (such as the sale of 
publications accompanied by training) or for which revenue 
should be spread over the term of the contract rather than 
recognised immediately; and
 z subscription revenues are partly managed in electronic 
worksheets and/or other legacy customer management 
systems, meaning that there is a higher risk of error or 
manipulation of the calculation of deferred revenue.in establishing the overall approach to the group 
audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be 
performed at the reporting units by us as the group engagement 
team.25570-4   ar2017  27 september 2017 10:58 am   proof 4

c) basis of consolidation
the group’s consolidated financial statements incorporate the results and net assets of wilmington plc and all its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 30 june each year.deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and law) that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax 
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortised through the income statement on a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful lives.q) provisions for future purchase of non-controlling interests
on the acquisition of less than 100% of certain subsidiary undertakings, the group may enter into put and call options with the holders 
of the shares not owned by the group, to purchase their interests at a later date.the total 
amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified existing conditions are to 
be satisfied.restructuring and rationalisation costs comprise primarily of £500,000 of costs relating to the implementation of project sixth gear, 
and £300,000 of redundancy and property costs following the group’s decision to relocate part of the back office functions from its 
head offices in central london to our existing freehold premises in basildon, essex.15. investments in subsidiaries
