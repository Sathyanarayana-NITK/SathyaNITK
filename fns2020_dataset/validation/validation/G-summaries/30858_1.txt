student engagement, through our experience in data analytics 
and student barometers from the i-graduate line of business.while the group has a net

the remuneration report details the group’s remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration 
of both executive and non-executive directors
remuneration policy
the full directors’ remuneration policy is shown below for ease of reference, updated with minor changes.the remuneration committee (“the committee”) operates the annual bonus plan and long-term incentive plans according to their 
respective rules, the listing rules and hmrc rules where relevant.in the event of a change of control, an award may vest early 
subject to the extent the performance conditions have been achieved and scaled back pro rata for service, although the committee 
has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating.the shareholding guideline for the chief 
executive and chief financial officer is to hold shares to the value of their base salary within no more than five years of appointment.the appointment and replacement of directors is governed 
by the company’s articles of association, the uk corporate 
governance code, the companies act 2006 and related 
legislations.independence
we remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the uk, which includes the frc’s ethical standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.the assumptions and judgements  
in assessing the carrying value of the intangibles are judgemental, 
giving rise to risk in respect of valuation.the group principally operates from the uk and australia, accounting for 85% of total revenues, and across 3 business segments, 
sms, i-graduate and qas.the uk firm performed all audit work except the audit of australian tax balances where we determined the australian firm had the 
better expertise and knowledge.conclusions relating to going concern
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which isas (uk) require us to report to you when: 
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.strategic report and directors’ report
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the strategic report and directors’ 
report for the year ended 31 december 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.it also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies.for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units (“cgus”) expected to benefit from the combination.to the extent that the creation of 
goodwill originally gave rise to a merger reserve, upon impairment an appropriate amount is transferred from the merger reserve 
to the profit and loss reserve.with the exception of afs equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and 
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the 
impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.71 financial statements governance strategic report introduction
4. business segments
information reported to the group’s chief executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance is focused on the nature of each type of activity.the group’s reportable segments and principal activities under  
ifrs 8 are detailed below:
student management systems (“sms”) represents the delivery of software and subsequent maintenance and support services 
and the activities through which we deploy and configure our software for our customers;
i-graduate, represents a portfolio of performance improvement tools and services, including analytics, software solutions, facilities 
and asset management; and
quality assurance solutions (“qas”), representing inspection and review services which support the assessment of 
educational delivery.these calculations use risk adjusted cash flow 
projections based on the financial budget approved by management for the period to 31 december 2018. the budget was prepared 
based on past experience, strategic plans and management’s expectation for the markets in which they operate including adjustments for 
known contract ends, contract related inflationary increases and planned cost savings.the total facility is committed until june 2018, subject to compliance with covenants and 
was agreed in august 2017. as at 31 december 2017, the group had net cash of £14.1m (2016: of £8.8m), reflecting gross cash 
balances of £14.1m (2016: £10.3m) offset by nil outstanding on the overdraft facility (2016: £1.4m).expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group’s share price over the term commensurate 
with the expected term immediately prior to the date of grant.as a condition 
of the exemption, the company has guaranteed the year-end liabilities of these subsidiaries until they are settled in full.disclosures on directors’ remuneration, share 
options, long-term incentive schemes, and pension contributions are contained in the directors’ remuneration section within the 
audited part of the remuneration report on pages 45 to 49 and form part of these audited financial statements.
