the year.revenue recognition was also a key focus for the 
auditors and they reported to the committee on their work and findings.the annual report on remuneration outlines how our policy has been 
implemented in financial year ended 31 march 2017 and how we intend to 
implement it in the financial year ending 31 march 2018. as noted in my 
report last year i am committed to increased openness and consultation on 
remuneration matters and have ensured there is greater transparency of, and 
weighting to, performance and outcomes and how this effects annual bonus/
variable allocation in this year’s report.these 
achievements alongside performance against the key performance indicators 
set by the committee for the executive directors (see the annual report on 
remuneration for further details) are an important consideration in relation to 
the overall remuneration package for the executive directors, and have been 
reflected when determining the executive directors’ overall remuneration 
package and can be summarised as follows:
• salary/fixed allocation to increase by 5%, the first increase in base 
remuneration for the executive directors for three years, and compares 
with an increase of 12% for the average employee/member over the 
same period and retail price index of 5.7% over the period march 2014 to 
march 2017;
• pension/cash payments in lieu of pension for the executive directors to 
remain unchanged at 10% salary/fixed allocation for the financial year 
ending 31 march 2018;
• annual bonuses and/or variable allocations to the executive directors of 
between 258% and 416% of base remuneration, with the cash element 
for john ions capped at 200% of salary/fixed allocation.elements of reward
