committee report
however , looking ahead as the group 
grows and as new positions become 
available, the board diversity policy 
commits the group to:
• a corporate culture which hires 
candidates on merit based on the 
most appropriate range of skills and 
experience for a role, and offers 
equal opportunities for all employees, 
regardless of gender (as well as 
ethnic origin, background or physical 
disabilities);
• secure senior leadership commitment 
to the diversity agenda and to raise 
awareness about the benefits of a 
diverse workforce;
• require external recruitment consultants 
to submit their diversity policies to the 
group before taking on any board or 
executive management search;
• ensure that external consultants submit 
candidate shortlists reflecting an 
appropriate gender balance, relative 
to the target recruitment market, for 
consideration by the nomination 
and governance committee in 
connection with any board or executive 
management appointment;
• a target of at least one female director 
on the board; and
• an annual review by the nomination 
and governance committee of its 
progress complying with the best 
practice recommendations for  
gender diversity .debra valentine  
was appointed to the committee when 
john malcolm stepped down to take  
up the role of chairman of the board.in light of the accumulated feedback, the 
committee remains satisfied of deloitte 
llp’s independence and effectiveness 
and the board concurs with the 
assessment by the committee.necessary amendments to the  
ia plan are made during the year , subject 
to the committee’s approval, in instances

view/actions of the committee 
with respect to signiﬁcant judgements
the committee reviewed the reasonableness of judgements made regarding the cost to complete estimates, 
recognition of variation orders and contractual claims, and the adequacy of contingency provisions to 
mitigate contract speciﬁc risks.in particular the committee focused on any onerous contract to ensure 
that the assumptions made to assess the contract loss were appropriate.the committee reports 
on its monitoring and observations to the 
board at least annually .relative to pay and employment 
conditions in the group 
the committee takes account of 
remuneration levels offered to the 
senior management team in the group 
as well as the awards affecting the 
wider employee population.from 2017, the committee’s terms of reference 
were extended to ensure the appropriate level of board attention 
is given to executive performance, talent development  and 
retention through effective succession planning and identification 
of succession issues.these shares were due to vest on  
17 november 2017. in accordance with the rules of the plan, the 
shares vested pro-rata to the termination date of 20 september 
2017. accordingly mr kennedy vested in 116,047 shares.payments for loss of office
a payment of £85,682 was made to john kennedy by way of 
compensation to recognise his contribution 66. 
percentage change in remuneration levels (unaudited)
the table below and opposite shows the movement in base 
salary, benefits and annual bonus for the ceo between the 2017  
and 2016 financial years, compared to that for the average 
employee of the group.the 
authorities now sought, if granted, will 
expire on the earlier of the conclusion of 
the agm of the company next year and 
the date which is 15 months after the 
granting of the authorities.the 
audit and risk committee oversees the 
implementation of this approach.the assessment of the recoverability of non-current assets 
requires management to exercise judgement as described in the “critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty” section of the annual report in note 4 and the “significant 
judgements” section in the audit & risk committee report on page 55.
how the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
our audit work assessed the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions in preparation of the 
pp&e and intangibles impairment assessment.in the current year the group encountered major operational challenges on the  
east anglia one project which resulted in a significant loss for the group (usd 80.4 million).• assessing the recoverability of related receivables, including testing of post year end cash receipts, 
and completeness and validity of any contract loss provisions through completion of the above 
procedures; and
• on the east anglia one project, understanding the basis for and obtaining evidence in respect of 
management’s judgement that the maximum potential exposure of usd 33.8 million of lds that could 
be levied under the contract have been reduced through ongoing work with their client and their 
subcontractor to meet revised key delivery dates, as explained in the key judgement note 4.
key observations management have made certain judgements in relation to estimated project revenue, estimated  
project costs and the estimated margins recognised on projects including the significant loss making 
project, east anglia one.after reviewing its cash flow forecasts for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements, 
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.the basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.the effective date of the amendment has yet to be set by 
the iasb.amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold right over its estimated useful life.2.11 provisions
provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate of the amount  
of the obligation can be made.the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions 
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets).it recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.in the separate financial statements of the subsidiary, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the equity instruments of the company is recognised as an expense with a corresponding credit to equity .however , when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset (for example, contracts work-in-progress or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity 
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset.4.2.3 impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
the group determines at the end of the reporting period whether there are indicators of impairment in the carrying amount of its 
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other financial assets.the application of a 10% 
sensitivity to management estimates of the net realisable value of inventory would result in a reversal of the previous write down of 
usd 2.0 million if the net realisable value was higher or a decrease in inventory by usd 2.6 million if the net realisable value was lower .
