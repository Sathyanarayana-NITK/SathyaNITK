financial statements.control exists when the group has the power, directly 
or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities.the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the trade and other receivables account, and the amount 
of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses.the fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which there are 
restrictions in place in respect of the transfer of the award shares by the directors.the corresponding credits are recognised as income, spread equally across the shorter of useful economic life 
and the lease term of the respective aircraft.the cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset (and classified as an 
“aircraft maintenance asset”) at the earlier of: (a) the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met; or 
(b) when maintenance, including enhancement, is carried out.this change in estimates, combined with some other changes related to this area, resulted in €7.9 million 
additional revenue for 2017.
