are frequently used by hackers to distract from

timing of revenue recognition with regard to proper 
deferral of support revenues.this work also included comparison to 
industry data, historic trading, and macro-economic factors.responsibilities of directors

the notes on pages 40 to 63 form part of these financial statements.corero network security plc is a public limited company incorporated in the united kingdom under the companies act 2006 
and registered in england and wales.the directors have prepared detailed income statement, balance sheet and cash flow projections for the period to 31 december 
2019. these include cash of £4.0 million ($5.6 million) to be raised by the proposed equity fund raise to be announced by the 
company on 5 april 2018 and bank loan of £3.0 million ($4.2 million) which is expected to be drawn down following the 
completion of the equity fund raise.on this basis, the directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.4. maintenance and support services
revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement.development expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefit will result from the project and 
the following criteria are met:
• the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained;
• adequate, technical, financial and other resources are available to complete and sell or use the intangible asset;
• the group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate future economic benefits and the ability to use or sell the 
intangible asset can be demonstrated;
• it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use it or sell it; and 
• the development costs can be measured reliably.the following useful lives were applied during the year:
• computer software acquired – 3 years straight line
• capitalised development expenditure – 5 years straight line
• amortisation costs are included within operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.effective date, periods beginning after 1 january 2019
the effect on the financial statements of the application of the standards and interpretations that are expected to have a 
significant impact or are relevant to the group, is:
ifrs 15 – revenue from contracts with customers
the standard requires an analysis of 5 key steps:
1. identify the contract with the customer;
2. identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3. determine the transaction price;
4. allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and
5. recognise revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.details of the main assumptions used in the assessment of the carrying value 
of the group’s cash generating unit is set out in note 8.
impairment of investments and intercompany balances (applies to the company financial statements only)
the directors have reviewed the carrying value of the intercompany balances and cost of investments in subsidiaries of the 
company with reference to current and future trading conditions.besp fair value prices are adjusted for future quarters if management identifies a  
pattern of variances, greater than 10%, between actual selling prices versus the then current besp.the management of the group believe these growth rates are appropriate for the forecasts given the expected impact from 
the smartwall sales traction in 2017, the focus on delivering sales growth through channel partners, the expected contribution 
from go-to-market partners to expand the opportunities corero can sell into and the 100gbps and virtual software products 
introduced in late 2017, all of which are expected to deliver a step change in revenue in the forecast period.24. contingent liabilities
corero network security (uk) limited was in december 2015 awarded a grant of up to £600,000 for a development project over 
three years from scottish enterprise.if an option holder ceases to be in employment or hold office within the group, options granted shall immediately lapse unless 
such cessation is because of the option holder’s death; the option holder’s ill health or disability; the company that employs the 
option holder ceasing to be under the control of the company or such company ceasing to be within the group; the transfer of 
sale of the undertaking or part-undertaking in which the option holder is employed to a person who is neither under the control 
of the company nor within the group; or any other reason that the board in its absolute discretion shall determine.on a cessation of employment or office as set out above, options shall be exercisable to the extent they have vested according 
to the terms of the option agreement and the provisions of the relevant share option scheme and must be exercised within 30 
days following such cessation unless it is by reason of death whereby the option holder’s personal representatives must exercise 
the option within 12 months following the date of the option holder’s death.no options were exercised and 1,673,500 options were forfeited in the 12 months to 31 december 2017. on 9 june 2017, the 
company announced the cancellation and re-granting of options over ordinary shares to certain directors and employees, with an 
option re-grant price of 13.6p (“new option grant price”) being the weighted average price of the company’s historic investment 
rounds).
