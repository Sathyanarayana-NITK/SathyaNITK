determine if any of our other customers has been the victim of an attack similar 
in nature.how we will leverage this moving forward
we already work as cyber security and assurance partners to many of the 
world’s leading vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers.in both of these areas the board has a low risk 
appetite and the new strategies will operate inside that.risk register
the group maintains a risk register, which:
 z sets out the group’s risk appetite;
 z identifies the key risks faced by the group and assesses 
their likelihood and impact; and
 z identifies the processes and controls in place to mitigate 
these risks.the group has its own football, cricket and netball teams that 
play regularly, and organises cycling events encouraging mass 
employee and business participation.that director will not then be involved in the 
discussions relating to the proposal, transaction, contract or 
arrangement in which they have an interest, unless agreed 
otherwise by the directors of the company in the limited 
circumstance specified in the articles of association, nor will 
they be counted in the quorum or be permitted to vote on any 
issue in which they have an interest.the table below sets out the current position of the company 
on a gender basis: 
given the relatively small size of the board, it would not seem 
appropriate to impose specific formulaic gender or diversity 
targets but it is the company’s intention to increase the gender 
and ethnic diversity of the board and senior management team 
as opportunities arise.a number of recommendations were made, 
including the creation of an internal audit function by the 
audit committee, the initiation of a process to provide for 
the remuneration committee chair succession by the 
remuneration committee.the board sets the tone of the company’s values and ethical 
standards and manages the business in a manner to meet its 
obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders.the committee 
challenged management to provide the rationale for the 
treatment of certain costs as exceptional.during the current year review, the committee has decided 
to enhance the procedure by appointing an independent third 
party reporting agent to be the first point of contact for those 
who do not wish to use normal internal line management 
channels for reporting their concerns.the group increased its capability to 
detect and react to potential incidents to 
ensure it keeps up with the ever  
evolving cyber threat landscape

members to the committee on the recommendation of the 
nomination committee and in consultation with the chairman 
of the committee.this reflects the approach for other staff and prevents non-
executive fees getting significantly out of line with market, 
which could be a limiting factor to the attraction of new non-
executive director candidates and could also result in large, 
albeit irregular, adjustments.sign-on bonuses are not generally offered 
by ncc group but at board level, the committee may offer 
additional cash and/or share based ‘buyout’ awards when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the company 
and, therefore, shareholders, including awards made under 
listing rule 9.4.2 r. any such ‘buyout’ payments would be 
based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former 
employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism such 
as cash, shares, options, time horizons and performance 
requirements attaching to that remuneration.payments on 
termination for executive directors are restricted to the value 
of salary and contractual benefits for the duration of the notice 
period.statement of consideration of employment

with employees when determining remuneration policy for
