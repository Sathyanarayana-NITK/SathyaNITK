• completed the acquisition of the 
brits vanadium project from sable 
metals limited.the acquisition of the brits vanadium project 
presents significant opportunities to significantly 
increase the company’s resource base, while the 
existence of several additional brownfield assets 
in south africa in close proximity to the 
company’s vanadium deposits creates low cost 
and quicker opportunities for scale up.• the largest primary vanadium platform means 
having the largest high-grade primary vanadium 
resource base and the largest primary vanadium 
production in the world;
executing on  
our strategy to 
deliver growth
“ the acquisition consideration of us$16.47 
million represents less than 10% of the 
replacement value of vametco and the strong 
cash flow generating ability of the underlying 
operations enabled the acquisition to be largely 
debt-funded (us$14.0million).”

position on the vanadium production cost curve, 
leveraging the high in-situ and in-magnetite v

grades and the open-cast mining proposition of 
bushveld minerals’ deposits as well as access to 
low-cost brownfield processing infrastructure;
• the most vertically integrated primary vanadium 
platform means development of downstream 
operations beyond production of end-use 
vanadium products to also include development 
and deployment of vanadium applications in 
industries such as the energy storage market, 
where bushveld intends to manufacture 
vanadium electrolyte and to build large-scale 
vanadium based vrfbs.since 
the signing of this mou, lemur has led a delegation 
to madagascar intended, among other things, to  
help identify the optimal site for the power plant.bushveld minerals continues to make strides in 
developing its projects across all its three platforms 
in spite of the constrained operating environment.bushveld minerals believes the mokopane 
vanadium project is robust enough to advance to a 
bankable feasibility study.vametco owns the new order minerals rights for 
vanadium and other associated minerals over 
portion 1 of the farm uitvalgrond 431 jq and portion 
1 of the farm krokodilkraal 426 jq in brits.citigroup estimates that the energy storage  
market will be greater than us$350 billion by 2030. 
according to the energy storage association,  
the us market alone grew by 280mw in 2016 and  
is expected to reach nearly 500mw in 2017 and  
over 1,600mw by 2020. the deployment of energy 
storage systems through 2017 looks set for 
exponential growth.the results of the test work 
included expected recovery using gravity 
concentration of over 70% for grind sizes of -1mm 
and achieved commercial concentrate grade of 
74.59% sno

is coarse and may be liberated as relatively large 
particle sizes (over 250 µm), and that 
classification of the ore into various size fractions 
could improve recovery efficiency in the plant.24

furthermore, lemur is in discussions to appoint  
an owner engineering team to guide the various 
studies that constitute part of the bfs for the  
power project to be jointly funded with sinohydro.on the mining side, the company is in discussions 
with a number of mining and mine services 
companies regarding strategic partnerships  
in contract mining and coal processing services.the pq phosphate project
the pq phosphate project immediately 
overlies the iron ore and titanium resource  
of the pq project.employee involvement policies 
the group places considerable value on the awareness and involvement of its employees in the group’s exploration and development activities.the directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the group’s website.the key elements of the group’s corporate governance are as follows:
• the group board will conduct a review (at least annually) of the effectiveness of the group’s systems of internal controls.the group board has taken professional international tax advice as to maintaining the tax residency of the company in guernsey.• on 20 march 2012, geoff sproule entered into a service agreement with the company under the terms of which he agreed to act as the chief financial officer.the lemur subsidiaries are coal project development companies.following the adoption of these standards there has been no change to the group accounting policies and there has been no material impact on the financial 
statements of the group.accounting standards and interpretations not applied
standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the group:
amendments to ifrs 2: classification 
and measurement of share-based 
payment transactions*
1 january 2018 amendments to provide requirements on the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting 
conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments, share-based payment 
transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations, and a modification  
to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the 
transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled.if an exploration project is successful, the related expenditures will be transferred at cost to property, plant and equipment and amortised over the estimated life  
of the commercial ore reserves on a unit of production basis (with this charge being taken through profit or loss).the recoverability of deferred exploration costs is dependent upon the discovery of economically viable ore reserves, the ability of the group to obtain necessary 
financing to complete the development of ore reserves and future profitable production or proceeds from the extraction or disposal thereof.44

4. segmental reporting
the reporting segments are identified by the directors of the group (who are considered to be the chief operating decision-makers) by the way that group’s 
operations are organised.during the year the company issued a total of 53,571,430 new ordinary shares at a price of 1.4 pence per share raising gross proceeds of £750,000.foreign exchange risk
as highlighted earlier in these financial statements, the functional currency of the group is pound sterling.the investment is in line with bushveld’s stated strategy to develop a significant, vertically integrated vanadium platform and accelerate the path to production  
by several years.the mou’s objectives include:
• development of a bankable feasibility study (“bfs”) and a project implementation proposal for the project by sinohydro, at its own cost, within 12 months  
of signing the mou;
• preparation by both parties of an environmental impact assessment for the project;
• preparation by both parties of epc and o&m contracts for the ipp plant and the epc contract for the transmission line within 18 months;
• cooperation between the two parties to secure both debt and equity funding for the project;
• potential establishment of a future company for the project upon completion of the bfs, in which sinohydro’s parent company, powerchina, may take an 
equity interest; and
• lemur will continue the development of its asset in order to supply coal to the imaloto ipp .uis tin project
the uis tin project is one of the largest undeveloped opencast hard rock tin deposits in the world and has a history of significant tin mining and an estimated 70.3mt 
non-jorc resource at 0.14% sn for a total potential resource of over 90kt of contained tin.
