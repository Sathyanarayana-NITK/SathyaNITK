the board 
sees this as a way of bringing fresh impetus to these offices and 
freeing the board to focus on the group’s franchising operations.accounting apprentice catalyn wins two local awards
in 2017 accounting apprentice catalyn bavister, who works in the 
belvoir group finance department, won both the grantham college 
advanced accounting apprentice of the year award and the 
grantham journal apprentice of the year award.looking at the demographic detail behind this trend, those in 
the age groups of 25–34 and 35–44 seem to be the biggest cause 
of this shift.the housing market and how 
we are responding to it
with a lack of affordable housing and average wages down 
in real terms, the private rented sector (prs) continues to grow 
as households decide to rent rather than buy.increased regulation for landlords can only help to make the prs 
a more reliable sector for tenants.based on their assessment of prospects and viability above, the 
directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due.the board continually monitors the performance of 
the recruitment team and is focused on identifying 
innovative ways of attracting successful new 
franchise owners.this, together with the £1.4m 
opening cash balance, will enable the group to meet the bank 
loan repayment of £0.7m in 2018. also, the capital repayments 
from the existing franchisee loan book will enable the group to 
give further financial assistance to franchisees acquiring local 
managed lettings portfolios, which delivers both network growth 
and favourable rates of return for the group.since the acquisitions of newton fallowell, 
goodchilds and northwood, all of which were already offering 
sales to varying degrees, and given that the penetration of sales 
within the belvoir network is now up to over 60%, the number of 
offices offering property sales is no longer deemed to be a key 
determinant of future growth.liquidity and capital resources
at the year end the group had cash balances of £1.4m (2016: £1.6m) 
and a term loan of £6.5m (2016: £7.0m).the board has decided that, given the nature of the company’s 
business and assets and the overall size of the company, the 
systems and procedures currently employed provide sufficient 
assurance that a sound system of internal control, which 
safeguards shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets, 
is in place.the performance of the group is reported monthly and 
compared to the latest forecast and the prior period.these 
fees are to be determined by the committee without the involvement 
of the non-executive director concerned.basic salary or fees
basic salary or fees for each director are reviewed annually by the 
remuneration committee, taking into account the performance 
of the individual and information from independent sources on 
the rates of salary for similar posts.furthermore, the board is pursuing strategic growth as a multi-brand 
franchising group through the acquisition of other franchised networks, 
building on the group’s strength as a highly regarded franchisor 
within the residential property sales and lettings sector.independent auditor

opinion
in our opinion, belvoir lettings plc’s group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 ∞ give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 december 2017 and of the group’s 
profit and the group’s and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 ∞ have been properly prepared in accordance with ifrs as adopted by the european union and, as regards the parent company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006; and
 ∞ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies act 2006.

the group and parent company statements of financial position as at 31 december 2017; the group statement of comprehensive income, 
the group and parent company statements of cash flows, and the group and parent company statements of changes in equity for the

refer to the significant judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in note 1 to the accounts.costs relating to the acquisition of brook financial services 
limited, the aborted merger with the property franchise group 
and the restructuring of the group have been separately 
disclosed as exceptional items.34 belvoir lettings plc annual report and accounts 2017

our audit approach continued
how we tailored the audit scope continued
in establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we identified three legal entities: belvoir property management (uk) limited, 
northwood gb limited and newton fallowell limited, which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due 
to their financial significance to the group.the audits of these nine legal entities, together with the additional procedures performed at the group level, including over the group 
consolidation, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole.the directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.there are no material 
uncertainties, of which directors are aware, that may cast doubt on the group and company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
by reference to the guidance issued by the financial reporting council on going concern assessment.the standard replaces ias 18, revenue and related interpretations and is 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. the group has carried out a review of existing contractual arrangements 
as part of this process to identify the customer contracts, the performance obligations, the transaction price and when the performance 
obligation is satisfied.deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
and their tax bases.such renegotiations 
will lead to changes in the timing of payments rather than changes to the amounts owed and, in consequence, where material the new 
expected cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate.the fair value so determined is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.equity
equity comprises the following:
 ∞ share capital represents the nominal value of equity share;
 ∞ share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for shares, net of expenses of the share issue;
 ∞ share-based payments reserve represents the reserve arising from the fair value of the share options charge;
 ∞ revaluation reserve represents the accumulated net surplus on revaluation of freehold property;
 ∞ merger reserve represents the reserve arising in the group and company accounts following the application of merger accounting 
in the treatment of the reorganisation and flotation of the group and company; and
 ∞ retained earnings represents retained profits and losses.recoverability of franchise debtors
the recoverability of loans to franchisees is assessed by management and where in doubt a specific provision is booked.exceptional non-recurring items
certain items are judged by management to be of an exceptional non-recurring nature and as such are reported separately 
as exceptional items.adjusted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share are calculated in the same way but having adjusted the profit for 
the year for exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles and the share-based payment charge.during the year, emoluments were paid to three persons each related to different directors of £76,177 (2016: £73,452), £nil (2016: £2,874) 
and £170 (2016: £nil).
