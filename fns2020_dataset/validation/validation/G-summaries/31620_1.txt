the leadership team was 
further strengthened during the year and 
the business undertook a consolidation to a 
single location in order to generate additional 
efficiencies going forward.with a 
number of developing sales prospects, active 
pilot projects and strengthening partnerships 
with existing customers, the digital retail 
business is well-positioned to take advantage 
of the growth in this market.traceability of ingredients through the 
supply chain and compliance with the latest 
regulatory standards are key requirements 
for food and drink businesses and are strong 
features of the group’s solution.the group continues to invest in product 
development to ensure the solutions 
marketed by sanderson remain modern and 
competitive, whilst at the same time adopting 
a conservative accounting policy in respect 
of the treatment of such development 
expenditure that ensures a significant 
proportion of the annual development 
spend is expensed in line with revenues 
generated.the regular monitoring of order intake 
is an important indicator of likely trading 
performance in the short-term as well as 
providing an indication as to confidence 
levels within the customer community.care is the highest priority for 
staff at the centre, so marketing often slips 
to the bottom of the pile, despite being so 
important for reaching eligible children as 
well as attracting donations.in addition, all shareholders are welcome to attend the annual 
general meeting, where there is an opportunity to question the directors as part of the agenda, or more informally after the meeting.under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss of the company and the group for the period.we have audited the financial statements of sanderson group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year 
ended 30 september 2017 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and company statements of financial position, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated 
and company cash flow statements and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.revenue is a key driver of the business and judgement 
is involved in determining when contractual obligations 
have been performed and to the extent that the right to 
consideration has been earned.auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.annual report and accounts

are met, as described more fully in the accounting policy on the treatment of research and development expenditure.with regard to ifrs 15 and ifrs 16, the group has

be material to the group’s reported results or financial position.basis of consolidation

statement of financial position date.the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity.the amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options 
expected to vest.deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying tax loss or deductible temporary difference will be 
able to be utilised against future taxable income.^  performance conditions relating to options issued to certain managers at one iota limited are based on target profitability and are in line with the conditions 
relating to the measurement and payment of deferred conditional consideration payable to the former shareholders of the business.the directors will receive a proportion of this dividend by virtue of their shareholdings in the 
company, details of which are disclosed in the directors’ report.annual report and accounts
