principal risks and uncertainties 
continued compliance and controls
description and impact
the management of agency relationships 
represents one of the largest risks of 
reputational damage that companies face.as part of the risk review process, sanctions implications are reviewed with the business and 
specialised external counsel before entering any territory that may be impacted.exceptional items and certain  
re-measurements in the engineering  
& production services division totalled 
us$22 million after tax (2016: us$4 million; 
see note 5 to the consolidated financial 
statements), primarily in relation to an 
onerous leasehold property provision  
of us$12 million (post-tax) and office 
closure and redundancy costs of  
us$4m (post-tax).in line with 
prior years, the effective tax rate is also driven by tax laws in the 
jurisdictions where the group operates and generates profits.in 2017 , us$5,000 of this was presented  
to the rumah safiyyah children’s shelter  
to support various road and fire safety 
education programmes in conjunction  
with the local malaysian fire and  
rescue department.this was prompted by the 2016 media 
allegations relating to the historical provision 
of services to the company by unaoil.individual reports from each committee 
chairman for 2017 are provided on pages  
80 to 105.
in addition to these board committees,  
the company has a number of executive 
management committees, which are 
involved in the day-to-day operational 
management of petrofac and have been 
established to consider various matters  
for recommendation to the board and  
its committees.the chairman and sid maintain 
regular contact between scheduled board 
meetings and time is also set aside at each 
meeting for the chairman to meet with the 
non-executive directors without the 
presence of management.during their  
trips to india and aberdeen in 2017 , the 
non-executive directors were given the 
opportunity to meet graduates and 
employees considered to be ‘emerging 
talent’, thereby providing them with the 
chance to speak with individuals who  
they would not ordinarily encounter.as mentioned on page 74, to deepen 
directors’ understanding and knowledge of 
petrofac and its operations, the board 
undertook site visits to our chennai, 
mumbai and aberdeen offices during the 
year.improvement areas identified
in addition to considering the results of this 
year’s evaluation, the directors reviewed 
progress against the targets previously 
identified where the board might improve  
and these are set out below:
strategy: plan “deep dives” into key 
areas to help to define and determine a 
more focused strategic agenda.petrofac is responding as constructively  
as possible to the sfo investigation,  
noting that the sfo also has access to 
other information in the context of its wider 
investigation.in addition, focus will continue to ensure that the 
provisions of the uk code continue to be met in all aspects.the group has an internal control and risk management 
framework in place, which includes policies and procedures to 
ensure that adequate accounting records are maintained and 
transactions are accurately recorded.the krr is considered at both committee and 
board level throughout the year and further details are included 
within the strategic report on pages 26 to 33.
regular management reports support robust assessments of  
the principal risks facing the group, including their impacts on  
the enterprise and its future sustainability.in order to provide its 
assurance to the board, the committee receives regular updates 
from the group head of enterprise risk, group head of internal 
audit, group financial controller, group treasurer and head of 
tax and group head of compliance.it was satisfied 
with the report from management that following completion of a 
number of scenarios, the company had adequate resources in 
place to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
with robust policies in place to manage group solvency and 
liquidity risks.the company’s compliance portal is at the centre of the 
compliance programme and is an essential tool for the ongoing 
scrutiny of third-parties through risk-based due diligence.this will further enhance the 
committee’s ability to monitor and measure compliance 
implementation at both group and project levels, and for a 
scorecard of measurable kpis to be created and reviewed  
at each committee meeting.the policy for executive directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and 
principles that underpin remuneration for the wider group and all reward arrangements are built around common objectives  
and principles.responsibility statement under the disclosure  
guidance and transparency rules
each of the directors listed on pages 68 and 69 confirms that,  
to the best of their knowledge:
• the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with ifrs, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the strategic report contained on pages 2 to 65 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.we analysed contingency movements 
throughout the life of the contract, and discussed progress to 
date and identified risks and challenges on contracts with 
individual project directors to determine whether the 
remaining contingency was sufficient to cover residual risks 
on the project.of the remaining components that together represent 10% of the group’s 
adjusted pbt, none are individually greater than 1% of the group’s 
adjusted pbt.the group has determined that, due to a change in the loss allowance 
recognition from an incurred loss model to an expected credit loss model 
and the impairment requirements under ifrs 9 being applied for the first 
time to its retention receivables and work-in-progress balances, the initial 
application of the standard will not have a material impact on the opening 
retained earnings at 1 january 2018.
hedge accounting
the group has determined that all existing hedge relationships that are 
currently designated in effective hedging relationships will continue to 
qualify for hedge accounting under ifrs 9. the group has chosen not to 
retrospectively apply ifrs 9 on transition to the hedges where the group 
excluded the forward points from the hedge designation under ias 39. as 
ifrs 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts 
for effective hedges, applying the hedging requirements of ifrs 9 will not 
have a significant impact on the group’s financial statements.the group plans to adopt the new standard on 1 january 2018 using the 
modified retrospective method.it is therefore 
appropriate to combine the services into a single performance 
obligation which is consistent with the current accounting treatment
• services are satisfied over time given that the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits provided by the group.the group 
currently capitalises pre-contract/bid costs, where such costs are 
incremental to the contract and are expected to be recovered, as an 
asset and will expense it over the life of the contract.many of the disclosure requirements in ifrs 15 are new  
and the group has assessed that the impact of some of these disclosure 
requirements will be significant.the psc was treated as a joint operation since contractually all the 
decisions concerning the relevant activities of the unincorporated joint arrangement require unanimous consent of the joint arrangement partners.– 1
