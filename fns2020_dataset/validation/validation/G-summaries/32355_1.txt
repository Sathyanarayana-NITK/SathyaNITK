learning from last summer, we have been working closely with 
airlines, airports and the caa over the winter to assess demand across 
the	uk	airspace	network	and	to	develop	a	strategy	to	minimise	delay 
this summer.in assessing the carrying value of goodwill, consideration is also given to 
opportunities to outperform regulatory settlements and any premium a 
purchaser would be willing to pay for a controlling interest, by reference 
to	the	projected	financial	return	indicated	by	the	company’s	business	
plan	and	recent	uk	and	european	market	transactions	in	utilities	and	
airport operators.this	is	lower	than	the	headline	rate	of	20%,	mainly	reflecting	the	deferred	
tax	impact	of	the	reduction	in	the	corporation	tax	rate	to	17%	from	april 	
2020 and the lower tax rate on patent box income.during	the	year	the	company	paid	uk	corporation	
tax of £16.3m (2016: £29.8m) and foreign tax of £0.1m (2016: £0.6m).defence represents the provision of atc and related engineering support and

the nats business, presentations from relevant executive management,

different basis of valuation for the trustees funding assessment and for 
the balance sheet position under international accounting standards.the committee also considered cyber security risks including the 
establishment	of	an	executive	management	committee	supported	by	
independent advice which will assist all the board’s committee’s in their 
understanding and governance of cyber security aspects across all of 
nats’ top risks.main	activities	of	the	committee

normally	vest	in	three	tranches,	50%	in	the	third	financial	year,	25%	in	
the	fourth	financial	year	and	25%	in	the	fifth	financial	year.through regular review of the strategy, and progress of 
the detailed cyber plan, the committee has assured that a high level 
of protection of people, data, infrastructure and operations has been 
maintained and that nats has an active security management system.the key aspects of the revised airspace 
programme	during	rp2	are	identified	below:
 > delivery	of	a	‘point	merge’	approach	system	for	london	city	airport	
and a number of related changes completed in february 2016;
 > the redesign of certain aspects of the london area control operation 
to optimise performance and reduce emissions/fuel usage;
 > a single vehicle to develop and deliver consistent and systemised 
airspace in the north of england and scotland through the prestwick 
lower airspace project;
 > the	delivery	of	free	route	airspace,	where	traffic	will	not	be	
constrained	by	existing	route	structures	and	will	be	able	to	fly	user-
preferred direct routes across large swathes of airspace to optimise
