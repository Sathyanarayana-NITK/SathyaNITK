potential impact
— customer acquisition and retention could fall.mitigating activities
— the group reports its results in us dollars, minimising currency impact on reported revenue, operating profit and net assets since trading 
operations are concentrated largely in north america.potential impact
— inability to fulfil customer orders would lead to lost revenue and a negative impact on customer acquisition and retention statistics.items of 
special business to be considered at the meeting are described in 
detail in the notice of the agm and the notes on the business to be 
conducted.based on the results of 
this analysis, the board has a reasonable expectation that the group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three year period of their assessment.the board considers it important to understand the views of 
shareholders, in particular, any issues which concern them.the company supports the code provision that boards should 
consider the benefits of diversity, including gender, when making 
appointments and is committed to ensuring diversity, not just at 
board level, but also across the company’s senior management, not 
least because it believes that the business benefits from the widest 
range of perspectives and backgrounds.it aids the 
board in seeking to ensure that the financial and non-financial 
information supplied to shareholders presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the group’s performance and 
position.during the period, the audit committee formally reviewed draft 
interim and annual reports and associated interim and year end 
results announcements.financial statements
the committee considered, and was satisfied, with management’s 
presentation of the financial statements for the period ended 
30 december 2017 and, in particular, the presentation of certain 
items as exceptional items.the 
current audit partner was first appointed in respect of the 2015 
financial period ended 2 january 2016.
taking into consideration the external auditors’ knowledge of the 
group and level of experience, the audit committee has 
recommended to the board that the external auditors are 
reappointed for the period ending 29 december 2018.
given the present structure of the group, the board does not 
currently consider the establishment of a separate internal audit 
function to be necessary.the plan is directly linked to the annual bonus of senior 
employees.the number of nil cost options or conditional share awards will be 
determined by dividing the amount of the annual bonus being 
deferred by the price of a share on 31 december of the year 
preceding that in which the awards are made.for example, for 
awards made in 2017, the share price used in the determination was 
that on 31 december 2016.
in respect of the period ended 30 december 2017, the remuneration 
committee has approved an annual bonus for those participating in 
the plan equal to 50% of base salary in respect of the beneficiaries 
based in north america and 30% of base salary in respect of the 
beneficiary based in the uk.other than in exceptional circumstances, any deferred awards will 
not vest earlier than three years from the date of the grant of the nil 
cost option or award of conditional shares and such vesting will be 
conditional on the beneficiary being in employment for that period.the plan contains “malus” provisions such that if, prior to the date 
on which an award vests, the annual bonus from which it was 
determined is found to be incorrect as a result of either a material 
misstatement in the audited accounts of the group or the conduct 
of a beneficiary amounting to fraud or gross misconduct, then the 
board may reduce, to nil, the number of shares awarded.the targets for the annual bonus, which is capped at a maximum of 
100% of annual base salary, except in the case of the remaining 
uk-based executive director, where the maximum is 50%, are set by 
the remuneration committee each year and evolve with the growth 
objectives of the group.this section describes the remuneration policy, which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 annual general meeting, will take effect 
from 8 may 2018 and will be effective until the annual general meeting held in 2021, unless a further policy is proposed by the company 
and approved by shareholders in the meantime.application base salaries are considered against those paid in organisations of similar size, complexity and type in order to 
attract and retain the required quality of executives to deliver the board’s strategy.scull (the “uk-based executive director”) has a rolling service contract which continues until terminated by the expiry of twelve 
months’ written notice from the company to the director.the directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the company’s website.there are inherent 
limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events 
and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.strategic report and directors’ report
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the strategic report and directors’ report 
for the period ended 30 december 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements.(ca06)
the directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the group
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
— the directors’ confirmation on page 32 of the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.a substantial 
portion of the group’s revenue and earnings are denominated in us dollars and the board is of the opinion that a us dollar presentation 
gives a more meaningful view of the group’s financial performance and position.accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.61
