nex data
nex data delivers independent market intelligence and price information  
for otc data to financial market participants from information received from 
nex markets and third parties.matched principal trade receivables and 
payables as at 31 march 2016 have been restated as a result of the change 
in accounting policy.in 
accordance with the articles of association of nex, she  
is expected to stand for appointment at the annual 
general meeting in july.throughout the year, more than half the board, excluding the chairman, 
comprised independent non-executive directors.the balance of the 
board as at 31 march 2017 is illustrated below.further details of the 
group’s executive committee structure and gemg members are provided 
on pages 50 and 51. a summary of the board members’ key responsibilities 
is set out below.in order to ensure board composition and business 
oversight remain effective throughout the group, all subsidiary board 
appointments will require the committee’s prior approval going forward, 
including an assessment of the value and experience which each nominated 
board member will bring to the board.the committee reviewed management’s 
assessments and discussed the appropriateness of management’s 
estimates with the external auditor.the effectiveness of the 
internal control system is reviewed regularly by the internal audit function.no changes to the articles of association  
of the company will be proposed at the 2017 annual general meeting.as at 31 march 2017 , the nex trust held 7 ,457 ,286 ordinary shares.going concern
the group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the strategic 
report.it is now the view of the committee that the design and 
implementation phases of this work are complete, and that the framework 
is sufficiently well embedded in the business to be considered ‘business as 
usual’.the profit before tax and eps measures under the annual bonus and psp incentivise the achievement of continuing financial growth, with the tsr measure 
providing a direct link to the creation of shareholder value.in determining whether to award a bonus, the committee will assess performance during the financial year and apply 
pro rata as deemed appropriate.the committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the group when determining remuneration arrangements for 
executive directors.nex manages the costs of employment at the corporate level and expects changes in total remuneration for directors to reflect 
changes in the company’s performance.the company also has clarity on its culture going forward, and the dissemination of this 
throughout the business is ongoing.68 nex group plc annual report 2017 strategic report governance and directors’ report financial statements definitions

other required reporting
consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
companies act 2006 reporting
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.this report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the 
companies act 2006 and for no other purpose.the consolidated income statement for the comparative periods is restated to show the 
discontinued operations separate from those generated by the continuing operations.a change of ownership that does not result in a loss of control is classified as  
an equity transaction, with the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is recorded and the fair value of the consideration 
received recognised directly in equity.on consolidation, the accounting policies of group companies (the company and its subsidiaries) are consistent with those applied by the group.** given that the group’s debt financing arrangements are managed centrally through a treasury function, the board of nex group plc does not incorporate net finance cost in the assessment of the segments’ 
performance, therefore this is presented on a total group basis.the key component of the 
development costs is compensation of employees.this process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management; if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet 
expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.it is not possible to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities, but there are none currently expected to have  
a material impact on the group’s consolidated results or net assets.the amount of the impairment 
is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.as at 31 march 2017 the following continuing other trade receivables were past due but not impaired.the fair value of these 
assets and liabilities is not materially different from their book values.the group received £2m (2015/16: £3m) during the year and as at 31 march 2017 , 
the total outstanding balance due from the group was £1m (2015/16: £4m).
