materials and through clearer allocation and management of the board’s time in disciplined discussions;
• further promote focused debate at the board by operating an annual strategic agenda in which the directors will 
input, ensuring that each meeting considers key strategic issues at the most appropriate junctures, alongside the 
normal requirements of the quarterly reporting cycle;
• support the nomination committee in crystallising and planning for future board and committee rotation, 
including scoping and clarifying specifications for key roles, in accordance with the provisions of the code; and
• continue working closely with management and the company’s advisers, to ensure that wider shareholder 
sentiment on company matters is fully explored, understood and weighed.risk management and internal controls

opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
2. our assessment of risks of material misstatement
in arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (the risk related to the carrying 
value of intangible assets and goodwill noted in our prior year audit opinion has been removed as we no longer 
considered this risk to be one of those having the greatest effect on our audit given the group’s cash generation  
and trading performance in the year and forecast growth):
