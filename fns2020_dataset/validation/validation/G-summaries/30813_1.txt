new stores increase the visibility of the 
brand, improve customer service (as 
discussed above) and grow the top line, 
swelling the brand budget further.this, combined 
with the weaker trading witnessed in the 
early months of 2017, informed our value 
for money communications strategy 
outlined above.technology
our investment in technology serves two main 
purposes – to make constant improvements to 
the customer ordering experience, and to help 
franchisees maximise their own operating 
efficiency.during the year we 
invested £36.6m in buying our own 
shares, at an average price of 339.9p.however, the company’s articles of 
association allow the board to “authorise” 
conflicts, where felt appropriate.in addition, 
our brokers are invited to provide an 
independent view on matters of strategic 
importance such as potential acquisitions 
and share buybacks.•

share capital continued
there are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the company other 
than certain restrictions that may be 
imposed from time to time by the articles, 
law or regulation and pursuant to the 
listing rules whereby certain directors, 
officers and employees require approval 
to deal in ordinary shares of the company.the group does not have agreements 
with any director or employee that would 
provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover 
except that provisions of the group’s employee 
share schemes may cause options and 
awards granted to employees, including 
directors, to vest on a change of control.the key assumptions included:
 •
discount rates
 •
medium-term growth rates
in respect of the discount rates, an independent assessment 
was made based on general market indicators.changes from the prior year 
as a result of the acquisitions made during 
the period, we have designated two of 
these locations as specific scope and two 
of these locations as review scope.for the six specific scope components, 
where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable 
us to determine that sufficient audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the group as a whole.the company is domiciled in the 
united kingdom and its registered address is 1 thornbury, west ashland, milton keynes mk6 4bb.the group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (‘ifrss’) as adopted 
by the european union as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the period ended 31 december 2017.
the principal accounting policies adopted by the group are set out in note 2.to support this presumption and when the group has 
less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing 
whether it has power over an investee, including:
 •
the contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders the investee;
 •
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
 •
the group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.the foreign exchange gains or losses on the group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture are reflected in the statement of 
other comprehensive income.exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and are taken directly to a translation reserve.national advertising fund
in addition to franchise fees, franchisees pay contributions which are collected by the group for specific use within the national advertising 
fund.had the principles of ifrs 15 been applied in the current reporting period, it would not have had a significant impact on the 
financial statements.the standard will also impact a number of statutory measures such as operating profit and cash generated from operations, and alternative 
performance measures used by the group.management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment.in addition, trade receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not 
significant.the acquisition 
provides access to the west london area through the standard franchise agreement (‘sfa’), and the growth opportunities available in this market.basis of preparation
these financial statements were prepared in accordance with frs 101 reduced disclosure framework and the companies act 2006. the 
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value.the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award.
