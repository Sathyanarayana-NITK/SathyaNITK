technology may also 
have an increasing role in distribution 
and client services, for example by 
enabling precisely targeted marketing 
and messages to specific intermediaries, 
and providing digital services that allow 
advisers to self‑ serve and find answers 
to their common questions.in 
advance of the expected brexit date 
in early 2019, we expect the 
management company activities for 
the sicav will need to take place 
within a legal entity domiciled in 
europe as we expect that, post brexit, 
this will not be possible from the uk.our significant 
investment in 2017 will, over time, deliver 
efficiencies and more operating scale, 
facilitating further growth through a 
standardised approach to running the 
platform.we balance this with 
bringing in new people with specialist 
skills, giving us strength and depth 
as well as enabling us to expand the 
breadth of investment strategies we offer.risk 19

there is a risk that our clients will not 
meet their investment objectives, due to 
poor relative performance by one or 
more of our funds over a prolonged 
period.this could result in 
clients not receiving their desired 
investment outcomes, outflows from 
jupiter (and the related decline in 
revenues) and a failure to attract new 
business and thus not meet our 
strategic growth objectives.it has also streamlined the 
sharing of data across business functions, 
which helps us to make well‑ informed 
decisions that ultimately benefit our 
clients.available profit measures are 
also used to illustrate the relative 
distribution of profit between staff and 
shareholders (see pages 26 and 27).as part of our approach to stewardship 
and responsible investment, we review 
key themes that could affect the long‑ term value of companies.during the year, the 
non‑ executive directors’ letters of 
appointment were reviewed.when authorising conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest, the director 
concerned may not take part in the 
board’s decision‑ making.board and board 
committee evaluations
in accordance with the code, 
independent board evaluation (ibe), 
an external consultancy with no other 
connection to the company, conducted 
an external evaluation exercise during 
the summer of 2017, the results of which 
are shown below.the committee’s members
lorraine trainer, jonathon bond and  
karl sternberg served with me on the 
committee throughout the year.these include anticipated 
levels of vesting, once leaver rates 
and performance conditions are 
factored in, and for the option 
plans, the timings of exercises
the committee reviewed the 
assumptions in leaver rates, 
the likely vesting levels 
following performance 
condition testing and timings 
of exercises
the committee confirmed the 
assumptions suggested by the finance 
function, based on historical data, the 
company’s business plan and factoring 
in known changes such as forfeitures
goodwill the company has £341.2m of 
goodwill on its balance sheet,

the committee was asked to

appropriate
a full impairment test was undertaken 
and demonstrated that there was 
significant headroom available.the remuneration 
structure in the proposed new policy will 
align more closely with this objective by 
increasing focus on long‑ term results 
through a number of changes.l l future long term incentive plan (‘ltip’) 
awards granted to executive directors 
will be subject to a two‑ year post‑ vesting holding period, bringing the 
total timescale for awards to five 
years.executive directors’ illustrative pay scenarios (£m)

the illustrative pay scenario charts above are not directly comparable with the numbers from the single figure table on page 
72. this graph illustrates the grant value of ltip awards, discounted by the expected level of payout under a below ‘threshold’, 
‘mid‑ range’ or ‘maximum’ performance scenario.at the beginning of each performance year, the committee 
agrees a range of targets for each metric.the value of other benefits will vary 
year‑ on‑ year, depending on factors such as the third party 
provider charges and market conditions.the 
overall outcome is not formulaic; the committee applies a level 
of judgement to ensure the pay‑ out levels reflect both individual 
performance and the experience of shareholders for the year.this 
considers the accounting treatment for 
the pool and resulting variable 
compensation expense to be recognised 
in 2017. as illustrated in the graphic 
below, the variable compensation 
expense is determined by the nature and 
extent of bonus awarded in 2017 as well 
as deferred awards (including ltip) 
made in prior years.the national insurance 
charge relating to share based 
compensation is impacted by movements 
in the jupiter share price.combined, these 
adjustments have various implications on 
jupiter’s variable compensation expense 
and are explained further in the financial 
review section on page 28.
under the new policy, in future years the 
remuneration committee will increase its 
focus on the variable and total 
compensation ratios in determining 
variable compensation spend.1 
available profit, adjusted available profit, variable 
compensation ratio, total compensation ratio, 
underlying eps and adjusted ebitda are all underlying 
performance measures defined on page 31.

£155m £182m £210m £197m profitability (as measured by adjusted 
ebitda) has increased 15% relative to the 
prior year, and is 8% ahead of the budget.we now have 
strong distribution partnerships with large institutions in much 
of continental europe, where, in some cases, we did not have 
any relationship at all three years ago.l l the group’s environmental 
performance data, including the 
absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions for 
2017, can be found in the corporate 
responsibility section of the strategic 
report.the directors are advised of their 
statutory duty to avoid conflicts of 
interest with those of the company.statement of viability
in accordance with provision c.2.2 of the 
code, the directors have assessed the 
prospects of the group over a longer 
period than the 12 months required by 
the going concern provision.change of control
the company does not have 
agreements with any director or 
employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a change of 
control following a takeover bid, except 
that provisions of the company’s share 
schemes may cause options and awards 
granted under such schemes to vest in 
those circumstances.the directors’ responsibility 
for accounting records
the directors have examined the 
accounting records kept in the business 
and have determined that they are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company 
and the group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and 
the directors’ remuneration report 
comply with the requirements of the act 
and, as regards the group financial 
statements, article 4 of the ias 
regulation.all financial, business and strategic 
decisions are made centrally by the board of directors (the board), which determines the key performance indicators of the 
group.our implementation efforts included the 
identification of all material revenue sources, including management and performance fees, upfront fees and also upfront 
revenue‑ related costs.
