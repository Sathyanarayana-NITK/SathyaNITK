the building contracting division and engineering division in 
2005 and 2006. the activity of this division is now limited to 
the resolution of contractual claims.the gross profit of gleeson homes increased by 18.9% to 
£42.1m (2016: £35.4m) due to the increase in volume, 
completion of the final low margin legacy site, a small 
increase in selling prices and the profit on land sales.the risk appears to be increasing with 
certain sub-contractors becoming more 
difficult to attract in some areas.the 
directors believe that the code is correctly applied as and 
where relevant to the company and are satisfied that in areas 
of departure from the code the departure is for good reason.dermot gleeson has been connected with the company for 
a long period and the board greatly values his experience of 
the group.the board selects at least three of its directors to act as a

in the selection of candidates is fully aware of the uk’s

governance statement
the disclosure guidance and transparency rules require 
certain information to be included in a governance 
statement in the directors’ report.the board 
may also refuse to register any transfer of certificated 
shares unless it is:
• in respect of only one class of shares;
• in favour of no more than four transferees;
• duly stamped or exempt from stamp duty;
• delivered to the office or at such other place as the board 
may decide for registration; and
• accompanied by the certificate for the shares to be 
transferred and such other evidence (if any) as the board 
may reasonably require to show the right of the intending 
transferor to transfer the shares.the committee satisfied itself, and subsequently the board, 
that the going concern basis of preparation continues to 
be appropriate in the context of the group’s funding and 
liquidity position.the committee monitors the effectiveness of internal 
controls exercised over the key processes employed by the 
group in site development activities and the forecasting of 
future costs, revenues and profits.the results of this are reviewed by the 
committee and risks identified are incorporated into the 
group risk register.the committee has satisfied itself that an appropriate 
system of internal controls and risk management processes 
have been maintained throughout the year to safeguard 
shareholder interests as well as the group’s assets in 
accordance with the principle c2 of the code.components of directors’ remuneration 
the key elements of the remuneration package for each director are set out in the table below:
element base salary
purpose and link  
to strategy
provides a base level of remuneration to support recruitment and retention of executive 
directors with the necessary experience and expertise to deliver the group’s strategy.the company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the non-executive directors and 
chairman and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.any use of the above 
discretions would, where relevant, be explained in future 
directors remuneration reports and may, as appropriate, 
be the subject of consultation with the company’s major 
shareholders.in exceptional 
circumstances, the committee may decide that the 
participant’s awards will vest early on the date of cessation 
of employment.the committee may also agree that the company will 
compensate executives, both internal and external, for 
certain relocation expenses as appropriate.total shareholder return is the sum of share price appreciation and dividends paid during the year.in the year to 30 june 2017, the 
increase in the base salary of the chief executive officer was 0.8% and the average annual increase over the last three years 
was 3.6%.these awards are expected to be at 300% and 150% of salary for jolyon 
harrison and stefan allanson respectively.remuneration committee – support and advice
the committee is supported by the human resources director, beth broughton, and the company secretary, stefan allanson.the committee is satisfied that the appointment 
of these advisors is in accordance with the company’s policy on the provision of non-audit services to the group and the 
external advice received is independent.to the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that 
non-audit services prohibited by the frc’s ethical standard 
were not provided to the group or the parent company.as a result, we believe total 
assets is the primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the parent company and is therefore the 
appropriate benchmark to use in setting 
materiality.we have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.our 
review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the uk 
corporate governance code (the “code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and 
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
