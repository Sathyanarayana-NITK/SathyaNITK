top-down robust assessment, as explained in the corporate governance 
framework section of this annual report on page 55. if any of these 
risks occur, stock spirits’ business, financial condition and performance 
might suffer and the trading price and liquidity of the shares may

in october 2017, the group’s german subsidiary, baltic distillery gmbh, received notification from the german tax 
authorities of the commencement of a standard enquiry covering its 2015 corporate income tax return.whilst it is the case that there could be a risk of a material exposure arising from ongoing enquiries in respect of positions 
taken other than those related to transfer pricing discussed above, the group considers this to be unlikely and accordingly 
have made no provision in relation to these risks.the impairment loss was fully allocated to goodwill and included in ‘exceptional expense’ (note 8).the following table shows the distribution of loan principal balances as at 31 december 2017 and 31 december 2016 in euros.foreign currency risk
