in
2003, under hambledon mining’s ownership
(subsequently renamed to altyn plc), further
exploration work was undertaken and gold
production from the mine and processing plant
commenced in 2008.
in 2014, the company released the findings of the
mining consultant, venmyn deloitte’s competent
persons report on the mine, which demonstrated
jorc reserves of 2.26moz, jorc resources of
5.14moz and a development plan to increase annual
gold production to 100,000oz.the geological data that the company acquired
indicates that there are several mineralised zones at
karasuyskoye and this leads the company to
believe that this project has the potential to contain
significant gold resources. refurbishment of the processing plant and the
preparation of the ore bodies together with the
completion of tailings dam 4 in early 2017, now
allows for the rapid increase in production once
the equipment is in situ expected to be in q3
2018. the tailings dam will provide sufficient
storage for at least three years.the current share range has seen a drop from the
prior year and in the region of 1.0-1.3p (2016:
1.5-2.0p).while the required level of funding has not been secured, the
assaubayev family, which owns 69.8% of the altyn shares through its vehicle, african
resources, has invested in and lent to the company in the past and is keen to see the
company succeed.given the higher grades expected to be processed
and the low cash cost of production the company has a significant buffer and will remain
profitable at lower gold prices.encountering technical difficulties in further developing the underground mine at
sekisovskoye would be negative for the future of the company.the company mitigates this risk by
careful operational planning and detailed technical appraisal work, as well as regular
maintenance work
the company’s management has analysed the risks and uncertainties and has in place
control systems that monitor daily the performance of the business via key performance
indicators.the details of the resolutions are given on page 59. the directors consider that all of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the
company and its shareholders as a whole.no interest was paid in relation to this loan in the year and it is expected that the balance of the bond to include
accrued interest will be converted into new ordinary shares in q3 2018.

the policy was approved at the annual general meeting in june 2015, and is subject to approval by shareholders in the annual general meeting to be held in
2018.

report issued by venmyn deloitte and noted that, despite the operational difficulties mentioned above, the assumption
regarding mineable reserves continued to be valid.together with the parent company and its group consolidation, which was also subject to a full
scope audit, these represent the significant components of the group.from the
operating cash flows generated the company paid the balance of the ebrd loan, which with interest amounted to us$3.5m.the company’s revenue is generated entirely from the sale of the gold and silver (“precious metal”) content of gold doré.deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for by using the balance sheet liability method.such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.transaction costs relating to the equity component are recognised directly in equity.the ore fields are located in close proximity to the
current open pit and underground mining operations of sekisovskoye.the effect is to increase the amortisation charge from us$522,000 to
us$1,021,000, there is no effect on the income statement as the amortisation costs are capitalised as part of exploration and evaluation costs.the recovery of the capitalised cost of the company’s property,
plant and equipment is dependent on the development of the underground mine.in january 2018 the bond holders elected to convert
us$9.7m of the bond into ordinary shares of the company at the conversion price of 3p per share , resulting in the issue of 233,333,333 new ordinary shares

without a conversion feature.the sales proceeds
for gold doré is fixed by reference to the gold and silver prices based on average gold and silver price in the month of sale.the bank loan was repaid in october 2017.
