however, in the short-term 
uk livestock and dairy prices have 
responded positively due to a number  
of factors, including the devaluation  
of sterling.part of the board’s 
role is to consider whether the plan 
continues to take appropriate account  
of the changing external environment.share of associates and jvs
the group’s share of the post-tax result 
in its associates and joint ventures was 
£2.8m, compared to £2.1m in 2016.  
the result reflected both an increase in 
its associates’ profitability and an increase 
in joint venture profitability, primarily 
driven by a recovery in the european 
dairy market which assisted feed block 
performance and a better performance 
in the usa aminomax business.members of the executive 
management teams of businesses within 
the group attend from time to time  
and make presentations.the board noted that 
improvements continue to be made  
to the group’s governance framework  
and that matters highlighted in the 2013 
and 2016 reviews had been addressed.the purpose of the 
report is to highlight the areas that the 
committee has reviewed and how  
we have discharged our responsibilities 
effectively during the year.the performance 
of bendalls had been impacted by  
a significant contract delay and losses 
on certain other contracts however,  
in the light of the delayed contract 
coming back on stream, other 
contracts won in the year and 
improvements made to controls in the 
business, the committee determined 
that no impairment was required.the committee also considered and  
was satisfied that all the key events  
and issues which have been reported to 
the board in the ceo’s monthly reports 
during the year, both good and bad, 
have been adequately referenced  
or reflected within the annual report.pwc is also required to tell us about any  
significant facts and matters that may  
reasonably be thought to bear on their 
independence or on the objectivity  
of the lead partner and the audit team.the chairman and the non-executive directors are entitled to 
reimbursement of reasonable expenses.at the end of the financial year,  
the committee noted that significant 
progress had been made against the 
strategic targets.by order of the board

strategic report / corporate governance / financial statements
independent auditors’ report to the members of carr’s group plc 
opinion
in our opinion, carr’s group plc’s  
group financial statements and 
company financial statements  
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state  
of the group’s and of the company’s 
affairs as at 2 september 2017 and  
of the group’s profit and the group’s 
and the company’s cash flows for  
the 52 week period (the “period”)  
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with ifrss as adopted  
by the european union and, as regards 
the company’s financial statements, 
as applied in accordance with  
the provisions of the companies  
act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
companies act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements,  
article 4 of the ias regulation.three of these reporting units were deemed financially significant and the 
other three were selected for particular risk characteristics, which included coverage of the 
risks relating to pension assumptions, fraud in revenue, and of the profit from the associate.in particular,  
we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example  
in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain.we compared current year actual 
results with the fy17 figures included in the prior year 
forecast to assess the accuracy of management’s historic 
forecasts.we challenged 
management’s assumptions within the forecasts for short 
and mid-term growth by comparing to the previous 
performance of the business and understanding and 
validating the measures implemented by management  
to achieve this growth.we performed testing over the operating effectiveness  
of controls with respect to approval of credit limits and 
monthly reviews of the receivables ledger.appointment
following the recommendation  
of the audit committee, we have been 
appointed as auditors since at least  
1909 to audit the financial statements  
for the year ended 31 march 1909 and 
subsequent financial periods.during the year £618,000 (2016: £7,000) was transferred 
from the equity compensation reserve to retained earnings and £201,000 (2016: £321,000) was transferred from the equity compensation reserve  
to investment in subsidiaries in respect of options exercised in the year.the separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of the 
acquired subsidiary undertakings were incorporated into the financial 
statements on the basis of the fair value as at the effective date of the 
group acquiring control.the balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling 
using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income 
statements are translated into sterling using the average exchange  
rate for the year.at each balance sheet date the group revises its estimate of the  
number of options that are expected to vest.progress payments received are deducted from the value of work in 
progress except to the extent that payments on account exceed the 
value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included  
in trade and other payables.the group’s policy is to hedge its international assets and it has 
designated foreign currency loans as a hedge against net investment in 
foreign operations.this requires an estimation of the value in use of 
the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated.this requires 
management to make an assessment of the overall profitability and  
the stage of completion of the entire contract in order to determine  
the level of revenue and profit to recognise.the group does not have the ability to control the financial and operating policies of its associates.interests in the joint ventures listed above are held directly by the holding company with the following exceptions: carrs billington agriculture (sales)
