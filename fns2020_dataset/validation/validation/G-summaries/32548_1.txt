transactions with related parties
the only subsisting material transactions which the company 
has entered into with related parties are:
• relationship agreement: the relationship agreement 
was entered into on 28 february 2014 and regulates the 
relationship between kkr my best friend limited (the 
“principal shareholder”) and the company following listing.it remains the company’s 
policy not to make political donations or to incur political 
expenditure, however the application of the relevant provisions 
of the companies act 2006 is potentially very broad in nature 
and, as last year, the board is seeking shareholder authority 
to ensure that the group does not inadvertently breach these 
provisions as a result of the breadth of its business activities, 
although the board has no intention of using this authority.the sbp process 
produces standard outputs in respect of the key financial 
performance metrics of the group which deliver consolidated 
financial plans at both group level and at a number of levels 
within the group.we will continue to train 
colleagues and suppliers as appropriate.in addition to our regular agenda, this year we have considered 
accounting for business combinations and the segmental 
disclosures made by the group.in their reports 
presented to the committee at both the half year and full 
year, the auditors considered these risks to be appropriately 
addressed and raised no significant areas of concern in these 
or any other areas of their review.risk management and internal controls
risk management and the system of internal control are the 
responsibility of the board.reviewed the independence of the 
non-executive directors.succession planning 
a principal risk to the business is the inability to attract, retain 
and incentivise talented individuals to deliver our strategy.proposed changes
the committee considered a range of approaches for the 
group’s ltips and sought an early view from investors for a 
significant simplification of our share plans.•  awards under the rsp will vest in full subject to absolute tsr 
being positive over the first three years of the vesting period; 
•  if absolute tsr performance is negative at the end of the three 
year period the awards will lapse in full; and
• for awards made in 2017 absolute tsr performance will be 
calculated by taking the average absolute tsr for the final 
three or six month period of the plan ending on 26 march 2020 
and comparing it with the average absolute tsr for the three or 
six month period ending on 30 march 2017. this ensures that 
the starting point for the underpin calculation occurs prior to 
the recent reduction in share price.annual bonus
the committee reviewed the performance of both the business 
and each executive director against targets set at the beginning 
of the year for the annual bonus scheme.maximum opportunity
• whilst there is no maximum salary level, 
any increases will normally be broadly in line 
with the wider colleague population.• the committee ensures that targets 
are appropriately stretching in the 
context of the business plan and 
that there is an appropriate balance 
between incentivising executive 
directors to meet financial targets 
for the year and to deliver specific 
non-financial goals.• alternatively, the committee may, at its discretion, allow 
unvested awards to vest at an earlier date, having regard to  
the achievement of performance conditions/financial underpin 
to that date and the period of time that has passed since the 
date of grant.annual bonus – corresponds to the amount earned in respect of the relevant financial year.our procedures included: 
•  control design: evaluating the group’s budgeting procedures 
and methodology upon which the forecasts are based;
•  our sector experience: using our own valuation specialist to 
assist us in evaluating the discount rate used by the group;
•  benchmarking assumptions: comparing assumptions and 
methodologies used by the group to externally derived data as 
well as our own assessment, using knowledge of the company 
and sector, of key inputs such as projected economic growth, 
cost inflation and discount rates; 
•  sensitivity analysis: performing break-even analysis to 
understand the sensitivity of the conclusions reached to 
changes in assumptions;
•  comparing valuations: comparing the sum of projected cash 
flows and book value to the group’s market capitalisation 
to assess the reasonableness of those cash flows; and
•  assessing transparency: evaluating the adequacy of the 
group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of 
the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions.the investments have been equity accounted for in the group’s financial statements in accordance with ias 28.10. as the group’s shares are 
non-participatory, and therefore the group does not share in any profits, losses or other distribution of value from the joint venture company, 
the fair value of the investment on initial recognition does not change, subject to impairment.pets at home group plc

notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued contingent consideration
contingent consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary is valued at fair value at the time of acquisition.the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated.cash flow hedging reserve
the hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.participation may also be offered, at the discretion of the board (taking account of the recommendations of the remuneration committee), to other 
directors or employees who otherwise do not satisfy all of the above criteria, although non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the 
saye.
