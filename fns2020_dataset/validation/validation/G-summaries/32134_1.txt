dear shareholder,
we believe that good corporate 
governance is essential for building a 
successful and sustainable business in 
the long-term interests of shareholders.the composition of the non-
executive directors was considered satisfactory with 
a reasonable balance of skills and diversity.external audit effectiveness
given that kpmg were newly appointed during 
the period ended 2 april 2016, it was deemed 
appropriate to defer the review of their effectiveness 
until the completion of the 2015/16 audit cycle.the committee 
confirms that it has not been advised of any failings 
or breaches which it considers to be significant 
during the financial period and found the internal 
controls to be effective.the directors do not recommend the payment of a 
dividend for the period ended 1 april 2017 (2015/16: 
£nil).to simplify the bonus structure, it is proposed that 
the annual bonus and dsbp are consolidated with 
no change in quantum so that the annual bonus 
opportunity is 150% of salary for the ceo and 105% 
for the cfo.strategic report introduction governance financial statements 37 governance

directors’ remuneration report continued
premier foods plc annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 april 2017 42 base salary and fees (executive directors) (audited)
the committee sets base salary by reference to the size and complexity of the business based on factors such as revenue, market share, and total enterprise value 
rather than just market capitalisation, which can be volatile as a result of the group’s capital structure.as discussed in the chairman's statement on page 03 the company results for the period were below expectation due largely to a change in retailer promotional 
strategy which reduced category volumes, and significant input cost inflation.the committee agreed that whilst 
significant progress had been made in the period in respect of strategic measures the financial underpin had not been achieved and therefore no bonus was payable.further details of all 
outstanding ltip awards are provided in the table on page 49. anticipated vesting of 2014 ltip award
the performance conditions for the 2014 ltip award were based on a relative 
tsr condition (comprising 2/3rds of the award) and an adjusted eps condition 
(comprising 1/3rd of the award).our procedures included: 
• assessing cash generating units: assessing the appropriateness of the 
cash generating units identified;
• assessing principles: assessing the principles of the cash flow models for 
the grocery cash generating unit and mr kipling brand; 
• benchmarking assumptions: evaluating assumptions used, in particular 
those relating to: i) the short and long-term revenue growth rates; ii) future 
changes in profitability; iii) the discount rates used; and iv) the royalty rate used 
in the mr kipling brand assessment, comparing these with externally derived 
data and using our own valuation specialists where applicable; 
• sensitivity analysis: performing sensitivity analysis of key assumptions 
including discount rates, short and long-term revenue growth rates, 
profitability and royalty rate; and
• assessing disclosures: assessing whether the group’s disclosures relating to 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessments to changes in key 
assumptions reflect the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and brands.our procedures included: 
• assessing recognition: reviewing historical taxable profits and considering 
if there is convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable profits will be 
available;
• evaluating assumptions: evaluating assumptions used, in particular those 
relating to: i) the short and long-term revenue growth rates; ii) future changes in 
profitability; and iii) adjustments to profit before tax to determine taxable profits, 
using our own tax specialists where applicable; and
• assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the group’s disclosures 
relating to the sensitivity of the recognition of deferred tax assets to changes in 
key assumptions reflected in the inherent risk.2.3 revenue
revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, 
discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable to revenue 
and after eliminating sales within the group.2.16 provisions
provisions (for example restructuring or property exit costs) are recognised when 
the group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations 
and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.5.2 auditor remuneration

the discount rate applied to the cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital ('wacc') which would be anticipated 
for a market participant investing in the group.the management of these risks, 
along with the day-to-day management of treasury activities is performed by 
the group finance function.the transactional 
amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in 
these currencies against sterling.the target of fixed/capped debt is defined in the 
group treasury policy and procedures, however, the amount hedged can be 
amended subject to agreement by the board.it also supports three defined benefit pension schemes in the uk; two of the three schemes have significant technical funding deficits which could have an adverse 
impact on the financial condition of the group.deficit recovery plans have been agreed with 
the trustees of each of the pfps and pgpps.profit and loss reserve
