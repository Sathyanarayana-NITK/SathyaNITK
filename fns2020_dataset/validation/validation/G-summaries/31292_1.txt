aggregation risk.we tailored the extent of the work to be performed on each

on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at each 
component.the other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the

net gaming revenue derives from online gambling operations and is defined as the difference between the amounts of bets placed by the 
players less amounts won by players.goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired.where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (ie the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), 
the asset is written down accordingly.impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty 
or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the 
amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash 
flows associated with the impaired receivable.the group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of 
financial position.exchange differences on investments 
denominated in a foreign currency and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method are recognised in profit and loss.the fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting conditions is measured by the application of the black-scholes option 
pricing model by reference to the grant date of the options.internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:
 » it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold;
 » adequate resources are available to complete the development;
 » there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
 » the group is able to sell the product;
 » sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and
 » expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the group expects to benefit from selling the products developed.estimates
(a) impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and their values are written-down on the basis of the group’s expectations 
of future economic benefits expected to be received.see note 13.
