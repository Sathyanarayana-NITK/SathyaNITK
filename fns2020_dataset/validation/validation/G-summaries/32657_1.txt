inventory is a significant balance and the group’s main raw 
materials are commodities which are subject to price volatility.the consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the 
equity interests issued by the group (and for acquisitions prior to 1 july 2009 costs directly attributable to the acquisition).the allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.the closing balance in the current year represents the carrying value of the customer relationships acquired during the 
acquisitions of groupe rubicon limited and funkin limited.the interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement 
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period.the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.annual report and accounts 2017

key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date and the amounts reported for revenues 
and expenses during the year.offsetting the curtailment gain is a further £1.5m of costs incurred in relation to the closure of the defined benefit pension 
scheme.they have been calculated consistently with last period’s disclosures, however these change over time with financial 
conditions and assumptions.under the terms of the aesop rules, any award of free shares to employees is made by the trustee of the aesop subject to the 
company’s consent.details of transactions between the company and related parties are as follows:
