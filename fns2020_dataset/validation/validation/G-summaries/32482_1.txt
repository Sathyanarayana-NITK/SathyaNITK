in percentage terms the profit before tax margin was 16% (2016: 17%).the performance of the group could be adversely affected if the required 
staffing levels are not maintained.role of the chairman and chief executive officer
the code requires that there should be a clear division of responsibilities between the running of the board and the executive 
responsible for the company’s business, so as to ensure that no one person has unrestricted powers of decision.the audit committee, chaired by ian steele, who has recent and relevant experience, is authorised by the board to conduct 
any activity within its terms of reference and to seek any information it requires from any employee.executive directors and senior 
management meet to review both the risks facing the business and the controls established to minimise those risks and their 
effectiveness in operation on an on-going basis.for this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.customers
the group treats all of its customers with the utmost respect and seeks to be honest and fair in all relationships with them.under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company and group for that period.this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006. 
our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.year ended 31march 2017

the following notes form part of the financial statements.new standards and interpretations of existing standards 
that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early 
by the group
ifrs 15, revenue from contracts with customers, becomes 
effective for the group on 1 april 2018. the guidance permits 
two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior 
reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or 
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying 
the guidance recognised at the date of initial application (the 
cumulative catch-up transition method).under ifrs 15 this revenue will require to be split 
between the registration of the domain and the

2. accounting policies (continued)
acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition 
method.consequently, these acquisition costs are included 
as administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.in respect of property leases 
which contain such a reinstatement provision the estimated 
cost of the reinstatement is provided in the financial statements.a matching provision is recognised at the 
same time which is increased over the period of the lease by 
way of an interest charge such that the estimated cost of the 
reinstatement has been fully provided at the end of the lease 
period.the increase in 
the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest 
expense.financial liabilities
financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial 
assets and are recognised when the group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.the value in use calculation requires the 
entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from 
the cash-generating unit and to select a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value.during the year
