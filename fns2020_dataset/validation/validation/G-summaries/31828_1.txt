overview of our audit approach
risks of material 
misstatement
• inappropriate revenue recognition: misstatement of revenue recognised at or near year end
• rebates: misstatement of rebate income
audit scope • the company performs all transaction processing and financial statement preparation centrally in the 
uk and operates under one legal entity.these matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.• to gain assurance that the requirements for 
revenue recognition have been met during the 
period, we tested the two-way correlation between 
revenue and trade receivables and three-way 
correlation between revenue, trade receivables and 
cash for the year.our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.matters on which we are required to report by exception
in light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.this change is driven by the application 
of the control principle, where the business would need to establish ‘control’ of goods, whether hardware, software or services, 
prior to delivery to the customer.financial statements
