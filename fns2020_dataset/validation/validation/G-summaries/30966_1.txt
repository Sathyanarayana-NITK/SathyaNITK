executive committees
the board has established the strategy group, consisting of the chairman and the executive directors of
the board, and two executive committees.the committee is satisﬁed that the provisions
represent best estimates of the likely liabilities.in preparing these ﬁnancial statements, international accounting standard 1 requires that
directors:
■ properly select and apply accounting policies.remuneration committee
details of the remuneration committee (“the committee”) are set out on page 32.
policy on directors’ remuneration
the policy agreed by the committee is as follows:-
■ to seek to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate the right people for
the roles.■ to reﬂect the overriding remuneration philosophy and the principles of the wider group.these overdrafts are excluded from the deﬁnition of cash and cash equivalents
disclosed on the balance sheet.the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised
amounts of acquiree’s identiﬁable net assets.where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.biological assets: current
produce is valued on the basis of net present values of expected future cash ﬂows and include certain
assumptions about yields, selling prices, costs and discount rates.non-current assets classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell.■ where the tax law restricts the source of taxable proﬁts against which particular types of deferred tax
assets can be recovered, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets can only be assessed in
combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type.the group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of
adopting ifrs 9 based on the ﬁnancial instruments as at the date of initial application of ifrs 9. based on
the group’s preliminary assessment, the adoption of ifrs 9 will not have a material impact on the
ﬁnancial statements.the income statement will also be aﬀected because the total expense is typically higher in the earlier
years of a lease and lower in later years.further details of directors’ emoluments are set out on pages 34 to 35.249229 camellia r&a pp54-pp69  18/04/2018  18:15  page 65 camellia plc

included in revenue is £0.6 million (2016: £0.4 million) of rental income generated from investment
properties.direct operating expenses arising on the investment property, the majority of which
generated rental income in the period, amounted to £0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million).in particular we assessed the reasonableness of
management’s assumption that the intangible assets sold can be treated
under the capital gains regime and the resultant conclusion that there is
no de-grouping charge or required additional disclosure.a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located on the
