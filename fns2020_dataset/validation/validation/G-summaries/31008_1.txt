the companies in which we inve st on behalf of our clients 
— developing our employees 
— motivating and rewarding our employees appropriately, 
encouraging their development 
— working with communities 
— engaging in the communit ies in which we operate 
— being aware of our environment

responsible investment 
rathbones specialises in discretionary private client investment 
management.by promoting the succes s of 
those around us, we can help to generate the co nditions for sustainable growth in our business.following a skills audit, which was initiated 
by the nomination committee and presented to the board, 
consideration is being given to recruiting an additional non-
executive director with the aim of bringing new skills to the board, 
taking account of the existing ba lance of knowledge, experience 
and diversity.in addition, the board has discussed and approved the 
recommendations from the nomination committee to strengthen 
and formalise executive succession planning and talent 
management processes throughout the firm.business review

board development 
the firm is committed to the training and development of all staff 
to ensure professional standards are maintained and enhanced.it ensures there is 
the correct balance of skills, ex perience and expertise amongst 
non-executive directors to lead decision-making and assess the 
performance and strategy of the company.this is an area where relatively minor changes 
could deliver significant improvement 
— succession planning: the board should have clearer timelines 
generally and greater visibility of the executive succession 
planning process, including increasing the non-executive 
exposure to senior management below executive  
committee level 
— board diversity: a need to revi ew the composition of the board 
to ensure that diversity in its br oadest sense (age, outlook, skills 
and ethnicity) is considered 
overall, the conclusion from th e board evaluation and appraisal 
process was positive, with all directors contributing actively to the 
effective performance of the board and the board committees of 
which he or she is a member.to do this we: 
— review reports from the risk team on risk appetite  
issues including any early wa rning signals and advise  
the board accordingly 
— discuss any loss events and near misses, the lessons  
learned and management action taken 
— review end-to-end process ri sk assessments undertaken  
and any resulting internal control enhancements 
— advise the board on the risk aspects of proposed major  
strategic change 
— review risk weightings on performance objectives for 
executive remuneration 
— review (prior to board ap proval) key regulatory  
submissions including the group internal capital  
adequacy assessment process (icaap) document 
full terms of reference for the committee are reviewed  
annually and are available on the company’s website.the committee has considered a wide range of topics 
with a focus on the following areas: 
— analysis of the firm’s financial reporting with particular 
consideration of accounting judgments taken during the 
preparation of the financial statements 
— review of the firm’s client assets sourcebook (cass) audit and 
submissions  
— impact of the reporting standards relating to ifrs 9 ‘financial 
instruments’, ifrs 15 ‘revenue from contracts with 
customers’ and ifrs 16 ‘leases’.as a result of the eu audit directive 
and audit regulations, the non-audit services policy was updated 
and approved.these formal meetings are 
minuted and copies of the mi nutes are sent to committee 
members and to the board.philip howell

roles and responsibilities  
the committee’s responsibilities are 
— determine and set the firm’s remuneration philosophy, 
ensuring that it is aligned wi th the business plan and risk 
appetite  
— approve the remuneration poli cy for executive directors 
for final approval by shareholders and make 
remuneration decisions within the policy 
— approve total annual remuneration for executive 
directors based on achievements against objectives set 
by the committee 
— review total annual remuneration for executive 
committee members and material risk takers  
full terms of reference for the committee are reviewed 
annually and are available on the company’s website.in 
addition to the committee’s usual activities, we have undertaken 
an extensive review of the remune ration policy, which applies to 
executive directors in order to ensure that it remains fit for 
purpose, aligned to our business strategy and supportive of the 
interests of shareholders and clients.in 
setting the quantum of the award, the committee observed 
that the proposed package for the executive directors was 
consistent with the lower quartile of our competitive market.this is wider than the 
power given under the rules 
so it would be necessary to 
change the rules to ensure 
that the policy could be 
complied with.executive directors are permitted to hold external 
appointments and to receive payments, provided such 
appointments are agreed by the board in advance, there no 
conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to 
deterioration in the executive’s performance.save as you earn (saye) 
this benefit is the value of the discount on saye options granted 
during the year.when establishing 
performance ranges for these ta rgets, the committee has been 
particularly mindful of the historic performance of the business in 
different market conditions, the continuing need for investment in 
the business and the increase in regulatory capital buffers in 2018 
and 2019 required by capital requ irements regulations (see pages 
38 to 41).clear disclosure will be provided in 
this instance regarding the nature and materiality of any change in 
the directors’ remuneration report for the relevant financial year.for newly 
recruited managers, the group capitalises payments that are 
deemed to represent the transfer of existing client relationships 
already held by the investme nt manager.5 we have nothing to report on the 
other information in the annual 
report and accounts  
the directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the annual report together with the financial statements.contingent liabilities are possible obligations that depend on the 
outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations 
where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be 
measured reliably.during the year the group capitalised £2,743,000 of payments 
made to investment managers and expensed £5,094,000  
(2016: £7,926,000 capitalised and £4,005,000 expensed).the allocati on of these costs is shown in a separate column in the tabl e 
below, alongside the information presented for internal reporting to the group executive committee, which is the group’s chief operating 
decision maker.no further impairment was recognised at 
31 december 2017. 
based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax cgu at 31 december 2017 was 
£1,181,000; this was higher than its carrying value of £864,000.the group regularly reviews its financia l risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the 
business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.at 31 december 2017

treasury policy, rathbone investment management ('the bank') pe rforms an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with 
the regulatory requirements of the prudential regulation authority (pra) (our individual liquidity adequacy assessment).the company’s financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the company face s, to set 
appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliabl e and up-to-
date information systems.details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how 
reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
