executive committee
the day to day running of the business rests with the group chief executive, richard harpin.directors’ indemnities and insurance
the company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the beneﬁt of its 
directors which were in place during the year and remain in force at the date of this report.the system of internal control is designed to 
manage and mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.individual pay is determined by the committee 
taking into account the role, responsibilities, 
performance and experience of the individual and 
market data on comparable roles.under the rules of the plan, the committee has the discretion to adjust the targets applying to 
existing awards in exceptional circumstances providing the new targets are no less challenging 
than originally envisaged.the committee also has the power to adjust the number of shares 
subject to an award in the event of a variation in the capital of the company.in the case of cessation due to death, the committee 
can determine that the awards vest early.governance

in determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver and the extent to 
which their award may vest, the committee will take into account the circumstances of an 
individual’s departure.the remuneration committee 
is comfortable that this does not present a conﬂict of interest as aon uk and nbs operate 
entirely independently of one another.the committee has also received assistance from richard harpin, group chief executive, emma 
thomas, group legal and hr director and anna maughan, company secretary, all of whom 
attended meetings of the committee as required.the salaries for the executive directors e’ective from 1 july 2017 will therefore be as follows:
name of director

1 july 2016

fees for the chairman and non-executive directors
as detailed in the remuneration policy, the company aims to set remuneration for non-
executive directors at a level which is su‡cient to attract and retain non-executive directors 
of the right calibre.in line with the policy, the fy18 performance share award for executive directors will be at 
150% of salary.the shares required for share options and awards under any of the long-term incentive 
schemes described above may be fulﬁlled by the purchase of shares in the market by the 
company’s employee beneﬁt trust (ebt).information about the use of ﬁnancial instruments by the group is given in note 42 
to the ﬁnancial statements.none of these are considered 
to be signiﬁcant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the group as a whole.under company law, the 
directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of a’airs of the company and of the proﬁt or loss of the company for 
that period.further detail on the key judgements involved is set out within the audit and risk committee 
report on page 77, signiﬁcant accounting policies in note 2 and the associated key 
judgements involved are set out in the critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements.the key assumptions used within the carrying value of goodwill assessment were consistent 
with the group’s longer term-viability and going concern assessment.in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identiﬁed any material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report.the 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation.such cumulative exchange 
movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.if any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any.financial instruments
financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the group’s balance sheet when the group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets
the annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates 
of the value in use (or fair value less costs to sell) of cash-generating units to which goodwill and 
acquisition intangibles have been allocated.the results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 march 2014 were updated to the accounting date by a 
qualiﬁed independent actuary in accordance with ias19.financial statements
