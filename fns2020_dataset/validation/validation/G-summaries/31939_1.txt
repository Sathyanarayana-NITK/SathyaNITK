during the year the group extended its 
currently unutilised three year revolving 
loan facility with barclays bank plc to 
£3.0m (2016: £1.5m) which together 
with the funds raised in the placing 
strengthens the group’s balance sheet.the increase in net assets 
reflects the proceeds of the placing 
offset by the loss made in the year.financial review
redemption volumes, a key measure of usage of the 
air platform, grew by 58% year-on-year to 60.4m for 
the year (2016: 38.4m).redemption volumes, a key measure 
of usage of the air platform, grew 
by 58% year-on-year to 60.4m for 
the year (2016: 38.4m) driven by the 
full year impact of our solution for 
asda’s coupon counting going fully 
live in the prior year, initial sainsbury’s 
transactions and increased volumes 
from existing f&b and other retail 
clients.the group 
may not be able to meet these levels 
of service due to a variety of factors, 
both inside and outside the group’s 
control.financial review continued
principal risks and uncertainties
evolution of the market
the group operates in an evolving 
market and there is a possibility that the 
rate of growth in mobile commerce will 
not match independent predictions or 
that users of mobile devices will change 
their behaviour with respect to mobile 
commerce.there 
is a significant delay between the time of 
filing of a patent application and the time 
its contents are made public, and others 
may have filed patent applications for 
subject matter covered by the group’s 
pending patent applications without the 
group being aware of those applications.strategic report

employee involvement
the group recognises and seeks 
to encourage the involvement of its 
employees, with the aim being the 
recruitment, motivation and retention of 
quality employees throughout the group.although it is not 
possible at this point in time to predict 
fully the effects of an exit of the uk from 
the european union, it could have a 
material effect on the group’s business, 
financial condition and results of 
operations.statement as to disclosure of information to the auditor
the directors who were in office on the date of approval of 
these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they 
are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
auditor is unaware.board structure
the board is responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the group.conclusions relating to going concern
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the isas (uk) require us to report to you 
where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements 
any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the 
greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.in preparing each of the group and company financial statements, the directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with ifrs adopted by the eu and for 
the company financial statements state whether applicable uk accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the company financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
company will continue in business.our response 
as part of our procedures we challenged the director’s 
rationale for changing the basis for identification of cgu’s 
compared to those identified in the previous period.in addition, we have further challenged the assertions made 
in the model in respect of employee service and performance 
vesting conditions and sensitised a range of alternative 
scenarios for these along with other assumptions used in 
the model.our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the 
companies act 2006. our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose.the areas involving a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
financial information, are disclosed in note 2.
the presentational and functional currency of the group is sterling.1 january 2018
ifrs 15, revenue from 
contracts with customers 
the standard specifies how and when a company will recognise revenue as 
well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with 
more informative, relevant disclosures.1 january 2018
ifrs 16, leases the standard requires lessees to account for leases under a single on-
balance sheet model in a similar way to finance leases under ias 17. at the 
commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make 
lease payments and an asset representing the right to use the underlying 
asset during the lease term.as the group has not been involved in any 
transactions including advance consideration in foreign currencies, the 
directors do not expect adoption of this interpretation to have an impact on 
the group.the directors have prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows looking beyond 12 months from the date of approval of 
these consolidated financial statements.basis of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 june 
each year.the key 
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of assets 
or liabilities within the next accounting period are outlined below:
impairment of internally-generated intangible assets
an impairment review of the group’s development costs is undertaken at least annually.revenue recognition
where the group is providing material development services, development fees are recognised in line with percentage completion 
of work performed towards milestones.in the year to 30 june 2016, revenue from two 
of the group’s customers represented more than 10% of the group’s revenue.the maximum exposure to credit risk for 
trade and other receivables at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable disclosed above.notes to the consolidated financial statements continued financial statements
