is to assist the board in discharging 
its responsibilities in relation to 
internal and external audits and 
controls, including reviewing the 
group’s annual financial statements, 
considering the scope of the annual 
audit and the extent of the non audit 
work undertaken by external auditors, 
advising on the appointment of 
external auditors and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
systems in place within the group.the audit and risk committee will 
give due consideration to laws and 
regulations, the provisions of the uk 
corporate governance code and the 
requirements of the listing rules.the audit and risk committee is also 
responsible for advising the board 
on the company’s risk strategy, risk 
policies and current risk exposures, 
overseeing the implementation and 
maintenance of the overall risk 
management framework and systems, 
and reviewing the company’s risk 
assessment processes and capability 
to identify and manage new risks.the audit and risk committee’s duties 
and responsibilities are set out in its 
terms of reference which are available 
on the company’s website.the audit and risk 
committee as a whole has competence 
relevant to the sector in which the 
company operates.the audit and risk committee, on 
behalf of the board, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
systems and risk management 
processes in place, taking account of 
any material developments since the 
year end.the policy has also been developed 
taking into account the expectations of 
uk institutional shareholders, and 
includes several best practice features 
that ensure strong long-term alignment 
with shareholders.key considerations when setting 
the remuneration policy
when setting the directors’ remuneration 
policy, the committee took into account 
the overall business strategy and 
long-term interests of the company, 
with a view to attracting, retaining and 
motivating high quality individuals and 
delivering rewards to shareholders.consistent with these principles, 
the committee has designed a 
remuneration policy which will:
 ― attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executives in order to deliver 
the company’s strategic goals and 
business objectives
 ― align the interests of executives with 
those of shareholders and other 
external stakeholders
 ― be simple and understandable, 
both internally and externally
 ― have a significant proportion tied 
to the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions to ensure 
individuals are rewarded fairly for 
success, while ensuring prevention 
of rewards for failure
 ― provide an appropriate balance 
between short- and long-term 
performance targets linked to the 
delivery of the company’s strategic 
plan and aligned with the company’s 
risk appetite
 ― take account of good governance 
and promote the long-term success 
of the group
 ― consider the wider pay environment, 
both internally and externally
in seeking to achieve the above 
objectives, the committee is mindful 
of the views of a broad range of 
stakeholders and accordingly takes 
account of a number of factors when 
setting remuneration, including market 
conditions, pay and employment 
conditions across the group, the 
expectations of institutional 
shareholders and feedback from 
shareholders and other stakeholders.executive directors are eligible 
for other benefits which are 
introduced for the wider workforce 
on broadly similar terms.the circumstances in which the company may apply the provisions 
include a material misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing the performance condition, serious misconduct on the 
part of a participant, or any other exceptional circumstances which the committee considers justify the operation of the 
recovery and withholding provisions.however, if a participant is deemed to be a “good leaver” in certain prescribed circumstances such as 
injury, disability, retirement, their employing company or the business for which they work being sold 
out of the group or other circumstances at the committee’s discretion, their awards will ordinarily vest 
on the original vesting date to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied, and will 
normally be subject to time pro-rating for the proportion of the vesting period served.unlike executive directors, senior managers may 
receive awards of restricted shares without performance conditions.in preparing 
the financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
 ― select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
 ― state whether applicable ifrss as 
adopted by the european union 
have been followed for the group 
financial statements and united 
kingdom accounting standards, 
comprising frs 102, have been 
followed for the company financial 
statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements
 ― make judgments and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
 ― prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
group and parent company will 
continue in business
the directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the group and parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the group and 
parent company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements 
and the directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the companies act 
2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, article 4 of the 
ias regulation.accounting for acquisitions and/or the renegotiation of ppas 
is complex with a number of judgments required to assess the 
accounting standards applicable to each agreement.accounting for business combinations – valuation of assets 
acquired/liabilities assumed (notes 2.3, 2.4, 4.5, 4.10, 4.11, 4.25)
as discussed above, the group acquired new power plant 
portfolios in brazil and italy during the year.in addition to reading the ppas, we read the sale and purchase 
agreements (“spas”) associated with the acquisitions in brazil and 
italy, and performed audit procedures over both the identification 
of assets acquired (including any potential intangible assets) and 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.management use this measure as it allows the underlying profitability of the group’s 
core business activities to be assessed year on year as it eliminates balances related to the initial 
acquisition of assets (which are not directly related to ongoing performance of the assets) and 
certain other items which give rise to fluctuations in results which are not directly linked to the 
performance of the asset (for example ipo costs)
for each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.we are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to going concern in accordance with 
listing rule 9.8.6r(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.we examined the appropriateness of the group’s accounting 
policies surrounding revenue recognition and we assessed the 
consistency of the application of the revenue recognition policy 
across all operating locations in scope for the group audit.strategic report and directors’ report
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the strategic report and 
directors’ report for the year ended 31st december 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.the financial information is prepared in accordance with ifrs 
under the historical cost convention, as modified for the 
revaluation of certain financial instruments.ifric 22

the directors’ assessment of the prospects of the parent company and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the parent company
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 ― the directors’ confirmation on page 47 of the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the parent company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity
 ― the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated
 ― the directors’ explanation on page 47 of the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the parent company, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the parent company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions
we have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the parent company and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the parent company.
