a global economic downturn could affect the group’s ability 
to deliver growth in the near term but could also present  
an opportunity to acquire businesses at more competitive 
rates and lay the foundation for long-term growth.training on this code was delivered to a number  
of exhibition partners in the middle east in 2017,  
with further proactive engagement with partners 
planned for 2018. to support implementation,  
clauses are coming into effect in new contracts,  
requests for proposals and framework agreements  
to enable the group to better act on any partner 
breaches.the training 
available to colleagues in core functions like sales, event 
production and marketing will continue, ensuring the skills  
and talent needed for long-term performance and success.during 2017 , the integration of penton information services 
involved many group teams, with business planning and  
change management overseeing the progress and success

group finance director
according to the requirements of the companies act 2006, i can confirm that the strategic report, which makes up pages 1 to 71  
of the group’s annual report, has been reviewed and approved by the board of directors.the audit committee has been provided with suitable 
supporting material to review the annual report and  
financial statements and, in accordance with the code,  
has provided assurances for the board to confirm that  
the annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.these methodologies include 
the use of discounted cash flows, revenue forecasts and the 
estimates for the useful economic lives of intangible assets.the policy is designed to ensure that as a public interest entity 
(“pie”), the group complies with both the financial reporting 
council ethical standard for auditors and other eu audit 
regulations, which require that:
•  from 2020 the group will comply with a 70% cap on non-audit 
fees for services provided by the external auditor to european 
economic area (“eea”) pies and their eea subsidiaries.none of the members who served on the 
committee during the year had any personal financial interest, 
other than as a shareholder of the group, or conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
running the business.furthermore, should the recommended offer for ubm plc be 
successful, the committee believes that in order to closely align 
with shareholder interests, the success of that acquisition and  
the returns it generates through the accelerated integration plan 
should be another key component of management incentives 
over the next few years.the committee retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the remuneration policy without reverting  
to shareholders.•  subject to the bullet point below, the aggregate incentive awards that can be received in one year will not exceed the maxima  
in the policy table.in the year of appointment, an off-cycle award under the ltip may be made by the committee to ensure an 
immediate alignment of interests.the committee has not sought the views of colleagues in formulating the remuneration policy because of the operational challenges 
and cost associated with undertaking such an exercise, and no comparison metrics are used.this requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses set out in the international accounting standards 
board’s “framework for the preparation and presentation of 
financial statements”.the increase in materiality over the prior year materiality figure 
(£16.5 million) reflects the inclusion of a full year’s results of 
penton, acquired on 2 november 2016.

revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, vat and other sales-related taxes, and provisions for returns  
and cancellations.lease incentives where these are received from the lessor, such as rent-free periods and contributions to leasehold 
improvements, are treated as a reduction in lease rental expense and spread over the term of the lease.the directors are satisfied that the majority of the group’s cgus  
have a value in excess of their balance sheet carrying value.these results are used for performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees.for the purpose of monitoring segment performance and allocating resources between segments, the group monitors the  
tangible, intangible and financial assets attributable to each segment.the table below has been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned  
on those assets except where the group anticipates that the cash flow will occur in a different period.2016 restated for finalisation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for certain acquisitions completed in 2016 (see note 4).the last actuarial full valuation of the informa final salary scheme was performed by the scheme actuary for the trustees as at
