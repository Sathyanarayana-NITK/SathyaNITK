 receiving updates on and considering senior succession planning and people activities 
with presentation from the group hr director; and

a briefing and update on the group’s

and procedures.information flow 
the company secretary manages the 
provision of information to the board at 
appropriate times in consultation with the 
chairman and chief executive.the code requires the directors to 
assess and report on the prospects  
of the group over a longer period.tax provisions 
the level of current and deferred tax 
recognised in the financial statements is 
dependent on judgements as to the 
outcome of decisions by tax authorities in 
various jurisdictions around the world and 
the ability of the group to use tax losses 
within the time limits imposed by the various 
tax authorities.recognising that investors are keen  
to understand the degree of stretch  
in our incentive performance ranges, 
but mindful of the competitive 
sensitivity of such disclosure, we 
decided in 2016 to disclose the 
performance ranges that applied  
to our stip on a retrospective basis.the financial element of the  
stip paid out at 38% of maximum and  
the individual performance element  
was just ahead of ‘on target’ for  
both the chief executive and the 
finance director.3

annual allocations of conditional shares vest based on performance  
in year one and a further service period of two years.as a result, it is difficult to make 
sensible comparisons with all employees across the group and the salaries of executive directors are therefore reviewed in line 
with the group’s uk employees.in december 2016, when the on-target salary increase for employees in the uk was between 
1.25% and 3%, the chief executive received a salary increase of 2%.departure not in the case of resignation
service contracts allow for the company to terminate employment by paying the director in lieu of some or all of 
their notice period.for the purpose of calculating the value of the remuneration of the chief executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent 
with the ‘single figure’ methodology as defined in the applicable uk directors’ reporting regulations.it is, however, acknowledged 
that these may change over time due 
to the constantly evolving nature of the 
businesses and environments in which 
they operate.at the group 
corporate centre during the year, a series 
of focus groups, confidential interviews 
and telephone discussions were held to 
explore ways to maximise the benefits

overview of our audit approach 
key audit matters audit scope materiality 
 assessment of the carrying value of 
goodwill, other intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment 
 tax provisions 
 revenue recognition, including the risk  
of management override  
 changes in finance systems and processes, 
including the capitalisation of system 
implementation costs (new in 2017) 
 we performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of 126 components 
and audit procedures on specific balances 
for a further 58 components.these matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation  
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.the key audit matters as set out in the table above are consistent with those reported in 2016, with the exception of the inclusion 
of ‘changes in finance systems and processes, including the capitalisation of system implementation costs’ to reflect the primark 
finance system implementation in the year.we believe that normalised profit before 
taxation provides us with the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the group, as the profits less losses on 
sale and closure of businesses are non-recurring and not related to the ongoing trading of the group.during the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and the actual normalised profit before taxation was 6% higher 
than the group’s initial estimates.amortisation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets from the date they are available 
for use.in assessing 
value in use, estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to present value using a  
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the 
asset.post-retirement benefits 
the group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes and similar arrangements are 
assessed annually in accordance with  
ias 19. the accounting valuation, which 
has been assessed using assumptions 
determined with independent actuarial 
advice, resulted in a net asset of £126m 
being recognised as at 16 september 
2017. the size of this net asset is 
sensitive to the market value of the 
assets held by the schemes, to the 
discount rate used in assessing liabilities, 
to the actuarial assumptions (which 
include price inflation, rates of pension 
and salary increases, mortality and other 
demographic assumptions) and to the 
level of contributions.detailed forecasts for a period of ten years to reflect the time required for completion of the business plan were prepared and 
management concluded that the assets were not impaired.other reserves 
£173m of other reserves arose from the cancellation of share premium account by the company in 1993. the remaining £2m 
arose in 2010 as a transfer to capital redemption reserve following redemption of two million £1 deferred shares at par.
