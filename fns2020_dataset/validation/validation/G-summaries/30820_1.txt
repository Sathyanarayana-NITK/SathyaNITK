sufficient time to the company in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively, including not only attendance at board and applicable committee

the annual board away day / visit) and other additional requirements that may 
be required from time to time.disputes that may give rise to significant litigation or 
contractual claims are monitored at each board meeting, with specific 
updates on any material developments or new matters presented by 
the secretary.as part of the board evaluation, the time 
commitments of all directors in line with the 
requirements of the code were reviewed in 
detail.– received the group legislative and regulatory risk assessment 
and ensured that appropriate measures and controls are in place 
and are robust.– reviewed the draft viability statement 
to appear in the 2017 annual report 
and accounts.– reviewed the committee’s 
performance against its agreed 
objectives for 2017 and agreed its key 
objectives and priorities for 2018. the committee also meets privately with representatives from

reviewed the directors’ expectations; the criteria upon which they were based; 
and the sensitivities applied; and agreed that they were reasonable.a description of how appointments are typically 
made to the board is set out below and this was followed in connection with 
the recent appointment of gwyn burr to the board as an independent non

the engagement of independent recruitment consultants (the 
zygos partnership) who have no other connection to 
the company.this helps to 
provide valuable exposure to the board for up and coming management as 
well as being extremely valuable for board members in assessing the 
company’s strength in depth.all board papers are circulated electronically and board 
meetings have been effectively ‘paperless’ for several years, which has 
worked well and aided the overall efficiency of the wider board process.the board also receives regular briefings and updates
