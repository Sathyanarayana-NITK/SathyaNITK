our performance in 2017
the underlying strengths of the intu 
business were much in evidence in 2017 
as we have recorded a robust overall 
performance, confounding the external 
gloom and negativity in pre-brexit uk 
about retail and retail property, and 
showing the success of our asset 
management initiatives and  
strategic positioning.this 
does not, however, prevent us looking at 
innovative debt structures that provide 
the group with diverse funding options.audit committee

risk management process
intu’s board has overall responsibility  
for risk management.seizing the growth 
opportunity in spain
our spanish strategy has been to create 
a business of scale through acquisitions 
and our pipeline of development 
projects, concentrating on the top-10 key 
catchments, where we now own and 
manage three of spain’s top-10 shopping 
centres, with the acquisition of madrid 
xanadú in 2017 (see acquisitions and 
disposals).in july 2017 , we formed a joint venture 
with th real estate for them to take 
ownership of 50 per cent of madrid 
xanadú based on the original  
acquisition price.we look to minimise the level of tax 
risk and at all times seek to comply fully 
with our regulatory and other tax 
obligations and to act in a way which 
upholds intu’s reputation as a responsible 
corporate citizen by regularly carrying out 
risk reviews, seeking pre-clearance from 
hmrc in complex areas and actively 
engaging in discussions regarding 
proposed changes in the taxation system 
that might affect the group.madrid xanadú
