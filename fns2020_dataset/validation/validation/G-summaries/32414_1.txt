report on the group financial statements 
our opinion
in our opinion, accsys technologies plc’s group 
financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 31 march 2017 and of its loss and cash 
flows for the year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards (ifrss) 
as adopted by the european union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the companies act 2006.
what we have audited
the financial statements, included within the annual 
report and financial statements (the ‘annual report’), 
comprise:
•  the consolidated statement of financial position as 
at 31 march 2017;
•  the consolidated statement of other comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
•  the consolidated statement of cash flow for the year 
then ended;
•  the consolidated statement of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; and
•  the notes to the financial statements, which include 
a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.the directors 
believe that while some uncertainty inherently remains in achieving the budget, in particular in relation to market 
conditions outside of the group’s control, that there are a sufficient number of alternative actions and measures 
that can be taken in order to achieve the group’s medium and long term objectives.these include items relating to the restructuring of a significant part of the group, impairment 
losses (or the reversal of previously recorded exceptional impairments), expenditure relating to the integration 
and implementation of significant acquisitions and other one-off events or transactions.the consolidated 
financial statements present the results of the group as if they formed a single entity.the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.for the purposes of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in euro, which is the functional 
currency of the parent company, and the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements.cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset as well as costs of bringing the asset to the working condition and 
location of its intended use.in assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the assets are determined by applying a 
discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows.assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.the recognition of fees 
is based upon an assessment of the work required before the licence is signed and subsequently during the 
construction and commissioning of the licensees’ plant, with an appropriate proportion of the fee recognised 
upon signing and the balance recognised as the project progresses to completion.the recoverable amounts of cash–generating units have been determined based on value 
in use calculations.31. financial instruments

as explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 65, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.in addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit.•  the company has taken advantage of the exemption available under frs 101 and not disclosed related party 
transactions with wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.as permitted under section 408 of the act the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account
