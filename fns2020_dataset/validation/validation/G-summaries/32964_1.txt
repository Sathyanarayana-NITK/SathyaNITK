approach:
the company aims to retain a strong balance sheet and flexibility in our capital structure in order 
to pursue its strategic objectives and underpin future growth.during the year the board spent a 
considerable amount of time reviewing the 
company’s strategy.further information on 
our strategy can be found on pages 10 and 11.
following the results of our 2017 agm, and in 
line with the uk corporate governance code, 
the board undertook to review remuneration.the board and its committees have 
access to the advice and services of the 
general counsel and company secretary 
and may seek advice from independent 
experts at the expense of the company as 
appropriate.murat özgül brings additional 
perspectives to the board’s work through a 
deep understanding of the business and the 
region within which it operates.he reports to the 
chairman and to the board directly.the 
audit committee considers the reports of 
the internal audit function and the external 
auditor and reports to the board on such 
matters as it feels should be brought to the 
board’s attention.pwc have been appointed as the company’s 
auditors for the past six years following a 
tendering process in 2011. in 2016 the audit 
partner was rotated and michael timar was 
appointed as the senior statutory auditor 
to the company.in line with the uk companies act 2006 
(strategic report and directors’ reports) 
regulations 2013 the company prepares and 
reports our greenhouse gas emissions which 
can be found in our corporate responsibility 
section on pages 18 to 21. the committee 
reviewed the greenhouse gas emissions 
occurring from operations in 2017 and 
notes a year-on-year reduction of 12%.in addition, the 
committee invites experts and professionals 
to its meetings as appropriate.with this adjustment, and continued scrutiny 
of all remuneration issues, the committee’s 
intention is to continue to operate within the 
policy for the three-year period following 
its approval.the 2018 performance metrics, seen on 
page 58, reflect the focus of the company 
and the ceo upon the high potential for 
value creation from our assess in miran and 
bina bawi, as well as driving execution of the 
strategy throughout the year.the committee 
chairman reports comprehensively to the 
full board and it is acknowledged that the 
remuneration committee is operating with 
an ever increasing level of transparency.the committee also consulted during the 
year with the chairman (stephen whyte and 
formerly tony hayward), ceo (murat özgül), 
the company secretary (stephen mitchell and 
formerly sarah robertson) and the head of 
human resources (gozde tutanc).in the event that the ceo participates in the mandatory pension plan offered by the 
company the cash supplement will be reduced by the amount contributed by the company into the mandatory pension plan.the thresholds targets have been reviewed and updated after 
consideration of financial developments in 2017. the threshold target is set in line with genel’s cost of capital to ensure that this element vests 
only when shareholders make a return.genel energy

recruitment of chairman and non-executive directors
in the event of the appointment of a new chairman and/or non-executive director, remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with 
those detailed in the relevant table above.unless otherwise approved, an executive director may accept only one position as a non-executive director (but not as a non-executive 
chairman) of a ftse 100 company that is not a competitor of the company, subject to prior notification to the chairman of the company 
and the approval of the board or duly authorised committee thereof.the company considers a variety of factors when considering leaving arrangements for an executive director, including individual and business 
performance, the obligation for the director to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new employment) and other relevant circumstances (e.g.certain additional 
provisions relating to the appointment of 
directors are included in the relationship 
agreement between the company and focus.in particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.this is an area of focus due to the prior year impairments 
recorded on these assets, and the continuing gap between the group’s 
net asset value and its market capitalisation, which may be considered 
an indicator of impairment in isolation.other code provisions
as a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the code, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — the statement given by the directors, on page 42, that they consider the annual report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group obtained in the course of performing our audit.in our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the companies act 2006.
corporate governance statement
the company voluntarily prepares a corporate governance statement that includes the information with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems and about share capital structures required by the disclosure guidance and transparency rules sourcebook of the 
financial conduct authority.items included in the financial information of each of the company‘s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).going concern
at the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 12 months from the balance sheet date and therefore its consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis.the fair value is comprised of entitlement, which is earned under the terms of the relevant psc; orri, 
which is earned on 4.5% of gross field revenue from the tawke licence until july 2022; and royalty income, which is earned on the taq taq 
licence from the company’s partner.for the miran psc and bina bawi pscs, these assets are tested as one cgu (the miran/bina bawi cgu because of the alignment of equity 
interests and current strong linkage between the two assets when both the company assesses delivery of its gas to the midstream and similarly 
when the midstream assesses its commitment of delivery of gas to turkey.an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. annualreport2017
