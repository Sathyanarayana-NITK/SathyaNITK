based on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet their liabilities as they fall due over the period to december 2020. in making this statement the directors have 
considered the resilience of the group, taking account of its current position, the risk appetite, the principal risks facing the 
business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.these signings 
are in line with the strategy at covent garden to 
introduce high quality and interesting concepts to  
the estate.capco continues to restore the estate’s residential 
heritage.by introducing an 
interesting mix of british, global and independent 
brands to address the needs of the consumer, capco aims 
to continue to capture the reversionary income potential 
of the portfolio and achieve erv growth towards its 
target of £125 million by december 2020. 
further to this, capco is focused on making strategic 
investments to expand its ownership of the estate and 
enhancing the customer environment through creative 
asset management.the value of the covent garden estate 
increased by 4.3 per cent (like-for-like) due to the rental growth achieved during the year, with erv up by 4.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis.this includes 24-hour monitoring of cctv and extensive  
patrolling of the estate throughout the day and night.we also 
provide information on some of the management committees 
that support the controls and reporting framework across the 
group and constitute an environment of integrity, transparency 
and openness.during the year, there were a number of changes to the board.the committee 
chairmen attend the agm to answer any questions on the 
committees’ activities.a 
report which summarised the responses to the evaluation was 
considered by the board and it was concluded that the board 
continues to operate well.the committee has therefore recommended to the  
board that pwc be reappointed in 2018.
tendering of external audit contract
capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010, and pwc was 
appointed as group auditors on an annual rolling contract.the policy requires the audit committee chairman  
to approve in advance any non-audit work with a cost exceeding 
£75,000 for work related to the interim review or, for other 
projects, the lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the estimated annual 
level of the auditors’ fees at that time.following an assessment of 
the performance of the chief financial officer, the 
committee noted that he had performed very strongly 
during 2017 and his development in the role had significantly 
exceeded the committee’s expectations.the cost of all benefits will not normally exceed 10 per cent of base 
salary, with the exception of any future expatriate and/or relocation 
benefits, which would be disclosed in the annual report on 
remuneration.the current 
structure of the annual bonus performance 
conditions is illustrated within the annual 
report on remuneration on page 81. the 
financial performance measures and the 
importance of each are set out in the table 
below.the annual financial performance targets 
are set by the committee in the first quarter 
of each year following an analysis of external 
and internal expectations compiled by the 
committee’s independent adviser.outcome of 2017 annual bonus performance measures (audited)
outcome of financial objectives: in respect of the year ended  
31 december 2017, the company’s performance did not meet  
the threshold performance targets for tpr, however the eps target 
was exceeded and nav performance was between threshold and 
maximum.we gained an understanding of the legal and 
regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group which 
were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.as in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.the result of the revaluation this year was a loss of 
£90.9m (2016: loss of £231.2m), which is accounted for within ‘loss 
on revaluation and sale of investment and development property’ and is 
a significant component of the result for the year.how we tailored the audit scope 
we tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate.our specific 
materiality is aligned with the metrics in the consolidated income statement that we believe are of particular interest to the members and 
we determined those metrics to be net rental income and net finance costs.use of this report 
this report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006 and for no other purpose.revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate  
is revised if the revision affects only that period.a property ceases to be recognised as investment and development 
property and is transferred at its fair value to trading property 
when in the directors’ judgement, development commences with 
the intention of sale.if the group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds  
its investment in the joint venture, the group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to 
make payments on behalf of the joint venture.provisions are measured at the 
directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date.financial statements strategic report governance capco annual report & accounts 2017 114
