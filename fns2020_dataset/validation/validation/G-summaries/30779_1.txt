annual report 2017 national express group plc 18 chief executive’s review delivering further significant growth in profit and cash
the strength of the financial  
performance delivered in 2017 
demonstrates the group’s strong  
and stable financial position.overview
against our 2013 baseline, by 2017 we have made excellent progress 
on our traction energy, water and total carbon emissions targets, 
some limited progress on our site energy target, and we have not 
made progress on our waste target.these risks may be industry wide or more specific to the group.the terms on which brexit is negotiated (specifically in relation to the means 
by which any limitation on free movement/immigration is traded off against 
access to the single market) may affect the group’s ability to bid 
competitively within the eu.they underpin  
our business model, are fundamental to the way we work with our 
employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, and guide 
the way we engage with the wider community and environment which 
is affected by our conduct.in today’s business world, particularly given the increasing 
risk, governance and public scrutiny environment, that simply doesn’t 
work, and it doesn’t exist at national express.this increases the 
visibility of the board and provides the non-executives with valuable 
opportunities to engage with local management and employees, and 
increase their working knowledge of the group’s operations and 
market dynamics.the viability statement, and the rationale  
for the period selected, is set out on page 41.

the changes were very well received by shareholders and in 
response to our engagement with them, the committee also made 
the following further amendments to those originally proposed:
 – reduction in the threshold level of ltip vesting from 30% to 25%  
for the tsr and eps elements;
 – extension of the application of malus and clawback to the whole of 
the annual bonus award, not just the deferred share element; and
 – reduction in the group chief executive’s annual pension allowance 
from 35% to 30% of salary in three equal tranches commencing 
from 2019.
a summary of all the key changes proposed to the current policy is 
set out in the table on page 73 and the proposed new policy is set  
out in full on pages 74 to 84.
the committee is confident that the current policy remains fit for 
purpose, subject to the incremental changes being proposed, 
and fundamental in helping us achieve continued strong business 
performance.a new directors’ remuneration policy is being recommended to shareholders at this year’s agm (see page 74).that said, in accordance with the requirements of the code, they (and the executive directors) are required to stand for 
election or re-election by shareholders at each agm and their appointment can be terminated at any time without compensation by either  
party usually by either party serving not less than one month’s prior written notice.for any financial element of the bonus to be payable, the group must 
have achieved at least the threshold level of normalised profit target for the year.corporate governance report strategic report corporate governance financial statements additional information

political contributions
it is the group’s policy not to make political donations and none were 
made in the year (2016: nil).the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and united kingdom accounting standards, including frs 101 “reduced disclosure framework” (united 
kingdom generally accepted accounting practice).estimation of insurance and other claims provisions, including those arising on acquisition, is highly 
judgemental and is based on assessment of the expected settlement of known claims together with  
an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents incurred but not reported at the 
balance sheet date.use of our report
this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006. 
our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.directors’ remuneration 
under the companies act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records  
and returns.we anticipate that our hedging instruments will remain highly effective under ifrs 9 and the group confirms that its current 
hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of the new standard.a revie w of revenue recognition for 
these services confirmed that it is in accordance with ifrs 15, with revenue recognised in the period in which the private hire is provided to the customer.(iv) executive deferred bonus plan 
as detailed in the directors’ remuneration report, the committee considered it appropriate for bonuses awarded in respect of the calendar  
year to be deferred for a period of one year and that these would vest, subject to the terms of the award and the relevant director’s continuing 
employment.cumulative gains on the company’s 
defined benefit pension scheme, which is currently in a net surplus position, are deemed to be not distributable.where required, equivalent disclosures are included 
within the consolidated accounts.this has a number of 
advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds on the actual 
dividend payment date.
