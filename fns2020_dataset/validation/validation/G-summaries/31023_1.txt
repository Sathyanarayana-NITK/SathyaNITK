i am confident i will leave the board and the
company in capable hands.the latter involves
identifying and implementing value enhancement initiatives that
can increase future cash flows to project investors compared to
those originally forecast at the start of the project.the decrease was
primarily due to reductions in operational discount rates for
certain investments and progress in construction, partially
offset by the impact of new investments.the directors of the company use the management reporting
basis when making business decisions, including when
reviewing the level of financial resources and deciding where
these resources should be utilised.for further details of the movement in
fair value on the portfolio, see the portfolio valuation section.negative other fair value movements of £2.1 million for the year
ended 31 december 2017 principally comprised net foreign
exchange losses outside the investment portfolio of £3.9 million
(see the foreign currency exposure section in this review for
further details) and a disposal proceeds adjustment payment
of £3.6 million offset by fair value gains of £0.7 million in
respect of non-portfolio investments in small joint ventures
and £4.7 million of tax income.during the year, cash of £209.9 million (2016 – £301.5 million)
was invested in project companies.the above proceeds were in addition to the
cash received on the acquisition of manchester waste vl co
by the gmwda of £23.5 million.the valuation of the group’s investment portfolio is
affected by movements in foreign exchange rates, which
are reflected through the group’s financial statements.the group monitors the concentration risk within its
portfolio.it supports the valuable work of the welfare team who
look after the needs of former employees and their surviving
partners.health and safety
john laing believes that proper attention to the health and safety
of its employees, subcontractors, and the community within
which the group operates is a key element of effective business
management and sees health and safety as an important
measure of business performance and essential to our reputation.the company complied with the requirements of the code throughout 2017. the code is published by the financial
reporting council (frc) and the full text is available on its website at www.frc.org.uk.the internal audit function provides independent assurance to the board, through the audit & risk committee, that internal
control processes, including those related to risk management, are relevant, effective and have operated across the business
throughout the year.a number of changes were
implemented including the appointment of a dedicated resource in order to improve the quality of risk analysis.tsr relative to the 50% 16 april 2015 to median upper quartile the performance period for the tsr

the discretion to reduce the size of the overall
group bonus if it feels that the level of bonus is
not supported by the underlying financial and
operational performance of the business.any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the annual report on remuneration and may, as
appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the company’s major shareholders.john laing annual report and accounts 2017 / 77

key audit matter
description
the group holds a range of investments which primarily include ppp and renewable energy assets.in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated.in arriving at their conclusion, the directors took into account the group’s approach to liquidity and cash ﬂow
management and the availability of its £475 million corporate banking facilities committed until march 2020, together
with the additional £50 million of liquidity facilities committed until february 2019. the directors are of the opinion that,
based on the group’s forecasts and projections and taking into account expected bidding activity and operational
performance, the group will be able to operate within its bank facilities and comply with the ﬁnancial covenants therein
for the foreseeable future.actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they
occur and are presented in the group statement of comprehensive income.notes to the group financial statements

2 accounting policies (continued)
m) share capital
ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity instruments on the basis that they evidence a residual interest in the assets
of the group after deducting all its liabilities.at 31 december 2017, based on a
sample of seven of the larger renewable energy investments by value, a 5% increase in power price forecasts is estimated to
increase the value of renewable energy investments by £15 million and a 5% decrease in power price forecasts is estimated
to decrease the value of renewable energy investments by £14 million.the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of medical benefits was assumed to be 5.1% in 2017 (2016 – 5.2%).the differences in the amounts of (i) investments at fvtpl and (ii) fair value movements in the year between the company
financial statements (as stated above) and the group financial statements occur because in the latter inter-company
balances arising from the transactions referred to above are eliminated under the normal basis of consolidation, whereas in
the company accounts these inter-company balances are not eliminated.external auditor
(resolutions 11 and 12)
resolutions will be proposed to reappoint deloitte llp as external auditor until the conclusion of the agm in 2019 and to
authorise the directors to determine their remuneration.accordingly, the company believes that the authority contained in this
resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the
john laing group of companies should support.
