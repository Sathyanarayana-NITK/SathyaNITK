dividend
in 2002, we returned to the dividend list with the
payment of a ﬁnal dividend for the 2002 ﬁnancial year.all these aspects of bt exact’s business are based
on expertise and insight created through our research
programmes, which focus on the next-generation
internet, advanced data services, information and
network security, software systems to support the
management and integrity of networks worldwide,
and the future impact of advanced communications
on lifestyles, education and healthcare.the intellectual property created from this work
is valuable and bt exact is responsible for the
exploitation, management and defence of the patents
that result from our research and development work,
and has a policy of commercial exploitation of our
technology through patent licensing (including a
contract with ipvalue to secure revenues from us
and canadian companies), and the incubation of
new technology companies.now that the oftel investigation has
concluded, bt is looking forward to a period of
stability as the use of the new product portfolio
becomes established.in the 2002
ﬁnancial year, the cost transformation programmes
produced savings of £167 million (7%) in selling,
general and administration costs, excluding goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items.higher pension
costs for enhanced beneﬁts provided to leavers and
the annual pay awards were the main reasons
for the increase in staff costs in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.the low charge in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year reﬂects the impact of the demerger of mmo
2
and the impairment of goodwill in the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years which signiﬁcantly reduced the carrying
value of goodwill.bt has the option to purchase the reversionary
interest from telereal (i) when bt vacates a property
at open market value (ii) at the end of 30 years for the
specialised estate (buildings of an operational nature
such as telephone exchanges) at open market value
financial review
bt annual report and form 20-f 2003 39 or (iii) if bt wishes to terminate all arrangements with
telereal at any time, in which circumstances bt would
pay open market values for the property and
compensation to telereal covering funding costs and
equity return.interest cover for continuing activities in the 2003
ﬁnancial year represented 2.6 times total operating
proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, and compares with interest cover of 1.9 in the
2002 ﬁnancial year and 2.4 in the 2001 ﬁnancial year.the principal cash
outﬂow for acquisitions was the completion of the
purchase of a minority interest in esat digifone in april
2001 for £869 million.we have set out further details on this topic and
on our capital resources and foreign currency exposure
in note 36 to the ﬁnancial statements in compliance
with frs 13.
capital resources
during the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years the group
has reduced its level of borrowings so that its net debt
was £9.6 billion at 31 march 2003 compared with
£13.7 billion at 31 march 2002 and £27.9 billion at
31 march 2001. the debt reduction in the 2003 and
2002 ﬁnancial years was achieved by the disposal
of our stake in cegetel, a successful rights issue in
june 2001, the mmo

demerger, sales of investments
and the yell business and the property sale and
leaseback transaction.work continues on enhancing the intelligence
of the network to enable customers to beneﬁt from
advanced services and improving the network’s
capacity to carry high-speed data.capital expenditure
is expected to rise in the 2004 ﬁnancial year as the
group invests in its 21st century network programme.the
equivalent reduction in the previous control year was
2.50% against the required reduction of 2.45%.it reviews
the auditors’ performance, including the scope of
the audit, and recommends to the board appropriate
remuneration.these processes have been in place for the whole
of the 2003 ﬁnancial year and have continued up to
the date on which this document was approved.the awards under the isp held by sir christopher
bland, pierre danon, andy green and paul reynolds
at the end of the 2003 ﬁnancial year are contained
in the table on page 69.
retention shares
retention shares are granted under the retention
share plan (rsp) to individuals with critical skills,
as a recruitment or retention tool.the company paid £19,440
into his personal pension plan plus a cash payment
of £115,560 representing the balance of the pension
allowance for the 2003 ﬁnancial year, which is
included in the table on page 65. bt also provides
him with a lump sum death in service beneﬁt of four
times his salary.it must involve the same currency or similar
currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce
the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on
the group’s operations.this transaction has been accounted for in these ﬁnancial statements using the principles of
merger accounting as if bt had been owned and controlled by btgi throughout the year ended 31 march 2001
and up to 16 november 2001. this is not in accordance with the companies act 1985 since the group
reorganisation does not meet all the conditions for merger accounting.in the following
table, the effective corporation tax rate is reconciled to the proﬁt of £2,169 million before this impairment charge.m
on 22 june 2001, bt completed the sale of the yell group.the counterparty has security over this
investment in the event of bt defaulting on the swap.at 31 march 2003, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other
than those arising in the ordinary course of the group’s business and on these no material losses are anticipated.the btps was closed to new entrants on 31 march 2001 and the age proﬁle of active members will
consequently increase.ssap 24 accounting valuation
the ssap 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis:
& scheme assets are valued at market value; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate
of return reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.the provisions for the costs of the isp, rsp and esp were based on
best estimates of the company’s performance over the plans’ conditional periods, relating to those portions of
the plan conditional periods from commencement up to the ﬁnancial year end.the amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to
interest and exchange rates.during the year ended 31 march 2003, the group entered into two derivatives contracts as an investment in a
uk listed equity, with limited net overall exposure.h
the proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year, dealt with in the proﬁt and loss account of the company and after taking into account dividends from subsidiary
undertakings, was £560 million (2002 – £173 million).the goodwill is reﬂected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain
or loss on divestment.under us gaap, the assets contributed by all joint venture partners are carried at their
historical net book value and any difference between the group’s share of the joint venture’s resulting net assets
and the net book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture is amortised over the life of
the items giving rise to the difference.
