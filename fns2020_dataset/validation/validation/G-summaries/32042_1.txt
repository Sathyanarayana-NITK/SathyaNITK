the timeline for the determination of the final rules and their 
implementation in many of the geographic markets in which the 
group operates remains uncertain.this framework provides the board with assurance that ig’s risks,

responsibilities with respect to risk management activities relating to 
the segregation of client money and assets.the group operates to the highest regulatory standards and leads 
the industry in the way in which it deals with its clients.the ability to attract new clients and the willingness 
of clients to trade depends upon the level of opportunities clients 
perceive are available to them in the markets.the group continues to develop its operational risk framework to 
ensure visibility of risks and controls, clear accountability for controls 
and escalation and reporting mechanisms, through which risk events 
are identified and managed and appropriate action is taken to 
improve controls.we recognise that good conduct is particularly vital in relation  
to marketing and client recruitment, to encourage fair  
consumer outcomes.i would like to thank 
my colleagues for the quality of debate and decision-making 
throughout this period, and in particular the exemplary approach 
of peter and his executive team in continuing to promote and 
evidence the group’s industry-leading commitment to fair client 
outcomes.he is the senior independent

across the key areas of strategy, governance, risk and financial 
performance pursuant to the schedule of matters reserved to the 
board and an agreed annual forward calendar.the board considers factors such as length 
of tenure and relationships or circumstances, which are likely to 
affect or appear to affect the director’s judgment in determining 
whether they remain independent.the annual review of the effectiveness of 
the group’s system of internal controls included reviews of systems 
and controls relating to the financial reporting process.internal controls over financial reporting include procedures and 
policies that:
• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposals of the 
group’s assets
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements 
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management and 
respective directors
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal of 
group assets that could have a material effect on the group’s 
financial statements

best practice in the recruitment process.the scorecard of financial, share price and non-financial metrics may 
vary from year to year in accordance with strategic priorities and the 
regulatory environment.we will, however, disclose the measures and 
targets (where applicable) used, and the extent to which we have 
achieved them, on a retrospective basis, at the end of the relevant

corporate governance statement
in compliance with the uk financial conduct authority’s disclosure 
guidance and transparency rules (dtr) 7.2.1, the disclosures 
required by the dtr are set out in this directors’ report and in the 
corporate governance report.in 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
• state whether applicable ifrss as adopted by the european 
union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• prepare the financial statements on a going-concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
company will continue in business
the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and 
company’s transactions, and to disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the group and company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
directors’ remuneration report comply with the companies act 
2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, article 4 of 
the ias regulation.as a result, the audit work was performed by the group audit team in london, reflecting the 
centralised nature of the business.the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below.the group has made tax payments in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise on these unresolved items, 
however, the amount ultimately payable may be materially lower than the amount already paid and could therefore improve the overall 
profitability and cash flows of the group in future periods.there have been no changes in the valuation techniques for any of the group’s financial instruments held at fair value in the year (year 
ended 31 may 2016: none).trade receivables and payables 
include client and broker balances upon which interest is paid or received based upon market rates.the analysis is based on the assumption that the value of financial investments have increased/decreased by 1% with all other 
variables held constant:
year ended 31 may 2017 year ended 31 may 2016
impact on available for sale reserve (equity) (1.4) (1.4)
the financial impact of such a movement in fair value is considered to be immaterial to the group’s available for sale reserve.if any such indication exists (or at least annually for goodwill), the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
