planning laws, the 
economic environment, availability of capital 
for developers and location choice are some 
of the factors that may impact the group’s 
development and growth plans.with over 100 million customer visits 
a year and over 10,000 employees, the 
group seeks to maintain the highest 
standards in the effective management 
of our health and safety obligations, 
and our duty of care to our customers 
and staff.during 2017 the group awarded a total 
of 19 out of a possible 35 awards from the 
fcpa, demonstrating our dedication to 
the uk’s theatrical protection programme.the increase in average ticket 
price was in part due to price rises 
during the period, but is mainly reflective 
of the continued expansion and 
popularity of premium offerings and 
a result of the renovation programme 
we started three years ago.rest of the world
the results for the row include the 
cinema chain brands – cinema city 
in the central and eastern europe 
territories and yes planet and rav-chen 
in israel.at 31 december 2017 the facility 
remained subject to the existing two 
covenants: the ratio of adjusted ebitda 
(as defined in note 1 to the financial 
statements) to net debt and the ratio 
of ebitdar (pre-rent ebitda) to net 
finance charges.regular briefings by the  
executive management team are given to the board, to 
deepen the collective understanding of the business,  
leading in turn to more effective debate.the chief executive 
officer, deputy chief 
executive officer, and 
chief financial officer 
provide focal points 
for shareholders’ 
enquiries and dialogue 
throughout the year.further details of the committee’s work in relation to the 
appointments of dean moore and nisan cohen are set out 
in the report below.the company receives advice in relation to the remuneration 
policy and its implementation in respect of the chairman, 
executive directors, company secretary and senior management.the committee believes it is appropriate to amend the 
remuneration policy for the following key reasons:
æ æ scale and complexity of the new business – the acquisition 
of regal is anticipated to move the group from a 
multinational operation onto a truly global platform.the annual report on remuneration 
together with this statement is subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the agm on 16 may 2018.
the committee has always aimed to be clear and transparent 
in matters of remuneration, and we hope that this report 
continues this approach.the policy will be put to shareholders for 
approval at the agm in may 2018. if approved it will come into effect from the date of the agm and is intended to apply for 
a period of three years.the acquisition is transformational 
for the group and is expected to deliver significant value to shareholders from an earnings perspective.percentage increases beyond 
those granted to the wider 
workforce may be awarded in 
certain circumstances such as 
where there is a change in 
responsibility, progression in the 
role, experience or a significant 
increase in the scale of the role 
and/or size value and/or 
complexity of the group.malus and clawback
the remuneration committee reserves the discretion to apply ‘malus’ by reducing or withholding annual bonus payments from 
the formulaic outcome based on adjusted ebitda performance (for example, in the event of misconduct or misstatement of 
financial results).following payment, the committee will retain the discretion to ‘claw back’ bonuses in the case of misconduct 
or misstatement of financial results.leaving arrangements under the share and share option schemes vary:
a. under the cineworld group plc 2017 long term incentive plan:
an award will normally lapse upon a participant leaving the employment of the group unless the participant is a ‘good leaver’ 
(including death, injury, ill-health or disability and redundancy) or the remuneration committee in its absolute discretion otherwise 
determines.as described in the 
policy, the annual bonus for the year was determined by a matrix of adjusted ebitda compared to budget, and the achievement 
of specified individual objectives.the choice of these measures reflects the committee’s belief that any incentive compensation 
should be tied both to the overall performance of the group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can 
directly influence.in addition, the strong shareholder support for the regal acquisition was taken into account in relation 
to the investor focused element of the cfo’s objective, and work in relation to the further strengthening of the finance team and 
the success of the shared service centre in poland, delivering significant cost savings to the group.awards made in the year
awards were made to the executive directors under the psp in april 2017. the vesting of these awards will be based on 
cineworld’s three year eps growth performance, as summarised in the table below.financial risk management
the board regularly reviews the financial requirements of the 
group and the risks associated therewith.details 
of the share capital, and changes in it over the year, are shown 
in note 20 to the financial statements.the components within the scope of our work accounted for 
the percentages illustrated opposite.4 we have nothing to report on going concern
we are required to report to you if:
• 
we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the group and company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; or
 •
the related statement under the listing rules set out on 
page 34 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.consolidated statement of profit or loss
