misconduct that goes or appears to go against the company’s internal code of conduct and our institutional values.being part of the same group also provides an opportunity for synergistic benefits to be achieved operationally and

currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.(o) leases

nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
