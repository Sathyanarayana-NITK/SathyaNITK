financial statements
we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of £38,000,  
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.3. significant accounting policies
basis of accounting
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrss) adopted by the 
european union and therefore the group financial statements comply with the aim rules.the classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets  
and is determined at the time of initial recognition.financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced.the 
group takes advantage of the simpler approach offered by global accounting under the margin scheme.leases are classified  
as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.employee benefit trust shares
under the terms of the group long term incentive plan (‘ltip’) for the directors, the parent company issued certain shares to an 
employee benefit trust, paid for through the issuance of a loan to the trust from the group.the commission receivable on cheque cashing is recognised at the time of the transaction.buyback revenue is recognised at the 
point of sale of the item back to the customer.two (2016: none) of the directors 
exercised options over shares in the company in the year.loans where the pawn agreement 
has terminated but the customer has not redeemed the assets) at the reporting date since the realisable value of the security held  
is greater than the carrying value of the pledge loan as disclosed above.the group is therefore 
exposed to adverse movements in the price of gold on the value of the security that would be attributable for sale in the event  
of default by the borrower.employee benefit trust shares reserve
the group presents these conditional shares as an adjustment to own equity at the balance sheet date through the employee benefit 
trust shares reserve, until the point that the shares are awarded, and cease to be conditional awards of shares.historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the goods and services.
