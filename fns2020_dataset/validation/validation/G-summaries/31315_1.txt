the decrease from 2016 is largely 
driven by the acquisition of te2, which currently derives the majority of its revenues from professional services, but remains at a level 
that gives the board the continued confidence to innovate to extend our product leadership and provides the opportunity to 
outperform revenue expectations through winning new business.this includes an initial beneficial impact to the 
group of changes to the us tax code that were introduced via the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 resulting in a revaluation of us 
deferred tax assets and liabilities to incorporate the reduction in the headline federal tax rates.in addition, the group continues to seek appropriate complementary acquisitions to reduce reliance on specific 
customers, sectors or geographies.although the majority of expenditure is also 
denominated in this currency, there remains an exposure to movements between the us dollar and either sterling, euros, the 
australian dollar, the brazilian real, the mexican peso or the canadian dollar.it is considered that the composition and size of the board does not warrant the appointment of a nominations committee and 
appointments are dealt with by the board as a whole.accesso technology group plc

the group's policy is one of equal opportunity in the selection, training, career development and promotion of staff.it 
reviews the performance of the executive directors, sets their remuneration, considers the grant of options under any of the share 
option scheme and ensures that the executive directors are properly rewarded and motivated.performance and decisions on remuneration taken in 2017  
 
salaries are normally reviewed annually, in march, and any change applied retrospectively to the beginning of the year.for 2017, the bonus awarded to the executive chairman and ceo was 120% (maximum: 150%) of base pay and for the cfo was 100% 
(maximum: 120%) of base pay.15 april 2015 36 6 cagr of share price for maximum vesting of award: 15%

prior to the release date (“asp”) is 864.37 pence or more.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the companies act 2006.  they are responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.for 
replacement cost models the key 
assumptions are those relating to cost 
inputs and the relevant mark ups 
applied and for cash flow models, 
attrition and gross margin; 
— assessing transparency: we 
assessed whether the group’s 
disclosures of the critical judgments 
reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of these intangible assets.the work on all 6 of the components (2016: all 4 of the components), including the audit of the parent company, was performed by 
the group team.the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.the following areas are those management anticipate may have the greatest impact or are the most judgemental under the 
new standard: 
 
queuing revenue 
the group has developed virtual queuing technology which enables guests to virtually queue using proprietary software and 
hardware.any costs directly attributable to the business combination are 
written off to the group income statement in the period incurred.in relation to virtual queuing, the group contracts with theme park operators to offer the technology and service to park 
guests and share the profit or revenue generated by purchases by park guests.revenue in relation to point of sale and guest management software licences is earned via installing software onto a 
customer’s owned-hardware and giving the customer the ability to use the software.employee benefits 
 
share-based payment arrangements 
the group issues equity-settled share-based payments to full time employees.deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
 
• the same taxable group company; or 
• different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax 
assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.the significant 
intangibles recognised by the group and their useful economic lives are as follows: 
 
• trademarks over 3 years 
• patents over 20 years 
• customer relationships and supplier contracts over 1 to 15 years 
• intellectual property over 5 to 7 years 
 
internally generated intangible assets and research and development 
 
expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that: 
• it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold; 
• adequate resources are available to complete the development; 
• there is an intention to complete and sell the product; 
• the group is able to sell the product; 
• sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and 
• expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.employee benefit trust (ebt)  
 
as the company is deemed to have control of its ebt, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the 
consolidated financial statements.accesso technology group plc

critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued) 
 
judgements 
 
information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts 
recognised in these consolidated financial statements are below: 
 
capitalised development costs 
the group capitalises development costs in line with ias 38, intangible assets.significant judgements include the 
technical feasibility of the development, recoverability of the costs incurred, and economic viability of the product and 
potential market available considering its current and future customers.key assumptions and estimates made in valuing the acquired intangible assets include: 
• cash flow forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition, which involve estimating future business volumes; 
• the discount rate applied to the forecasted future cash flows; and 
• the costs to recreate the asset.as the group’s cgus have become more interrelated, and 
acquisitions are made with the intention of platform integration, the allocation of goodwill is monitored across the cgus.as a result, the group’s exposure to bad debts 
is generally not significant due to the nature of its trade and relationships with customers.the group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for current and future shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to minimise the cost of capital.given the nature of 
the group’s operations and their management of foreign currency exposure, they limit the potential down side risk as far as 
practicably possible.the value of the ticket, less the commission, is payable to the supplier of the ticket, 
and is not revenue to the group.the agreement has a four-year 
term, with a $10m reduction in the total available for drawdown on the first, second and third anniversaries of the 
restatement.equity-settled share option schemes
