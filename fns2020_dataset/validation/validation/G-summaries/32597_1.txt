the uk’s eu referendum vote and subsequent weakening of 
sterling created currency-related revenue and margin 
opportunities as our products became cheaper in europe, 
although our european revenue had already grown at 138% 
over the first four months of fy17 that preceded the vote.in addition, the group will likely have to compete in new 
jurisdictions with companies already operating in the relevant 
market, which may understand the local market better than  
the group.the directors believe that the relative 
size of the group, its purchase volumes 
and the strength of its relationship  
with the brand owners, built over a 
prolonged period in many cases, make 
it unlikely that any such arrangements 
would be terminated.the processes 
have been in place from 1 march 2016 to 
the date of approval of the annual report 
and accounts, and is consistent with the 
guidance for directors on internal control 
issued by the turnbull committee.the committee receives reports from 
management on the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls.it also receives 
from the external auditor a report of 
matters arising during the course of the 
audit which the auditor deems to be  
of significance for the committee’s 
attention.the statement on internal 
controls and the management of risk, 
which is included in the annual report,  
is approved by the committee.directors’ interests
