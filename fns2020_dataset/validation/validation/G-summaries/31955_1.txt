risk management and 
internal control systems
in accordance with the principles of the 
uk corporate governance code, the 
board is ultimately responsible for the 
group’s risk management and internal 
control systems and for reviewing their 
effectiveness.ashmore’s 
csr programme and initiatives are designed 
to be relevant to the nature and scale of its 
business and to protect and reinforce the 
group’s reputation and integrity.approach
the ashmore foundation’s focus of work 
is designed in response to the fact that, 
despite economic growth in emerging 
markets, disadvantaged communities 
in many countries remain affected by 
poverty and lack access to basic services 
and opportunities that are basic rights and 
could greatly improve their life situations.one of the most important features of the 
ashmore operating model is the distinctive 
and highly effective remuneration model, 
which attracts and retains high-quality 
employees and aligns interests with 
clients and shareholders.governance

the members of the remuneration committee 
have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the company to 
enable them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively, and met six times 
during the year.the committee 
considered there were no events or circumstances that would have 
made it appropriate to recoup remuneration during the year ending 
30 june 2017. 
 
main features of the proposed  
remuneration policy  
  ashmore group plc | annual report and accounts 2017 57 
base salary  
in a business where the majority of costs are 
employee-related, a low cap on base salaries, 
currently set at £120,000, seeks to ensure 
that fixed costs are minimised, and it delivers 
a ratio of ceo to median employee pay 
that is very low relative to the uk market.variable remuneration, including 
matching shares 
the group operates a simple variable 
remuneration structure for all employees 
including executive directors, based on a 
single annual profit-derived bonus pool that 
is capped at 25% of earnings before variable 
remuneration, interest and tax.1

financial statements 
1) general information 
ashmore group plc (the company) is a public limited company listed 
on the london stock exchange and incorporated and domiciled in  
the united kingdom.the company has taken advantage of the exemption in section  
408 of the companies act 2006 that allows it not to present its 
individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes.consistent accounting policies have 
been applied across the group in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements as at 30 june 2017. 
a change in the ownership interest of a consolidated entity that  
does not result in a loss of control by the group is accounted for as  
an equity transaction.investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are 
measured using the equity method of accounting.if the group concludes that it does not have control 
over the fund, the group accounts for its interest in the fund as a 
financial asset.the acquisition date is the date  
on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are measured 
as the difference between cost and the current fair value.where 
there is evidence that the available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, 
the cumulative loss that had been previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified from the available-for-sale  
fair value reserve and recognised in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.interest on the impaired asset continues to be 
accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original 
effective interest rate of the asset.the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial 
instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows.when determining the 
inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the 
source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would 
take place between market participants on the measurement date.included within finance income are net gains of £9.3 million (fy2015/16: net gains of £4.2 million) in relation to held for sale investments.it is the intention of the directors to make these shares available to employees through the share-based 
compensation plans.an assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to 
calculate the effect on post-tax profits.movements in investments in associates and joint ventures during the year were as follows:
