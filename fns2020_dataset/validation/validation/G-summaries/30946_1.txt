the prior year results were impacted by the reduction in the personal injury discount rate (the ogden rate) which is used to 
settle large personal injury claims.the three year plan is based 
on the board’s strategy, risk appetite 
and assessment of the principal risks 
as detailed on page 48, as well as how 
these are managed.these committees receive 
timely, up to date reports on the 
material movement of risk, from the 
oversight functions, whether influenced 
by external or internal monitoring and 
audits or events, or by any material 
shift in business risk that is linked to 
the successful delivery of the three 
year plan.during the year there have been a 
number of enhancements to the way 
the group manages its risks.the directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.the roles and 
responsibilities of the chairman, chief executive officer and 
senior independent director are clearly defined and allocated.all directors receive an induction on joining the board 
which is tailored to the individual needs of each director; 
where a director is joining a board committee the induction 
includes an overview of the operation of that committee.throughout 
the year the board and committees receive regular updates 
from the executive directors and senior executives of 
key developments in the business as part of their formal 
meetings.the board has four committees, 
audit, nomination, remuneration and risk; all of their terms 
of reference were reviewed by the relevant committee and 
approved by the board.board and committee attendance
details of the number of meetings of the company‘s board and 
committees held during the year and the attendance of each 
director (in office between 1 january 2017 and 31 december 
2017) at those meetings are set out below.no one individual should have 
unfettered powers of decision
 • the chairman is responsible for leadership of the board and ensuring its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role
 • as part of their role as members of a unitary board, non-executive directors 
should constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy

b. effectiveness • the board and its committees should have the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the company to enable them 
to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively
 • there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the board
 • all directors should be able to allocate sufficient time to the company to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively
 • all directors should receive an induction on joining the board and should 
regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge
 • the board should be supplied in a timely manner with information in a form 
and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties
 • the board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its committees and individual directors
 • all directors should be submitted for re-election at regular intervals,  
subject to continued satisfactory performance

c. accountability • the board should present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the company’s position and prospects
 • the board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives.the committee welcomed the letter dated 10 october 2017 
from the frc addressed to all audit committee chairmen and 
finance directors.the performance of committee members and the 
committee chairman were also reviewed.significant issues related to the 
financial statements 
other than the areas of significant judgement described 
above, there were no other significant issues related to the 
financial statements considered by the committee and 
discussed with the external auditor during the year and in 
relation to the 31 december 2017 year end.the committee has, 
where necessary, taken the initiative in requesting information 
in order to provide the constructive challenge appropriate 
for its role.the committee considered who would be best 
placed to assume the role of company chairman and the 
committee agreed that continuity and stability along with 
balancing the needs of strong independent governance 
and effective strategic leadership were key parameters for 
potential candidates given the current development of the 
group.the committee 
discussed the relative merits of potential external candidates 
who were considered alongside potential internal candidates.the committee 
recommended to the board, two external candidates 
as potential successors to gary along with two internal 
candidates.the committee noted that the independent non-executive 
directors on the board have not yet reached the end of their 
first term of office and that the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the company by these 
directors remains appropriate.herman bosman was appointed to the board 
on 14 march 2017. the committee confirmed the appointment 
of herman bosman under the terms of that relationship 
agreement.role

the remuneration committee for the

anticipated role and responsibilities of the chairman, the 
remuneration committee determined that the chairman fee 
be set at £250,000 per annum.in accordance with the plan rules (the full terms of which can 
be found in the company’s listing prospectus), outstanding 
deferred bonus and ltip awards will continue on the same 
terms, reflecting gary’s continued services to the company.2017 has seen strong financial performance for the company, including:
 • 21% growth in adjusted operating profit, after adjusting for the £20m impact of the  
ogden rate adjustment in 2016;
 • calendar year loss ratio outperforming against the target range;
 • continued progress on guidewire implementation; and
 • met wider financial targets including debt/ebitda multiple and free cash flow.the cost of other benefits is dependent 
on the terms of the relevant provider.at the end of the 
year, the committee meets to review individual 
and corporate performance against objectives 
and determines payout levels.the	amount	charged	to	profit	or	loss	in	respect	of	pension	costs
