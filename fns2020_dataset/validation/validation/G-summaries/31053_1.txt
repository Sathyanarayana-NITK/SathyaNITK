once again my sincere thanks go 
to our shareholders, our customers, 
our management, staff and all other 
stakeholders, who have strongly supported 
scisys in 2017. the group has continued 
to make excellent progress during the 
year and we are confident in our ability to 
deliver further progress in 2018: expanding 
the business in a sustainable, resilient, 
balanced way for the benefit of our 
shareholders, customers and staff.the reduction reflects provisions in the 
standard whereby only the mark-up on third-
party costs can be recognised as revenue in 
situations where scisys acts in the capacity 
of an agent, simply passing the third-party’s 
goods and services to customers through its 
books.our position
the scisys space division enjoys a solid 
reputation in the space sector for delivering 
projects on time and to budget.the year in review
the division’s revenues achieved 
expectations and divisional goals with top-line 
sales remaining stable.we are well positioned to extend 
our footprint in the armoured vehicles 
sector, following from previous work on the 
warrior upgrade and ongoing research and 
development contracts.another area of 
demand is for greater integration between 
the playout and the mixing desk, which we 
have responded to by producing a touch-
screen solution.annova felt comfortable being part of the 
scisys group from day one, not only gelling 
with the m&b teams but also with the space 
and esd divisions.the key applications are on virtualised 
platforms to ensure they can be redistributed 
to another location or, ultimately, to the cloud 
if necessary in the event of a significant 
outage at an office location.we 
encourage all our subsidiaries to support the 
needs of their communities by contributing to 
charities and community initiatives.scisys recognises that it has a role to play in 
case study – brexit in the uk
scisys recognises that the ongoing brexit 
negotiations and associated changes in 
immigration policies resulting from britain’s 
leaving the eu are likely to be of concern to our 
uk employees from the eu, as well as british 
employees with partners or children who are eu 
nationals.the 
minutes of the committee meetings are available to all directors and 
verbal briefings are given at board meetings.remuneration committee
sets the remuneration of the directors, including basic salary, bonuses and other 
incentivisation payments and awards.i look forward to your support for the 
resolution seeking approval of the 
remuneration report at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting.we have 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and 
are independent of the group in accordance 
with, uk ethical requirements including 
the frc ethical standard as applied to 
listed entities.the degree of completion is measured by 
reference to costs incurred at the balance 
sheet date as a percentage of the total 
estimated costs to complete the project.4. we have nothing to report on going concern
we are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of 
the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an 
undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over 
the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements.the directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis due to the healthy position of 
the order book and the availability of committed borrowing facilities 
that provide adequate headroom over forecast working capital 
requirements for 2018.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrss 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses.when the group’s share of losses 
exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the group’s 
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is 
discontinued except to the extent that the group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.revenue from the sale of third-party products is recognised on 
transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership and when:
•  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow;
•  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; and
•  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can 
be measured reliably.the group has taken advantage of the exemption available under 
ifrs 1 to deem the cumulative translation differences for all 
investments in foreign operations to be zero at 1 january 2006, the 
date of transition to adopted ifrs.management 
estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
cgus.the waccs for each of the space, media & broadcast and annova cgus are not considered 
to be materially different due to the comparable nature of their operations and customer bases.the annova cgu has been reviewed for impairment for the first time 
in 2017. on the basis of this analysis, the directors consider that no impairment provision is warranted.at 31 december 2017, the group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 
£7,000 (2016: £20,000).the following table summarises the financial information of tomm apps as included in its own financial statements, adjusted for fair value 
adjustments at acquisition and differences in accounting policies:  corporate governance financial statements strategic report
