misconduct, miscalculation or risk taking in excess of that

government grants
government grants are recognised where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with.non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at 
the lower of their carrying amount immediately prior to being 
classified as held for sale in accordance with the group’s 
accounting policy and fair value less costs to sell.the stobart energy segment specialises in the supply of 
sustainable biomass for the generation of renewable energy.in order for the estimated recoverable amount of 
the cgu to be equal to the carrying amount the discount rate 
would need to be individually increased by 6.9 percentage points 
(2016: 6.2 percentage points).during the year, the group disposed of two investment 
properties, realising net proceeds of £45,371,000 and a profit on 
disposal of £11,716,000.the pre-tax 
discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 9.6% 
(2016: 8.9%) based on the weighted average cost of capital for 
the cgu, taking into account the cost of equity and debt for the 
cgu, and adjusting for risk specific to the cgu.no impairment 
losses have been recognised and in order for the estimated 
recoverable amount of the cgu to be equal to the carrying 
amounts the discount rate would need to be individually 
increased by 12.2 percentage points (2016: 16.5) to 22.4%  
(2016: 22.7%) and management believes that no reasonably 
possible change in cash flows would cause the carrying value  
of the cgu to exceed its recoverable amount.reasons for the 
increase in some of the discount rates include an increase in cost 
of debt, the inclusion of a size premium and variations in gearing 
and beta values for comparative companies used to calculate 
cost of equity.during the current year, a portion of this property was sold, 
generating a profit on disposal of £2,747,000, with the remainder 
being transferred to inventory as disposal is not expected within 
the next 12 months.principal financial instruments
the principal financial instruments used by the group, from which 
financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• trade and other receivables • cash at bank
• bank overdrafts • trade and other payables
• floating-rate bank loans • finance leases
general objectives, policies and processes
