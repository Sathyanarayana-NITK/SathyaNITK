of the company’s website.each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the directors’ report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• the company financial statements, which have been prepared

and company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.these matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.these, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.after making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for at least one year from the date of these financial statements.ias 38 “intangible assets” has been implemented, which has led to capitalisation of staff costs related to development of computer 
software used by the business.revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability 
to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.the basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial asset.adjustments are made to eliminate the profit 
or loss arising on transactions with associates to the extent of the group’s interest in the entity.(ii) transactions and balances
transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.(iii) group companies
the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; 
(b)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of each transaction); and 
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.the exact revenue for each campaign is set 
out in the relevant insertion (purchase) order which shows the agreed number of advertising units or insertions to be delivered.where a fixed or minimum revenue value is specified in the contract, this is recognised over the duration of the agreement in line with 
the agreed performance criteria where these have been specified.development costs that are 
directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible 
assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.where appropriate, transactions 
of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the 
transactions on the group historical financial information.for the year ended december 2017 the revaluation 
loss on foreign subsidiary net assets recognised in the statement of comprehensive income was £14,088 (2016: £133,270).the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.therefore regions considered for segmental reporting are where the company and subsidiaries are based, namely the uk, the usa, 
india, brazil, china and singapore.the amount of revenue from external customers by location of the group billing
