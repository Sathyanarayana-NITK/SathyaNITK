notes to the consolidated financial statements
principal accounting policies
basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements of uls technology plc and its subsidiaries (together, “the group”) have been prepared  
in accordance with international financial reporting standards (“ifrs”), as adopted by the eu, ifric interpretations and with 
those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs.amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted  
where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the group.profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the 
effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.typically, for a conveyancing transaction, this will be on completion of the property transaction 
and if the transaction falls through prior to completion, the customer does not have to pay.recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.inventories
work in progress is valued on the basis of direct costs attributable to jobs under completion at the reporting date.the amount of the provision 
is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at original 
effective interest rate.financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 
asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred.upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are allocated to share capital 
up to the nominal (par) value of the shares issued with any excess being recorded as share premium.the most commonly applied is the achievement of forecast 
profitability.uls technology annual report 2017 44
