brief biographical details for all the 
members of the committee are 
included on pages 42 and 43.
the audit committee provides 
effective governance over external 
financial reporting, risk management 
and internal controls and reports its 
findings and recommendations to the 
board.the committee also assesses the 
process that has been established 
to ensure that the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable, 
reporting to the board on their findings.the proposal was approved by the committee and incorporates the 
establishment of a minimum controls framework, against which internal audit testing will be focused.key estimates
the audit committee discusses 
with management and the auditor 
the approach that has been taken in 
assessing all key estimates.therefore, the committee is taking 
a prudent approach to james’ salary 
progression by phasing the increases.philip dayer will be standing down at the agm on 7 july and jennifer allerton will succeed him as the chair of the 
remuneration committee.jennifer has been a member of the remuneration committee since 2013. 
the role of the committee is set out in its terms of reference which are available on the company’s website at 
www.aveva.com.annual incentive scheme
for 2017 /18, the maximum opportunity for executive directors under the annual incentive will continue to be 125% of base 
salary although the out-performance element has been incorporated into the core scheme, albeit still requiring a stretch level 
of performance for full payout.the board believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, the targets 
are market sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance, but ordinarily will be disclosed retrospectively.– due to commercial sensitivity, the committee does not believe it to be in shareholders’ interests to prospectively 
disclose details of the revenue growth targets.richard’s accrued entitlements under the pension scheme are as follows:

the scope of our audit 
tailoring the scope
our assessment of audit risk, our 
evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality 
determine our audit scope for each

scoped out malaysia and japan from the 
specific scope category and scoped in 
sweden as part of our rotational scope 
for the smaller components  
of the group.we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
–  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
–  the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
