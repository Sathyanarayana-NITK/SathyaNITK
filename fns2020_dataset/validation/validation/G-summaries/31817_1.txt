the group operates a hybrid strategy of technology 
licensing non-exclusively to dow and merck and own 
manufacture and direct supply to service the display 
industry.this revenue is expected to be recognised 
as follows:
year ending 31 july £ million
2016 – actual —
2017 – actual 0.5
2018 to 2023 0.7
total 1.2
the invoices for the upfront payments were settled 
in the first half of the 2017 financial year.there were no open forward contracts as at 
31 july 2017 (2016: none).further information about its employment 
policies is outlined below.the board is committed to ensuring that 
high standards of corporate governance 
appropriate for the group’s size are 
maintained by nanoco.since the year end non-audit 
services provided to the group by the 
auditor amounted to £25,000 (2016: £nil) 
and comprised a further review of the 
working capital statement required

independence assessment 
by the audit committee
the committee was satisfied that 
safeguards were maintained regarding 
the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor.(i)  the committee reviewed the revenue 
recognition policies adopted in these 
accounts and determined that the 
treatment was appropriate as it 
reflects the substance of the licence 
agreements.the role of the 
executive directors is to implement the 
board’s policies on risk and control and 
provide assurance on compliance with 
these policies.some key features of the internal control 
system are that:
(i)  annual budgets and rolling forecasts 
are reviewed and approved by 
the board;
(ii)  monthly management accounts 
information is compared and 
reconciled with budgets;
(iii)  the group has written operational, 
accounting and employment policies 
in place;
(iv)  the board actively identifies and 
evaluates the risks inherent in the 
business and ensures that appropriate 
controls and procedures are in place 
to manage these risks;
(v)  the group has well established 
financial reporting and approval 
systems and procedures which cover 
all key transactional processes and 
group commitments; and
(vi)  the group has a uniform system 
of investment appraisal.as a result of deficiencies identified last 
year, additional procedures have been 
introduced by the audit committee to 
ensure that revenue recognition is 
correctly determined as part of the 
process of agreeing new licences and 
other technical areas of ifrss are properly 
applied.the developing of a market 
takes time and the resulting financial 
achievement reflecting all the effort 
only comes in the future.the committee may decide 
not to operate deferral if it is determined that the 
amount to be deferred is too small to warrant the 
administrative burden.under the ltip , there will be no retesting of performance 
following the end of the performance period.for these purposes, “payments” includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, 
the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.under the performance underpin if the committee is not satisfied 
that appropriate progress has been made across the business it will have the discretion to cancel all or some of the ltip award.the committee expects executive directors to have met the shareholding guideline policy by the 
fifth anniversary of their appointment as an executive director.both dr michael edelman and dr nigel pickett hold shares substantially in excess of the shareholding guideline (607% and 2,378% 
of salary respectively using the three-month average closing share price to the end of july 2017).date of letter of

corporate governance
the directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the group and parent company for the year ended 31 july 2017.
financial instruments
details of the group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are disclosed in note 26 to the financial statements.as at 31 july 2017 share capital comprised 238.3 million ordinary shares of 10 pence each (2016: 237.1 million).full details of the group’s and company’s share capital movements during the period are given 
in note 21 to the financial statements.the company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on voting rights and the transfer 
of securities.under company law the directors must not 
approve the group financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the group and of the profit or loss of the 
group for that period.we understood and assessed the design and implementation 
of the key controls around the revenue recognition process.matters on which we are required to report by exception
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.70
financial statements
responsibilities of directors
as explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 64, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.•
the non-audit services prohibited by the frc’s ethical standard were not provided to the group or the parent company 
and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.the basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the effect of share options is anti-dilutive.even in the worst case 
scenario whereby the group achieves no cash revenues for the twelve months following the date of this annual report, the company 
and the group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.as the group has not, to date, made a profit the 
carrying value of these assets may need to be impaired.as at 
the reporting date the company operated with only a single segment, being the research, development and manufacture of products 
and services based on high performance nanoparticles.the amounts charged against profits represent the contributions payable to the scheme in 
respect of the accounting period.no te s t o the financial s tatements continued strategic report corporate governance financial statements
