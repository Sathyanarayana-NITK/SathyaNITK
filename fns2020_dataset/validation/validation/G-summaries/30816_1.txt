following the half year results in september 2017, institutional investor demand was sufficiently strong 
that the board were able to recommend a new share placing, raising £5.7m of equity finance (before 
costs) at a price of 143.5 pence per share.this 
lack of dedicated resources has historically held back the rate of new customer acquisition, particularly 
in the us, where our addressable market is four or five times that of the uk.cloudcall group plc

outlook 
as we continue to grow our recurring revenue, it is clear that growth in the first half of the year has a 
far greater cumulative impact on the year’s total revenue number than growth in the latter part of a 
year.i’m therefore pleased to announce that whilst we don’t expect to see full contribution from our 
newly hired sales heads until q2, our existing sales team have had a strong january and february and 
that trading is in line with expectations.simon cleaver

performance is regularly reviewed and training, mentoring, support and career development 
provided wherever necessary and appropriate.the foreign exchange risk is partly 
addressed by matching income and costs denominated in us dollars monthly, although as the value of 
the inter-company payable between cloudcall, inc. and its parent cloudcall limited continues to grow, 
it becomes ever more sensitive to fx movements between usd and gbp on translation.interest rate risk 
under the revolving credit facility agreement with barclays, dated 17 july 2017, the group is exposed 
to interest rate risk such that a change in the uk base rate of interest will directly increase or decrease 
the interest payable on any funds drawn down under the terms of the facility, although the board notes 
that this impact is not expected to be material.after an initial five years with us company pitney bowes and having worked at 
length in the formative telecoms sector with acc, redstone telecom and band-x, andrew went on to 
lead successful revenue turnaround and change management initiatives in managed solution and 
software markets, from senior roles within redstone managed solutions and magnetic north ltd.
