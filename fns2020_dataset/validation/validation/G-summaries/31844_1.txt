recruitment and promotions
the remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s remuneration 
policy at the time of the appointment.the company also purchased and maintained throughout the financial year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.the directors consider that the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group and company’s performance, business model and strategy.each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the board of directors section on pages 36 and 37 confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with united kingdom generally accepted accounting 
practice (united kingdom accounting standards, comprising frs 101 ‘reduced disclosure framework’, and applicable law),  
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;
• the group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the group; and
• the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group and 
company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.other than those disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the group or the company

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.we used 
0.35% of revenue as the benchmark for  
our materiality calculations due to the  
low margin nature of the business and  
our judgement around what would affect  
the decisions of the members.our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the uk corporate governance code (the ‘code’); and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit.financial statements ii i
