notes to the financial statements 
1 general information  
transense technologies plc (the “company”) is a company incorporated in the united kingdom under the 
companies act 2006. the address of the registered office is given on page 3. the consolidated financial 
statements of the company as at and for the year ended 30 june 2017 comprise the company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as “the group” and individually as “group entities”).2 basis of preparation 
both the parent company financial statements and the group financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu 
(“adopted ifrss”) and those parts of the companies act 2006 that are relevant to companies preparing accounts 
under ifrs.on publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the group financial 
statements, the company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the companies act 2006 not to present 
its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial 
statements.significant accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty 
certain estimates and judgements need to be made by the directors which affect the results and position of the 
group as reported in the financial statements.the following judgements and 
estimates have been identified by the group: 
 
• determining when intangible assets are impaired is a judgement which requires an estimate of the value in use 
of the asset based on management’s best estimate of the future cash flows that the assets are expected to 
generate.the group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the 
non-controlling interests based on their respective ownership interests.revenue and ebitda are the group’s key focus and in turn is the main performance measure adopted 
by management.transense technologies plc

research and development 
expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.goodwill represents amounts 
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries and is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.the fair value so determined is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.finance lease income is recognised as revenue in the period to reflect a constant 
periodic rate of return on the company’s remaining net investment in respect of the lease.18 trade leases and unearned finance income 
 
the group offers its itrack solution to be sold via a finance lease, in which a significant portion of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee.credit risk is considered to be low given the cash position of the group and that there is a low 
exposure level in the trade and other receivables.
