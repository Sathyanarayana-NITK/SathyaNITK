and an additional fee for any specific board 
responsibility such as membership or chairmanship of 
a committee or occupying the role of senior 
independent director.total fees paid to non-executive directors will remain 
within the limits stated in the articles of association.benefits

with the market and level of seniority.the calculation of tsr performance from the start of the performance period on 1 april 2014 to 10 may 2017 was undertaken by deloitte llp for

end of the performance period (1 april 2017 to 30 june 2017) the achievement and the outturn is an estimate at the date of calculation (11 may 2017)
vesting of an award is also subject to the ‘underpin’ described on page 80 which the committee has determined to the date of this report would 
be satisfied.this is the conventional method 
for parent companies and subsidiaries within a group that have the 
ability to direct financial and operating policies and retain the majority 
of the organisation’s risk and rewards.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the group and the company; and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the companies act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, article 4 of the international accounting 
standards (ias) regulation.in addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial 
statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.the determination of the

all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report

financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.respective responsibilities of directors and auditor

year, together with a review of cgu business performance against expectations.non-underlying items

an agreed payment date of june 2018. the impact for the group is a net cost of £35 million post tax.the

market price of the company’s ordinary shares during the year; and the contingently issuable shares under the group’s performance and co-investment 
plan and the deferred shares element of the annual incentive bonus plan, to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are 
expected to be met.the significant inputs into the valuation model at the date of issue of the options were:
