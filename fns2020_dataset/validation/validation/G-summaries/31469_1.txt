opinion arises between the group and a local tax authority in respect of its tax filings, the group will debate the contentious areas and, 
where necessary, resolve them through negotiation or litigation.48 g4s plc integrated report and accounts 2017 restructuring

board composition
in january 2017, the nomination committee met to 
discuss the adjustments that should be made to the 
composition of the audit committee following the 
sudden onset of a medical condition, which prevented 
ian springett from taking on his role as chair of the  
audit committee.clare spottiswoode having indicated 
that she would not seek re-election at the company’s 
2018 agm, the committee initiated a search for a new 
responsibilities
the nomination committee’s remit covers broadly five 
areas, namely, board composition, making 
recommendations to the board on appointments with  
a view to maintaining a balance of skills and experience 
on the board and its committees, succession planning, 
board performance evaluation and annual reporting.conclusion
the committee was satisfied with the group’s  
processes and approach to foreign ownership and 
consolidation of undertakings.further details on 
separately disclosed items are set out in note 8. 
action taken
the audit committee reviewed and challenged, in light 
of the guidance issued by the frc in december 2013, 
october 2016 and november 2017, and the results of 
the frc review of the 2016 integrated report and 
accounts, the enhanced disclosures prepared by 
management in the 2017 integrated report and 
accounts (pages 35 and 36) in relation to alternative 
performance measures (apms) and specific items.the committee also reviewed information from 
management to satisfy itself that changes in estimates 
related to items that were classified as specific items 
were treated equally and consistently as specific  
items, in particular for both increases and decreases  
of provisions.the committee reviewed information prepared by 
management supporting the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets, considered the period of time under which 
these assets would be recovered and made enquiries  
of the external auditor on the appropriateness of the 
group’s tax position.over the course of the last four years the group has 
made significant investment in strengthening capability in 
finance, internal audit and risk, and has introduced 
additional internal controls and enhanced group 
oversight to mitigate these risks.our leadership team continues to 
demonstrate commitment to the long-term success  
of the business and i am pleased to report that they 
produced core business revenue growth of 3.2%, 
adjusted pbita increase of 4.2%, adjusted eps growth 
of 5.9% and a reduction in net debt to adjusted 
ebitda of 2.4x from 2.8x at the end of 2016. further

directors’ remuneration report continued statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interest (audited information)
the executive directors are required to build up a minimum shareholding in g4s, as explained in the remuneration 
policy.in relation to mr almanza, the value of the termination 
payment would cover the balance of any salary and 
associated benefits payments due to be paid for the 
remaining notice period, the value of which will be 
determined by the remuneration committee.we value the 
feedback from our biennial global and management 
surveys and take time in between to address the issues 
raised.we have audited the financial statements, included 
within the integrated report and accounts (the “annual 
report”), which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of financial position at  
31 december 2017; 
• the parent company statement of financial position  
at 31 december 2017; 
• the consolidated income statement for the year  
then ended;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; 
• the parent company statement of changes in equity 
for the year then ended; and 
• the notes to the financial statements, which include  
a description of the significant accounting policies.we assessed the mathematical accuracy of management’s cash flow model and 
agreed the underlying forecasts to board approved budgets and assessed how 
these budgets were compiled.given that the operation and formalisation of mfc controls are at different 
levels of maturity across the organisation, we did not seek to test or rely on 
these controls for our 2017 audit.specific items for the current and prior 
years are described in note 8. 
other separately disclosed items  
in order to provide further clarity in the consolidated income statement, the group also discloses separately certain strategic 
restructuring costs, profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries, acquisition-related amortisation and expenses and  
goodwill impairment.further explanation about the group’s rationale for separately presenting profits or losses on disposal or closure of subsidiaries, 
amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill impairment is set out on page 36. control is achieved where the group has existing rights that give it the current ability 
to direct the activities that affect the group’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity.such financial risk includes the interest-rate risk on the group’s variable-rate borrowings, the 
fair-value risk on the group’s fixed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign-exchange risk on 
transactions, on the translation of the group’s results and on the translation of the group’s net assets measured in foreign currencies.goodwill arising on consolidation represents  
the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent  
liabilities at the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture.revenue for this type of contracts 
is recognised on an accrual basis based on the individual services provided and in accordance with the terms of the contract.where services provided to customers include more than one particular revenue source, particularly in cash technology services and in 
the alarms business, such as the supply and installation of equipment together with on-going services and maintenance contracts, the fair 
value of each revenue source is separately identified and allocated to each element of the arrangement and recognised as the product is 
sold or the services are delivered.this methodology requires the use of a variety of  
assumptions and estimates, including the determination of an appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets,  
mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and inflation.financial report
