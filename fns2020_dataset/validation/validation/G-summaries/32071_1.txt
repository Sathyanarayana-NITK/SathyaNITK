we have made good progress with the installation 
of power generation projects, and will have 6 
operational facilities representing 120mw of capacity 
by the end of 2017. we have the remaining three 
rockpool sites with planning and anticipate having 
these built in time for next winter.from the 
winter of 2020/21, this would reduce the embedded 
benefits received by distribution connected 
generators such as ppg to the residual charge.any loss of triad income is expected to 
be offset by firmer prices in the balancing markets 
as national grid seeks to physically balance the grid 
and the market for flexible power as suppliers seek 
to balance their retail power books and mitigate 
energy price volatility.despite some regulatory question marks, we remain 
confident that our flexgen model is a key part of the 
solution to the challenges ahead as a result of the 
structural changes to the uk’s energy mix.with the government’s commitment to closing all 
coal-fired power stations by 2025, and with new 
gas or nuclear power stations at least 10 to 15 years 
away from coming online, reliance on diverse and 
intermittent sources of energy embedded within 
the distribution network (notably wind and solar) 
is set to increase.the scheduled 
closure of coal power stations, coupled with 
uncertainty and delays in respect of nuclear and gas 
sites, are likely only to exacerbate these issues.embedded generation also generally reduces 
the volume from balancing energy and hence 
can reduce the cost of balancing the system 
on a half hourly basis.we will achieve 90% of our 
goal to reach 200mw of flexible generation by 
the end of 2017 , a significant achievement given 
the fast evolving market in which we operate and 
the evolution of our business model towards gas 
power generation and battery storage.this will give us the opportunity to make an offer for the 
shares we do not own or sell our shares in each site alongside rockpool
–  majority-owned (non-eis)  
gas powered sites
gas
80mw of gas powered sites are at the planning stage, and we have a further 160mw  
in the pipeline.the net proceeds of this will – in conjunction 
with our existing cash resources and asset finance – be used to assist in the development of 
ten 20mw gas powered flexible generation sites.the bond, once fully funded, will enable the 
company to build up to a further ten new majority owned sites, which together with the big six multinational 
utility company, assists in maximising our financing capability and flexibility.during the year under review the group increased its revenue to £1,350,000 (2016: £887 ,500), a rise of 52%, 
from the award of management contracts from the rockpool investee companies.this is the first share option scheme to be implemented since the reverse acquisition of 
plutus energy limited in august 2014. since then, minimal shareholder dilution has been incurred as a result of 
external equity financing as the company has ensured that the ongoing development of the rockpool funded 
portfolio of 180mw of flexgen sites have been financed entirely through external equity and debt thus far.the group 
had cash and cash equivalents of £71,609 and net current liabilities of £89,288 as at 30 april 2017, and 
incurred a loss of £201,501 for the year then ended.so the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.paul also spent eight years at exxon mobil where 
his experience varied from project-managing the design and 
construction of embedded refinery power generation projects 
in the usa and far east, to setting up a gas trading operation in 
the uk and running a risk management team.these options are exercisable for a period of ten 
years from the date of the grant subject to the vesting conditions and the terms of the plan.the life of 
the warrants was extended by one year to 27 august 2017 from the previous expiry date, being 24 months from re-admission of 
the company to aim in august 2014.
