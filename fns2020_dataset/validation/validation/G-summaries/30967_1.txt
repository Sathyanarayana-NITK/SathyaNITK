free education on all aspects of woundcare.we develop the talent at ams by training with programmes such 
as the management development programme and principles of

criteria are met.during 2017 there was a successful transition to a new engagement partner to the group.the group promotes the values of integrity 
and professionalism.as part of the external auditor’s annual review process, any key risks and areas of audit focus are also identified and agreed with the

key principles:

 e total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests;
 e the design of long-term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk; and
 e in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the group and of each individual
