an overview of the scope of our audit 
continued

group audit team at all 2 (2016: 2) of the group’s reporting 
components, all of which are in the uk.5 we have nothing to report on the other 
information in the annual report 
the directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the annual report together with the financial statements.classification of financial instruments issued by the company
financial instruments issued by the company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the company; and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.where the company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, 
an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its 
consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.there are no differences between the accounting policies under 
ifrs compared with frs101; consequently the application of ifrs to the separate financial statements of the company did not give rise to any 
transition adjustments for the comparative financial information.the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.2.4 going concern
