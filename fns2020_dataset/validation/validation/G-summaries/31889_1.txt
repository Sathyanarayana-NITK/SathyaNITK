the notes form part of these financial statements.going concern
the directors estimate that the cash held by the group will be sufficient to support the current level of activities for the foreseeable 
future.deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more 
tax, with the following exception:
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.investments in associates are accounted 
for using the equity method, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change 
in the associate’s net assets with recognition in the profit and loss of the share of the associate’s profit or loss.no standards or interpretations adopted in the year had any material impact on the financial statements of the group.4. employees and directors
