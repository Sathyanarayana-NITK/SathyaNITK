ebitda was £25,000 for the year (2016: £257,000) mainly as a result of 
a slowdown in the uk market and continued investment into the usa, a 
market entered into for the first time last year.over the last year 
the market has become more heavily brokered and fragmented and the 
ability to generate value in traditional digital sectors has been eroded.nakama group plc  | stock code: nak annual report & financial statements 2017

2. accounting policies continued
revenue
revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services provided during the accounting period net of trade 
discounts and value added tax.current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs to 
its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill; and
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit.appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit and loss when there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired, (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay 
in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the 
difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.bank 
overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in the current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.any gain or loss received by the employee share benefit trust on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised directly in equity.where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before 
and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.the temporary 
differences for which the deferred tax asset has not been provided in the financial statements are set out below:

notes to the company financial 
statements
for the year ended 31 march 2017 
1. principal accounting policies
basis of preparation
the parent company financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.the amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement 
of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that 
eventually vest.special business

and as to resolutions 7 and 8 as special resolutions:
