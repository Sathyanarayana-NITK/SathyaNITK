preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.we agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis 
of accounting and we did not identify any material uncertainties.given the growth in the business through acquisitions, we consider that 
these two measures better align with the principal considerations of the shareholders of the group, and are more aligned to practices
