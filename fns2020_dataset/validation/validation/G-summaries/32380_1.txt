the directors’ remuneration policy describes our forward-looking policy and remains the 
same as that which was approved by a binding vote at the company 7 september 2016 annual 
general meeting.it is 
against this uncertainty and the consequential short to medium-term challenges this presents, 
that we have to strike the right balance between retaining key personnel and continuing to align 
them with the longer-term interests of shareholders.awards were 
granted in the form of nil cost options and are subject to continued employment and satisfaction of the performance targets 
described below.allocations are based on an assessment of 
individual performance, with due regard to the achievement of non-financial objectives, the individual’s contribution and behaviour, 
and compliance with the company’s risk appetite.the remuneration policy also complies with relevant financial services regulation, with all incentives subject to remaining within 
the risk appetite of the company.in particular, pre-ipo retention awards were granted to executive directors, senior management and other key employees to 
retain and motivate key talent through listing and beyond.the committee may adjust 
the incentive outcome to 
ensure alignment of pay 
with the underlying 
performance of the 
business over the financial 
year.ltip performance conditions are consistent for 
these employees, while award opportunities may vary by organisational level or business area.the projected value of the long-term 
incentives excludes the impact of share price growth and any potential dividend accrual.the company’s articles of 
association, available on the cmc markets plc group website, detail the appointment and removal process for directors.the process includes collection of resource assumptions required to deliver the group strategy and associated revenue 
impacts with consideration of key risks.t o address the risk associated with the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets we identified key assumptions made by management in 
relation to the future taxable profits to be earned in the australia 
business and the period over which these profits could be 
reasonably foreseen.the 
accounting records for both the uk and overseas businesses 
are primarily maintained and controlled by the uk finance team 
in london.under the listing rules we are required to review the part of 
the corporate governance statement relating to ten further 
provisions of the code.the group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of  
the entity.cmc markets plc became the ultimate holding company of the group under a group reorganisation in 2006. the pooling of 
interests method of accounting was applied to the group reorganisation as it fell outside the scope of ifrs 3: business 
combinations.the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use.the gain or loss 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in operating costs in the income statement.a full provision is made in respect of assets held by the trust as there is an obligation to distribute these assets to 
the beneficiaries of the employee benefit trust.cmc markets plc annual report 2017 financial statements financial statements
