key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
financial statements of the current period and include the
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements is located on the financial reporting
council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.use of our report

difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original
effective interest rate.borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
