flows for the year then ended, and the related notes 
to the consolidated financial statements.bdo is the brand name for the bdo network and for each of the bdo member firms.overall, the group 
expects no significant impact on its balance sheet and equity, except for the effect of applying the impairment 
requirements of ifrs 9. the group plans to defer the application of ifrs 9 until the earlier of the effective date of the 
new insurance contracts standard of 1 january 2021, applying the temporary exemption from applying ifrs 9 as 
introduced by the amendments.non-controlling interests in the results and equity of the controlled entities are shown 
separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of financial position.if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the controlled entity acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.the amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated based upon the gross provisions, having due regard to their 
collectability and the terms of the related reinsurance contract.the reinsurance premiums due are primarily premiums payable 
for reinsurance contracts and are recognised in the profit or loss as outward reinsurance premiums when due.depreciation is calculated 
on the straight line method to reduce their carrying value to the residual amount as follows:
 equipment   5 years
 furniture and fixtures  5–7 years
 leasehold improvements 7 years
the residual values, length of the economic lives and depreciation method applied are reviewed on a regular basis, and 
at least at every reporting date, and adjusted as appropriate.deferred tax is provided in full on all temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities.the charge to the profit or loss represents the amounts payable by the group for the year.the total profit measures are operating profit and profit for the year, both disclosed on the face of the consolidated profit 
or loss.profit commission is recorded at the earlier date of when 
the amounts are received from the reinsurance carriers or when the commission can be reasonably estimated and 
earned by the group.b) estimate of reinsurance recoveries
the group’s reinsurance premiums, loss expense and reserves related to reinsurance business are accounted for on 
a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and terms of the reinsurance contracts.details of the key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amounts are contained in 
note 17.
