the 
majority of bids in the pipeline continue to 
be new business, with rebids representing 
only 30%.the largest 
contributor to this growth was the defence 
and security division which reported 
organic revenue growth at constant 
exchange rates of 15.1%, primarily due to 
the start of the ukmfts fixed wing, rotary 
wing and rear crew contracts and the 
first year of the aviation and engineering 
support and aircraft services (aesas) 
contract.performance
i the group continues to keep under 
review its capital structure to ensure 
that the sources, tenor and availability 
of finance are sufficient to meet its 
stated objectives.internationally, a 
number of submarine programmes are 
in their early concept phases and we 
are actively engaged in developing our 
capabilities to support the design and 
build elements of these programmes.we successfully completed the 
overhaul and reset of 670 vehicles 
returning from military operations ahead 
of schedule and met the demanding 
timelines to issue vehicles for operations 
in central europe from the stored fleet.of particular note was the 
delivery of six 12 tonne stainless steel 
doors to the sellafield site to support 
decommissioning of the pile fuel 
cladding silo, one of the highest hazard 
legacy nuclear facilities in europe.our ability to attract, recruit, retain 
and develop the people we need now 
and in the future is also fundamental 
to that long‑term success.we believe that a culture of respect 
for, and promotion of, human rights is 
embedded throughout our business and 
can be demonstrated by our commitment 
to ethical conduct in everything we do.this 
may reduce the cash available to meet 
the group’s other obligations or business 
needs, and may restrict the future growth 
of the business.if the cost of an operation 
or a contractual commitment is 
denominated or incurred in a currency 
different from the currency of the income 
received from that operation or that is 
being relied on to discharge that 
commitment, movements in exchange 
rates can reduce the profitability of the 
operation and increase the effective cost 
of discharging the commitment.prior to this he was 
chief executive officer of crh 
plc between 2009 and 2013, 
and from 2003 its finance

strategy and awareness of potential 
strategic risks 
in the year the board, in addition to 
the time spent in its regular monthly 
meetings, devoted at least two meetings, 
of which one was a full day meeting held 
off-site, solely to consider the company’s 
strategy.whilst it is 
normal practice for institutional funds to 
have a greater degree of contact with 
the company, all shareholders are 
welcome to raise questions with the 
board at the annual general meeting.to assist our private 
and international shareholders, the investor 
relations team makes sure that all price-
sensitive information is released in 
accordance with the applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.in planning the year-end audit, 
the committee considered with 
management and the company’s 
auditors the key areas of focus for the 
audit having in mind their significance 
to the group’s reporting of results and 
the degree of judgement involved in 
their evaluation.for the year to 31 march 2017, pwc 
has been the group’s external auditors 
having been reappointed by shareholders 
at the agm on 21 july 2016 on the 
recommendation of the board following 
a re-tendering process.malus and clawback apply to psp awards if there is a 
misstatement of the group’s financial results for any period,
if the committee subsequently comes to a view that 
performance was materially worse than originally believed, 
in the event of gross misconduct, or if the award holder 
leaves employment in circumstances in which the award 
did not lapse and facts emerge which, if known at the time, 
would have caused the award to lapse on leaving or caused 
the committee to exercise any discretion differently.the executive directors’ compliance with these guidelines is shown 
in the table on page 126.

job, can we ensure we continue to deliver 
our best for our customers and safeguard 
the future of babcock.in the event of a change of

adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the group

with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the group and the 
company, and enable them to ensure 
that the group’s financial statements 
and the directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the companies 
act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, article 4 of the 
ias regulation.adequacy of information and explanations received
