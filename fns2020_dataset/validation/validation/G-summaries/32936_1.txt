financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017.
review of activities
highland gold mining limited (‘highland gold’ or the ‘company’ or the ‘group’) was incorporated in jersey on 23 may 2002  
for the principal purpose, then and now, of establishing a portfolio of gold mining operations within the russian federation.following consideration of this assessment the audit committee recommended to the board the reappointment of  
ernst & young llp as the company’s auditors.the members of the executive committee, which meets weekly, include management from rdm’s 
functional departments and the general directors of the mine sites.the committee delegates part of its duties to four internal rdm committees: the risk committee; the budget 
committee; the production committee and the investment committee.relations with shareholders
the group’s website provides comprehensive information on the company’s business, results and personnel and is used  
to update shareholders and the market in respect of key developments and announcements (www.highlandgold.com).we focused on this area due to the 
significance of the carrying value of the 
assets being assessed, the number and  
size of recent impairments, the current 
economic environment in the group’s 
operating jurisdictions and because the 
assessment of the recoverable amount  
of the group’s cash generating units 
(“cgus”) involves significant judgements 
about the future results of the business 
and the discount rates applied to future 
cash flow forecasts.highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017

going concern
the directors of the group are required  
to make a rigorous assessment of whether 
the group will remain a going concern  
for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements and assess whether there are 
any material uncertainties in relation to 
the going concern basis of preparation.in the current year the performance of  
the group has improved largely as a result 
of more favourable market conditions; 
therefore we consider that the risk  
has reduced.for the current year, the full scope 
components contributed 100% (2016: 100%) of the group’s ebitda, 100% (2016: 100%) of the group’s revenue and 39% (2016: 
40%) of the group’s total assets.in the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $1.6m to $3.2m  
(2016: $1.1m to $2.2m).highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017

3. summary of significant accounting policies continued 
mine development expenditure
capitalised mine development costs include expenditure incurred to develop new ore bodies, to define future mineralisation in 
existing ore bodies, to expand the capacity of a mine and to maintain production, and also interest and financing costs relating  
to the construction of mineral property.for the purpose of fair value disclosures, the group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.the interest cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the lease period.the group 
determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition (which, in the case of financial assets existing 
at the transition date, includes designation at that date) and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each 
financial year end.where input vat is not recoverable, the vat provision is created on the statement of financial position 
corresponding with the statement of comprehensive income in a relevant period.deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset  
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.in 2017, the group continued testing appropriate 
systems, internal controls, policies and procedures necessary to collect and disclose the required information.management has assessed its cgus as being an individual 
mine, which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are largely independent of those of other assets.in 2016 the gold and silver revenue reported in the gold production segment was received from sales to gazprombank (us$179.5 
million) in the territory of the russian federation.there are no restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital.recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to  
be converted into reserves in existence at the end of the year.notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017

the table below shows the key assumptions used in the fair value calculation at 31 december 2017 and 2016. the triggers for the impairment loss recognition 
were primarily the effect of changes to the mine plan which resulted in lower recovery rate and higher future capital expenditure 
accompanied by higher costs due to a stronger rouble.highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017
