implemented a buy-in transaction, which is a bulk annuity 
purchase that partially reduces member longevity risk while 
improving the investment returns of the pension scheme.realised proﬁts, unrealised proﬁts, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through investment entity 
subsidiaries are aggregated into the single “fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries” line.it meets ahead of the grc 
meetings to consider the key risks impacting the group, 
and any changes in the relevant period where appropriate.finally, we recognise the need to plan and execute a successful 
exit at the optimum time for the portfolio company’s development, 
taking consideration of market conditions.taking the inputs from the strategic planning process, 
the icaap and its stress scenarios, directors reviewed an 
assessment of the potential effects of 3i’s principal risks on 
its current portfolio and forecast investment and realisation 
activity and the consequent impact on 3i’s capital and liquidity.we pride ourselves on the engagement and the sense of 
ownership we have fostered over the years, which has resulted

the nominations committee has a 
vital role to play in ensuring the board has 
the right balance of skills and experience 
to lead the company.during the year, the committee considered a number of 
candidates for appointment as non-executive director and 
recommended to the board the appointment of stephen 
daintith, who was subsequently appointed as a director on 
1 october 2016.
further to the publication of the davies report on women on 
boards, and code provision b.2.4, the board strongly supports 
the principle of boardroom diversity, of which gender is one 
important aspect.this year’s report covered the potential 
impact of a number of tax transparency initiatives that have come 
into force, the current disclosure provided on the group’s website 
as well as the frc’s thematic review on tax disclosures.taking into account the assessment of the group’s stress testing 
results and its risk appetite statement (as disclosed on page 44), 
the committee agreed to recommend the viability statement and 
three-year viability period to the board for approval.area of signiﬁcant attention what the committee reviewed and concluded
valuation of the proprietary capital investment portfolio  
the most material area of judgement in the ﬁnancial statements, and 
noted as a signiﬁcant risk by the external auditor, relates to the 
valuation of the unquoted proprietary capital investment portfolio, 
which at 31 march 2017 was £4,782 million, or 82% of net assets, under 
the investment basis.the committee is satisﬁed that this fee is appropriate.the committee is responsible for keeping the group’s valuation 
policy under review and recommending any changes to the 
policy to the audit and compliance committee and the board.although not an area of valuation judgement, the committee actively 
reviews the results of the back-testing that management prepares on 
assets disposed in each quarter to reconcile the price achieved with the 
carrying value at the last balance sheet date.100% 26.8% 100%
