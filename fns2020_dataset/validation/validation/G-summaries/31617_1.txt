to the calculation of rwas and the delivery of the treasury 
management system.the executive leadership team and board engages at critical 
points of the stress-testing cycle to provide a robust challenge 
in relation to the selection and development of scenarios and, 
thereafter, considers how the results are integrated into future 
strategic decision making, contingency planning, capital and 
business planning and risk appetite.risk appetite

measurement
the group manages capital in accordance with prudential rules 
issued by the pra and fca, which implemented crd iv legislation 
with effect from 1 january 2014. the group’s approach to pillar 1 
is to use the standardised approaches to calculating rwas.as a result of these 
activities, the group may be exposed to forms of market risk that would arise from movements in price on these products.fair value hedges
the group hedges part of its existing interest rate risk, resulting from potential movements in the fair value of fixed rate assets and 
liabilities.third-party risk the risks associated with ensuring the group’s outsourced and offshoring arrangements are 
controlled effectively, including the risk of failure to service existing and new customers, and 
the potential cessation of specific activities, or the risk of personally identifiable information 
or group sensitive data being exposed or exploited, or the risk of financial, reputational and 
regulatory censure if the third party enters into any illegal or unethical activities.we considered the results of the testing 
of key controls operating within the ppi 
and other conduct case handling and 
recording processes which supported the 
data used in the determination of key 
provision assumptions.we communicated to the audit 
committee that the impairment models, 
calculations and assumptions employed 
by the group were reasonable as at 
30 september 2017 and that these 
resulted in impairment provisions that 
were appropriately estimated.a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the financial reporting council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.these are unlikely to result in significant changes to existing measurement bases; however, the final impact will be dependent on 
the circumstances prevailing on 1 october 2018.
impairment overview
the group’s ifrs 9 implementation programme is progressing as planned with models built and an end-to-end parallel run exercise to 
commence during the year beginning 1 october 2017. as expected, there will be a period of refinement required where the series of 
complex decisions, judgements and assumptions made, particularly in relation to the group’s model methodology, that will be reviewed, 
sufficiently tested and benchmarked.the mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the group remains exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards 
of the mortgage loan portfolio, principally the associated credit risk.the securitisation structured entities are consolidated and the 
securitised mortgage loans retained on the group’s balance sheet.cybg plc annual report and accounts 2017 231
