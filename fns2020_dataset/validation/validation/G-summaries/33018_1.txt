azd0865 is a reversible acid pump inhibitor
based on a new concept of acid inhibition
which has the potential to provide faster and
more effective inhibition of gastric acid
secretion than losec.the symbicort phase 3 clinical trial
programme was expanded with several new
studies being started, in preparation for the
scheduled launch of the product in the us
market in 2006.
central nervous system (cns)
sales in cns were driven primarily by the
strong sales growth for seroquel of $927
million (+67%).the rest of europe achieved a strong
performance broadly above expectations
driven by the introduction of nexium and
symbicort in most markets along with the
strong contribution of the oncology portfolio.astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f 2002

research and development (r&d)
clinical medicine to the drug discovery
process.generally , the
responsibility for achieving the required
standards and for the processes adopted in
so doing, resides with the manufacturer .in several european countries, the pricing and
reimbursement systems are being evaluated,
with the aim of controlling and limiting drug
budgets.this was more than
offset by the strong growth of pulmicort
respules in the us (up 75%), enabling
pulmicort to achieve a 5% global sales
increase for the full year to $812 million.rhinocort sales in the us increased by 19%
for the year to $211 million, fuelled chiefly 
by share gains for rhinocort aqua in the
aqueous intranasal steroid market of more
than three percentage points – rhinocort aqua
revenues grew by 39%.this advance payment was calculated as
the then net present value of $2.8 billion
discounted from 2008 to the date of
payment of a rate of 13% per annum and
causes merck to relinquish any rights to
future astra products with no existing or
pending us patents at the time of the
merger.we make ongoing payments to merck based
on sales of certain of our products in the us
(the “contingent payments” on the
“agreement products”) as well as certain
other partnership returns, the latter of which
are not material to the group.the adoption of sfas
no 141 – business combinations and sfas
no 142 – goodwill and other intangible
assets resulted in an increase in us net
income of about $755 million and no impact
on us shareholders’ funds as a result of
impairment.in the rest
of the world, sales were $122 million – by the
end of the year nexium had been launched in
38 countries.throughout 2002, the company has
complied with all of the provisions of the code
of best practice in part 2, section 1 of the
combined code with two exceptions.these
are provision a.2.1 concerning the
appointment of a senior non-executive
director , with which the company has
complied since march 2002, and provision
b.1.7 relating to the notice period of executive
directors’ service contracts.consequently , the company’ s approach to
compliance with the act principally involves
the development and adjustment of the
existing corporate governance framework
and associated processes concerning
reporting, internal controls and other 
relevant matters.chief executive and the senior executive
team
the chief executive, sir t om mckillop, has
delegated authority from, and is responsible
to, the board for directing and promoting the
profitable operation and development of the
company , consistent with the primary aim of
enhancing long term shareholder value.it also usually reviews
those matters which are of a size or
importance to require the attention of, or
which are reserved to, the board before such
matters are submitted to the board for review
and decision.the role of the disclosure
committee is to assist and inform the
decisions of the chief executive concerning
price sensitive information and its disclosure.at the scheduled meeting of the audit
committee held at the end of january 2003,
the chief executive and the chief financial
officer presented to audit committee
members their conclusions following the
evaluation of the effectiveness of the
company’ s disclosure controls and
procedures required by item 15(a) of 
form 20-f .more particularly , it
makes specific proposals in respect of the
remuneration packages of individual
executive directors and the company’ s most
senior executives.astrazeneca has adopted
the disclosure requirements of frs 17.
other accounting policies
foreign currencies
profit and loss accounts in foreign currencies
are translated into us dollars at average rates
for the relevant accounting periods.the company has indicated to the
trustee of the uk fund its intention to target a solvency ratio of 91% following the 2003 actuarial valuation, with a longer term aim of restoring
solvency over a period of around 15 years.exercise of options
an option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has been
satisfied.if neither merck nor astrazeneca exercise the option, the contingent payment arrangements in respect of these
agreement products will continue and the appraised value will not be paid.the exercise price for the second option is the fair value of
these product rights as determined at the time of exercise.in 1998, astra filed suits in the us against andrx pharmaceuticals, inc. and genpharm, inc. this followed the filing of abbreviated new drug
applications by andrx and genpharm with the us food and drug administration (fda) concerning the two companies’ intention to market
generic omeprazole products in the us.astrazeneca denies the allegations and is defending the case.142 requires that goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to 1 july 2001
should continue to be amortised and tested
for impairment until the adoption of the
standard.the cumulative exchange gains and losses (net of tax) on the translation of foreign currency financial statements under us gaap are set out in
the following note:

stock compensation
in the group’ s financial statements prepared under uk gaap , no cost is accrued for the share options awarded to employees under the zeneca
1994 executive share option scheme, the astrazeneca share option plan, and the astrazeneca savings-related share option scheme as the
exercise price is equivalent to the market value at the date of grant.the uk and the us have signed a new
double taxation convention (the ‘new
convention’), which must be ratified by the
uk parliament and the us senate before its
provisions enter into force.in the
pharmaceutical market, a drug, diagnostic or
medical device is normally only subject to
competition from alternative products, in the
same therapy area, during the period of
patent protection or other types of marketing
exclusivity , but once patent protection or
other types of marketing exclusivity has
expired the product is generally open to
competition from generic copy products.the anticipated launch
dates of major new products have a
significant impact on a number of areas of our
business including investment in large clinical
trials, the manufacture of pre-launch stocks of
the products and the timing of anticipated
future revenue streams from commercial
sales of the products.
