industry issues
we believe strongly in both the protection 
of individuals and bodies through an 
effective press complaints mechanism and 
the rights of a free press which is not 
subject to the oversight of a government, 
or government approved, regulator.the industry was forthright 
in its concern over the potential 
introduction of s.40 of the crime and 
courts act 2013 which, if enabled, could 
have operated to make newspaper 
publishers who are not members of a 
statutorily approved body liable for the 
costs of dealing with complaints against 
them – even where those complaints were 
dismissed or shown to have no merit.in february 2018, the 
department for culture, media and sport 
announced a review to preserve the  
future of high quality national and local 
newspapers in the united kingdom.at  
a time when more people are recognising 
the value of trusted and verified news 
sources, we welcome the review and will 
support the nma in its engagement with 
the panel of experts to be appointed to 
conduct the review.the group expects that, subject to the uncertain outcome of the strategic review, the effective tax rate will remain relatively consistent 
with the current and prior year and reflect the reduction of uk corporate tax rates over the next few years.cash generated from operations of £12.2 million is after payment of £1.4 million in professional fees in relation to the disposal of  
the east anglia and east midlands titles (note 16) and pension contributions of £10.3 million.i was appointed as interim chair following the resignation of ian russell, the former chairman,  
at the end of 2016 and my appointment has meant the company has not complied with the code provision that at least half the board 
(excluding the chairman) should consist of independent non-executive directors.we remain committed to the principles of good governance and,  
as a board, seek to regularly review not only the effectiveness of our board and committees but also the wider corporate governance 
framework within which we operate.there were no significant changes to the external commitments 
of the chairman during the year.the company’s 
management accounts break down the results of the group’s operations.accordingly, having taken into account all matters considered by the audit committee and  
the board and brought to its attention during the year, the audit committee and the board and each of the directors considers that  
the annual report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides shareholders with the requisite information  
for evaluating the performance and current strategy of the company.in reviewing its three year plan, the group conducted sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of the combination of a reduction in 
digital advertising growth rates, an additional decline in other revenue streams and shortfalls in cost savings.the committee’s terms of reference permit  
it to oversee the selection process for appointing a new auditor should it determine, or it becomes necessary, to do so.the audit committee chairman also has one or more private meetings with the external audit partner 
during the course of the year to discuss any relevant issues.the committee conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the committee’s performance, including the 
external audit process as part of its work during the year.change of control
under the terms of the senior secured notes due in 2019 issued in may 2014 pursuant to the notes indenture (the ‘bonds’) in the event 
of a change of control of the group holders of the bonds will have the right to require the group to repurchase all or any part of the 
bonds issued.the power will be limited to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value equal to 5% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital as at the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of the notice of annual general meeting.this is in addition to the five percent referred to in 
resolution 12. the directors will have due regard to the statement of principles in relation to any exercise of this power and confirm that 
they intend to use it only in connection with a transaction which they have determined to be an acquisition or offer capital investment 
which is announced contemporaneously with the announcement of the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding six month 
period and is disclosed in the announcements of the issue.not applicable
details of any contract of significance subsisting during the period under review:
(a) to which the listed company, or one of its subsidiary undertakings, is a party and  
in which a director of the listed company is or was materially interested; and
(b) between the listed company, or one of its subsidiary undertakings, and a 
controlling shareholder.these matters 
included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.an impairment of £59.2 million has been recognised against intangibles for the year, and a further 
impairment of £4.4 million has been allocated to other fixed assets as a result of the intangibles  
in the south and northwest cgus now being fully impaired.for further detail, refer to the publishing titles accounting policy in note 3 of the financial 
statements, the critical accounting judgement in note 4, the detail behind the intangible  
assets impairment review in note 13 and the report of the audit committee on page 48.key observations we concur with the level of impairment taken by management and note that the assumptions 
used in the impairment model, including the discount rate and long term decline rates,  
were acceptable.the impact of this in the prior period 
has been to increase the provision against intercompany receivables by £22.4 million, recognise  
a provision against group relief receivable of £18.5 million and increase the provision against 
investments in subsidiaries by £108.9 million.refer to note 21.
the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.these financial statements have been prepared for the 52-week period ended 30 december 2017 (2016: 52-week period ended 
31 december 2016).under ifrs 15 the stand-alone selling price 
of the digital subscription and the print subscription will have to be estimated and the total subscription value allocated between the 
two distinct performance obligations, although ultimately the revenue recognised will be at the same point in time as under ias 18.
although this is unlikely to significantly change the total subscription revenue recognised during the period, the work in assessing this  
is still ongoing.the black-scholes 
calculations are based on a number of assumptions that are set out in note 29 and are amended to take account of estimated levels  
of share vesting and exercise.refer to note 21. the deferred tax credit has largely arisen from £59.2 million of impairment charges on the group’s publishing title 
intangible assets (£10.1 million deferred tax credit) and the disposal of the east anglia and east midlands publishing titles in january 2017 
resulting in a deferred tax credit of £3.2 million.£3.9 million of the current year deferred tax credit has arisen on the group’s bond, due to 
different accounting treatment applied on the bond at the group level in contrast with that applied at the subsidiary entity level due to 
statutory reporting requirements.3 the increase in the amortisation of intangible assets and decrease of depreciation charges in the current year is a result of the transfer of digital intangible 
assets from plant and machinery to intangible assets during the 31 december 2016 period.the revised sharesave scheme was approved at the  
annual general meeting in may 2017. a discount of 20% to the average mid-market price was applied to the issues granted in 2009.  
no discount was applied to the 2010 issue and a discount of 10% was applied to the 2013 issue.notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements continued
