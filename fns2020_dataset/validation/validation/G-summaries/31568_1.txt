customer and sales growth 
the 609 software licence deals secured during the 12 
months ended 31 october 2017 equates to more than 3 
times the number of software licence deals won in the prior 
year.this is an indicator of the level of 
licence business the group would achieve on a monthly basis if 
there was no new business generated in the future and if there 
were 100% renewals.blue prism group plc annual report and accounts 2017
principal risks and uncertainties 
risk description
growth strategies
failing to successfully implement its  
growth strategies
the company intends to carry out certain growth and expansion strategies.the group’s 
growth and future success will be dependent to some extent on the successful completion of 
such growth and expansion strategies currently or proposed to be undertaken by the group 
and the sufficiency of demand for the group’s software.failure by the group to bring about a change in the 
market’s readiness to accept a new technology will lead to slower than projected growth  
in the group’s revenues and profits.the group moreover may not always be able to identify the cause of 
performance problems in its software.the chairman and neds have held meetings throughout the year 
with the various senior managers to improve insight into the 
business operations and the marketplace.the chairman, jason kingdon is not 
independent, however the board considers that jason kingdon’s 
long experience as chairman of the board of blue prism limited 
(which until the ipo was the parent of the group) will be of 
benefit to the board in providing continuity of knowledge and 
additional industry expertise to the group.for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and 
accounts.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the companies act 2006. they are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.the directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing 
integrity of the financial statements contained therein.directors’ responsibilities blue prism group plc annual report and accounts 2017
independent auditor’s report
to the members of blue prism group plc
opinion
we have audited the financial statements of blue prism group plc (the “parent company”) and its subsidiaries (the “group”) for  
the year ended 31 october 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, the company statement of financial position, the company statement of changes in equity, the company statement of cash 
flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.revenue recognition
key audit matter international standards on auditing (uk) (isas (uk)) note that there is a presumed significant 
audit risk arising from inappropriate or incorrect recognition of revenue unless conditions 
exist that permit the rebuttal of that risk.performance materiality levels used for the 2 key components identified within the group were based upon the same benchmarks 
and percentages detailed for the group, due to each component being consistent in both nature, audit risks identified and control 
environment to the group as a whole.• critically reviewing the existence and accuracy of deferred revenue balances shown in  
the statement of financial position at year end to ensure no material misstatements  
were identified.the 2 significant components audited for group reporting purposes accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of the group’s revenue, 86% 
(2016: 65%) of the group’s loss before tax and 59% (2016: 62%) of the group’s total assets and have been subject to a full scope 
audit.matters on which we are required to report by exception
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.consolidated statement of profit or loss

1 accounting policies
basis of preparation
the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.it may be that if blue 
prism’s recognition of licence income 
is accelerated, and this forms the 
bulk of revenues under the standard, 
then the current policy of expensing 
commissions may not require 
substantial amendment.the deferred income is non-
refundable and so the directors are confident that the business has sufficient working capital to satisfy liabilities as they arise.this is recognised up front as opposed to deferring this cost over the period of the contract as 
it is deemed an introductory fee, and is not affected by the future performance of a contract.non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount 
recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.the overall objective of the board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility.during the year the group’s potential exposure to currency risk has increased due to the increased level of business in the us.the maximum exposure to liquidity risk is the trade payables and sales introduction commissions accrued at the year end, these are 
all current and expected to be settled within 90 days of the year end.notes forming part of the

funds repaid to them without interest.if the funds are used to purchase ordinary shares, the purchase may be made at a discount of 15%
