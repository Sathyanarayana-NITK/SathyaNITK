dear shareholder
the board invests a significant amount of time on maintaining high standards of governance, in recognition of the value that sound corporate 
governance can add to the success and sustainability of the group’s business.the company secretary acts as secretary to all the committees  
and each committee has written terms of reference available on the group’s website (www.st-ives.co.uk).the committee considered accounting papers which provided details on the main 
financial reporting judgements and classifications, which were addressed as follows:
significant matters considered how the committee addressed these issues
the assessment of the carrying value
of goodwill (£108.7 million), property, plant  
and equipment (£26.2 million) and intangible  
assets (£42.8 million)
the committee received reports in relation to the assessment of the carrying value of the 
goodwill for each cash generating unit (‘cgu’).the committee is satisfied that there  
are no relationships between the company and deloitte, its employees or its affiliates that may reasonably be thought to impair the auditors’ 
objectivity and independence.payments under the annual bonus plan are subject to:
• compulsory payment of any bonus earned over 50% of salary (on an after tax basis) in the company’s 
shares under the company deferred bonus shares (‘dbs’) arrangement which are subject to a holding 
period of two years; and
• the element of the annual bonus paid in shares is subject to malus provisions in the event of a material 
misstatement of the company’s financial position.page 58 of the annual report on remuneration provides details of the performance measures and 
weightings to apply for the year ended 3 august 2018. eligibility to receive awards is at the discretion of the committee each year.the committee would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards replicate the potential value forfeited/lost in joining 
the company, and in terms of time horizons, vesting periods, expected values and potential impact of performance conditions, these factors are 
recognised in determining the quantum of such compensation.2013 ltip
as reported last year, 2015/2016 adjusted eps performance was below threshold against targets set for 2013 ltip awards and accordingly  
this element lapsed in november 2016. relative tsr performance would have been assessed over the three-year period to 12 november 2016;  
however since the eps underpin applying to this element of the awards was also not met, the full award lapsed in november 2016. accordingly,  
the value of 2013 ltip awards vesting included in the single figure table above for 2016 is £nil.for any shares to vest, the committee must be satisfied 
with the underlying performance of the business.subsequent to the period end,  
the group reduced its term loan by £5.5 million to £24.5 million.this confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the companies act 2006.
political donations
the company made no political donations during the period (2016 – £nil) and the board has no intention to seek shareholders’ approval to permit 
the board to make political donations.under that law the directors are required to prepare  
the group financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards (‘ifrss’) as adopted by the european union and 
article 4 of the ias regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with united kingdom generally 
accepted accounting practice (united kingdom accounting standards and applicable law).conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis  
of accounting contained within note 1 to the financial statements and the directors’ statement on the  
longer-term viability of the group contained within the strategic report.how the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
we challenged management’s assumptions used in their impairment assessment of the group’s goodwill and 
intangible assets.key observations we have not identified any issues or exceptions relating to revenue recognised over our reporting threshold.adjusting items is detailed in the significant accounting policies in note 2 and detailed in note 7, and 
considered within the significant financial matters section of the audit committee report.post-acquisition, the risks relate to the ebitda estimates for the earn-out targets 
and ensuring that the amounts classified as remuneration is correctly distributed over the period in which they 
relate.ifrs 16
the standard will primarily change lease accounting for lessees; lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right 
to use the leased item and a loan obligation for future lease payables.revenue for the level of services 
performed is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome can be measured reliably.the impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in the consolidated income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity reserves.the cumulative expense is reversed when an employee in receipt of the share options terminates service prior to the completion of the vesting 
period.rental costs under operating leases are charged to the consolidated income statement in equal amounts over the terms of the lease.the consideration for each acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed by the group together with the equity 
instruments equivalent to the mid-market share price on the date of completion, in exchange for control of the acquiree.3. revenue
