east performed strongly due to a renewed 
focus on oil & gas maintenance and repair 
business.this, 
combined with very strong growth in 2017, 
may lead to slightly lower organic growth 
rates in the current year.both fulfil our 
three broad acquisition criteria:
 − geographic expansion, typically through 
the acquisition of a distributor in a 
developing market;
 − products that can be integrated into our 
existing businesses; and
 − related acquisitions that fit alongside our 
existing steam specialties and watson-
marlow businesses.during 2017 , we removed 59 machines from the business after a h&s risk 
was identified.we also increased our target for women on the board to 33%, 
as opportunities allow.performance and actions taken in 2017
during 2017 , we established an auditable process to link supply chain 
sustainability to our eco-design and new product development processes 
within the spirax sarco steam specialties business and watson-marlow 
ltd. this means that we will only design new products that contain materials 
available from suppliers that have signed the supplier sustainability code, 
preventing us from specifying materials or substances that do not comply 
with eco-design standards or from using suppliers that cannot meet our 
required standards.in this section of the annual report we set 
out our approach to governance, using 
the five main principles of the corporate 
governance code 2016 (code), and explain 
how the board and its committees are 
structured and their areas of focus during 
the year.key actions during the year
during 2017, we paid particular attention 
to succession planning for the board, as 
part of our on-going response to the key 
recommendations from the last external 
board effectiveness review conducted 
by dr tracy long cbe (the findings 
of the review are set out on page 73).governance report

effectiveness
board evaluation
board evaluation
during 2017, the board carried out an 
internal evaluation of the performance of 
the board and the board committees, 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
code.in accordance with the code an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the board is 
undertaken with input from an independent 
external adviser every three years.during the year the committee received 
reports from external and internal auditors 
on the major findings of their work and the 
progress of management follow-up by way 
of management reports.the committee considered this assurance 
and concluded it was reliable.the committee took 
a number of factors into account when 
evaluating the effectiveness of the external 
audit including:
 − the quality and scope of the planning of 
the audit (in october 2017, deloitte llp 
presented their plan for the 2017 audit to 
the committee); and
 − feedback from all audited operating 
units, the group finance team, senior 
management and directors on the audit 
process and the quality and experience of 
the audit partners engaged in the audit.during 2017, the audit committee and 
board determined that the size of the 
group and the growing function of the 
internal audit warranted the appointment 
of a head of internal audit.however, during 2018 we 
will review our remuneration arrangements to ensure they continue 
to drive incremental performance while appropriately reflecting the 
changes in the size, scope, operations and complexity of the group.furthermore, converting to sterling is misleading due to the large 
movement in exchange rates.kevin boyd:
objectives included fully supporting the due diligence, acquisition and integration of the gestra and chromalox businesses; the successful 
completion of the annual audit cycle; the recruitment of a new group is director and implementation of a revised is strategy with emphasis on 
improvements to cybersecurity; the development of a group tax strategy to improve the group’ s corporate tax position; and implementation 
of the actions recommended in the 2016 internal audit review by pricewaterhousecoopers llp .for these 
reasons, global ip was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for eps growth approved by the board.spirax-sarco engineering plc employee share ownership plan (esop)
executive directors (excluding jay whalen who is a us citizen) are eligible to participate in an hmrc approved share incentive plan known as 
the esop .4
 not subject to performance measures.employee share 
ownership plan 
(esop)
t o offer all eligible uk-
based employees the 
opportunity to build a 
shareholding in a tax-
efficient way.remuneration policy for other employees
the company’ s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of 
experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels.the most senior managers in the business (approximately 80 people 
globally) participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the executive directors.details of shares issued during the year are 
set out in note 21 on page 145.
as at 31st december 2017 the company’ s 
share capital was made up of ordinary 
shares which each carry one vote at general 
meetings of the company.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.(iii) employee share plans 
  incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under 
share option and share award schemes.the stage of completion of the contract is 
determined as follows:
 − installation fees are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the installation, determined as the proportion of the 
total time expected to install that has elapsed at the date of the 
statement of financial position;
 − service fees included in the price of products sold are valued by 
taking a proportion of the sales price (based on the cost of providing 
the servicing) and only recognised in revenue when the service is 
provided; and
 − revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at 
the contractual rates as labour hours are delivered and direct 
expenses incurred.the board believes that this allows users of the accounts to gain a further 
understanding of how the group has performed.
