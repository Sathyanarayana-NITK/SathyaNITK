becoming the global leader in pharmacovigilance by 2020. the 
global pharmacovigilance market is forecast to grow to more than  
$8bn by 2024 from around $3bn in 2015, with contract 
outsourcing forecast to expand from around 30% of the market 
in 2015 to approximately 50% in 2024. the company’s goal is to become the leading global contract 
research organisation for orphan drug development and, 
overall, to continue to outpace the market for clinical 
research services.the percentage of the group’s total revenue 
generated by the top five clients in the year ended 
31 december 2017 was 40% (2016: 51%).however, the 
directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and intend to comply with the corporate governance 
guidelines, to the extent appropriate for a company of its nature and size.in addition, procedures are in place to enable the directors to obtain independent professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties, if necessary, at the company’s expense.peter george is the other member of the audit and

internal control and risk management
the board acknowledges its responsibility for safeguarding the shareholders’ investments and the group’s assets.through the audit and risk committee, the directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the internal controls.the directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between 
the company and its shareholders, especially considering the long term nature of the business.stephen stamp’s salary was increased from £175,000 per annum to £200,000 per annum with effect from 1 july 2016.
bonuses
the timing and amount of bonuses are decided by the remuneration committee with reference to the individual’s performance 
and contribution to the group.the financial statements are required by law and ifrs adopted by the eu to present fairly the financial position of the group 
and the company and the financial performance of the group.how the scope of our 
audit responded to  
the key audit matter
 
we have assessed whether the cgu’s identified are appropriately disaggregated and whether the 
assets included in the impairment model are complete by reconciling the assets to the consolidation 
and considering the disaggregation in line with the requirement of ias 36. we have further evaluated 
the existence and accuracy of the cgu assets by tracing them to supporting evidence.all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted 
for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e.the directors have reviewed a cash flow forecast (the ‘forecast’) for the period ending 
31 december 2019. the forecast represents the directors’ best estimate of the group’s future performance and necessarily 
includes a number of assumptions, including the level of revenues, which are subject to inherent uncertainties.compliance with accounting standards
at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the eu):
ifrs 9 financial instruments
ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers
ifrs 16 leases
ifrs 11 (amendments) accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations
ias 1 (amendments) disclosure initiative
ias 16 and ias 38 (amendments) clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
ias 16 and ias 41 (amendments) agriculture: bearer plants
ias 27 (amendments) equity method in separate financial statements
ifrs 10 and ias 28 (amendments) sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate 
or joint venture
ifrs 10, ifrs 12 and ias 28 (amendments) investment entities: applying the consolidation exemption
annual improvements to ifrss: 2012–2014 cycle amendments to: ifrs 5 non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations, ifrs 7 financial instruments: disclosures, 
ias 19 employee benefits and ias 34 interim financial reporting
the directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the group in future periods, except that ifrs 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial 
instruments.in assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted.financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss comprise of ‘derivative 
financial instruments’.deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.notes to the financial statements continued

financial statements governance strategic report
the results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation 
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
  income and expenses for each income statement are translated on a monthly basis at average exchange rates (unless this 
average is not a reasonable approximation of the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions, in which case income and 
expense items are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions); and
  all resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.the finance element of the rental payment is charged to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
deferred consideration at the date of the acquisition.as permitted by section 408 of the companies act 2006 the income statement and statement of comprehensive income of 
the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.the calculation of the 
recoverable amount requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a 
suitable discount rate in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value.66 ergomed plc annual report and accounts 2017

under ias 12 income taxes, the amount of tax benefit that can be recognised in the income statement is limited by reference 
to the ifrs 2 share-based payment charge.the recoverable amounts of the cgus are determined from value in use calculations.the group prepares cash flow forecasts for the next five years, derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
the board, and forecasts cash flows for the following five years based on a terminal growth rate of 2%, except for the ergomed 
virtuoso sarl cgu and the haemostatix limited cgu, both of the crs segment.under the terms of the acquisitions of pharminvent in november 2016 and psr group bv in october 2017, a proportion of 
deferred consideration is payable in equity.selected directors and employees of the group may be granted options under the long term incentive plan at the discretion 
of the company’s board of directors or a duly authorised committee thereof (the ‘committee’).based on the calculation of the total fair value of the options granted, the company recognised a total charge through the 
income statement of £550,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year ended 31 december 
2017 (2016: £331,000).2017 2016
