clearly, the integration of the lch acquisition has enabled us 
to restructure the cost base of those businesses acquired and 
ensured that profit margins were enhanced.the company continues to have bank borrowings of £3.3 million 
taken out in october 2016 for the purposes of the acquisition 
of lch with repayments being quarterly over the forthcoming 
two years and as such the first repayment was in january 2018.
as with most services businesses, the group had accrued income 
in the form of work performed for clients but not yet billed at 
the year end of £0.9 million (2016: £1.2 million).alan kentish

• liquidity risk
• market risk
• interest rate risk 
• currency risk
these risks are addressed within note 22 of the financial statements
the table below sets out the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group and how they are currently mitigated.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.how the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
we performed a walkthrough of the revenue recognitions 
process and have assessed the design and implementation 
of key controls in process.key observations
based on our work performed, we observed that the 
judgements applied were appropriate and the revenue 
recognition policy is correctly applied.we have focused on the appropriate ageing of billed and 
unbilled balances recorded in the financial accounts and review 
of these aged positions.we consider profit before taxation to be the critical 
benchmark of the performance of the company.we also report to the audit & risk committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.the other information comprises the information included 
in the annual report, other than the financial statements 
and our auditors’ report thereon.a further description of our responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements is located on the 
financial reporting council’s website at: www.frc.org.the estimates, assumptions and key judgement areas which have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the 
carrying value of assets and liabilities are included in the following notes: 
note 3c revenue: a) in the first year of membership the establishment and management fees are recognised 
in full at the time of processing the application; b) from the second year onwards the recognition 
of 50% of the annual fees at the time of invoicing and the deferral of the remainder from pension 
trustee and administration fees
judgement
note 3d accrued income: the recognition of income prior to the submission of an invoice based on the 
estimated amount recoverable for work performed before each year end
estimate
note 3s contingent liabilities judgement
notes 6 & 20 insurance technical reserve: this is calculated based on actuarial assumptions by the insurance 
companies’ appointed independent actuary and involves significant judgements
estimate
note 6 acquisition of subsidiary: fair value of the consideration transferred (contingent consideration) 
and fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition – there is significant 
subjectivity in the determination of the fair value of the asset, if any, that should be recognised 
in relation to any life assurance book purchased as well as the fair value of any client portfolio 
asset recognised and any insurance technical reserves
judgement
note 13 measurement of goodwill: the underlying assumptions used, and other critical judgemental 
considerations including the allocation of cash-generating units, in determining whether goodwill 
has been impaired at each annual impairment review
judgement
note 23 provisions: judgement applied in determining the conditions surrounding the debtors to determine 
whether there is objective evidence of impairment
judgement
e. basis of measurement
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except where investments and other 
financial instruments are held at fair value.the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.non-monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.f. financial instruments
financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the group’s statement of financial position when the group becomes party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.goodwill represents the excess of the 
cost of the acquisition over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree.an impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised.impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between proceeds net of transactions costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method.the performance of the operating 
segments is not measured using costs incurred as the costs of certain segments within the group are predominantly centrally 
controlled and therefore the allocation of these is based on utilisation of arbitrary proportions.the acquisition was highly complementary to stm’s existing business and strategy and contributed to the growth of 
stm.the acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method.the goodwill on acquisition has been remeasured and adjusted to reflect the fair value 
of the contingent consideration.the demographics of 
the group’s client base, including the default risk of the country in which the clients operate, has less of an influence on credit 
risk.liquidity risk (continued)
