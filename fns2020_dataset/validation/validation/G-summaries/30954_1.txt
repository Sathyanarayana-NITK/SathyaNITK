governance
in accordance with the uk corporate governance code, the board 
believes that it has the appropriate balance of skills, expertise, 
independence and knowledge to enable it and its committees to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.internal controls are 
kept under review by the board and its committees and the board is 
committed to maintaining standards of internal controls that are in 
line with industry practice, the group’s needs and regulatory regimes, 
in particular the requirements of the pra and fca.the committee considers and approves 
the internal audit plan annually and looks to ensure its alignment 
with the external audit and the group’s risk management approach.in addition, the committee has 
been responsible for reviewing the group’s own risk and solvency 
assessment and the solvency ii internal model and recommending 
to the board the group’s regulatory and internal control policies and 
procedures and the compliance monitoring plan.to allow for a meaningful comparison, 2016 is 
taken as being 1 january to 31 december 2016, rather than the 18 month financial period.the company’s articles specify that, subject to the authorisation of

assets recognised on acquisition of 
partnership assurance group (“pag”)
intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of pag in 2016, 
including the value of the acquired in-force business are reviewed 
for indicators of impairment and if such indicators exist, are tested 
for impairment.share-based payment transactions
equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date, determined using 
stochastic and scenario-based modelling techniques where appropriate.goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary 
and represents the future economic benefit arising from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.the financial investments measured at fair value are classified into the following three-level hierarchy on the basis of the lowest level of inputs 
that are significant to the fair value measurement of the financial investment concerned:
level 1: quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly (i.e.profits arising from the in–force book of business represent the expected 
return on surplus assets, the expected unwind of prudent reserves above best estimates for mortality, expenses, corporate bond defaults and, 
with respect to lifetime mortgages, no-negative guarantee and early redemptions.adjusted operating profit excludes the impairment and amortisation of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation, and 
restructuring costs, since these items arise outside the normal course of business in the year.for the 
purposes of the disclosure required by schedule 5 to the companies act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the directors in the period 
was £5.7m (2016: £6.7m).the exercise price of the original 
options were also adjusted from £0.94 to £1.13 for the 2014 options and from £1.23 to £1.47 for the 2015 options.the existing goodwill has been allocated to the insurance segment as the cash generating unit.the outcome of the impairment assessment under both scenarios is that the goodwill in respect of the 
insurance operating segment is not impaired and that the value-in-use is higher than the carrying value of goodwill.for asset-backed securities, the assumptions are that the underlying loans supporting the securities are redeemed in the future in a similar 
profile to the existing redemptions on an average rate of 3% per annum, and that default levels on the underlying basis remain at the current 
level of the group’s bond portfolio.these tables have been adjusted to reflect the 
future mortality experience of the policyholders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the underwriting 
process, premium size, gender and the group’s assessment of how this experience will develop in the future.differences between the 
discount rates recognised on new business written during the period and the prevailing discount rates on the entire portfolio of business also 
contribute to the movement in insurance liabilities.in addition to the deposits received from reinsurers recognised within other financial liabilities (see note 25b), certain reinsurance arrangements 
within the group’s subsidiary, placl, give rise to deposits from reinsurers that are not included in the consolidated statement of financial 
position of the group as described below:
• the group has an agreement with two reinsurers whereby financial assets arising from the payment of reinsurance premiums, less the 
repayment of claims, in relation to specific treaties, are legally and physically deposited back with the group.eev represents the sum of shareholders’ net assets and the 
value of in-force business, and is a key measure in assessing the 
future profit streams of the group’s long-term business.
