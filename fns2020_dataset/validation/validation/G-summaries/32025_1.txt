due according to the original terms of the receivables.the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.the principal estimates used in 
valuing these intangible assets are generally based on the future cash flow forecast to be generated by these assets, and the 
selection of appropriate discount rates to apply to the cash flows.notes to the group financial statements continued
