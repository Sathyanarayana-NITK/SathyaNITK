the lincoln well was completed at the end 
of 2016, with results being analysed as the 
rig relocated to halifax to drill the fourth and 
final well in a campaign that lasted 265 days.the ability of the 
project to reach sanction whilst so few 
other developments are doing so illustrates 
the attractiveness of the lancaster field 
and of fractured basement on the rona 
ridge as a whole.therefore, the group purchased the required 
usd at the time of the july capital raise in 
order to match our currency exposures and 
thereby mitigate the foreign currency risk on 
the project.the first of which, occurring in may 2017, 
raised $17 million enabling the group to 
maintain the existing schedule for the eps 
and continue to drive towards fid.the project remains on budget and 
on schedule with first oil, and the related 
cash inflows, expected in h1 2019.
throughout the year, and into early 2018, 
the foreign exchange rate between the 
pound sterling (gbp) and the us dollar 
(usd) has fluctuated significantly.this aims to gain an 
industry wide understanding of the effects of 
drilling on seabed communities, using existing 
industrial technology, observations of the 
seabed, and the recording of the associated 
biological communities.chief financial officer  
age 51. alistair was appointed to 
the board on 16 march 2016 and his 
key responsibilities as cfo are the 
financial and commercial activities  
of the business.the purpose of the lgc includes evaluating 
the merits of a premium listing, and making 
recommendations on the company’s 
organisational structure and processes, for 
changes that will better suit the ongoing 
requirements of a company of hurricane’s 
scale and growth profile.the lgc’s scope includes: evaluation of the 
merits of a potential move to a premium 
listing; recommendations on board size, 
composition and structure including 
governance protocols and the formation of 
additional sub-committees; recommendations 
on any changes to organisational structure, 
and internal processes and procedures; 
recommendations on enhanced reporting and 
disclosure associated with a premium listing; 
assessment of regulatory or other changes 
that may impact on the company’s activities.governance report continued

role of the board 
overall, the board is collectively responsible 
for the long-term success of the company.upon the 
appointment of a new chairman, dr david 
jenkins will step down from being interim 
chairman and will be deemed independent 
under the provisions of the code, reverting 
to his role of senior independent director.election of directors 
in accordance with the articles of 
association, each director appointed by the 
board during the year shall retire at the next 
agm following their appointment and offer 
themselves for election.this information and other significant 
announcements of the group are released 
to the london stock exchange and are also 
made available on the company website.• oversee the relationship with the 
external auditor, including assessing their 
independence and objectivity, and approval 
of auditor remuneration including the level 
of audit and non-audit fees.key matters considered by the 
committee
during the reporting year, and the period 
to date in 2018, the committee has 
discharged its responsibilities and the 
following describes the main aspects of work 
completed by the committee:
annual report and financial 
reporting
the committee has considered the 
significant issues in relation to the 
preparation of the 2016 and 2017 annual 
reports and group financial statements, 
along with the 2017 interim report.the process described has been in 
place for the year under review and up to the 
date of the approval of this annual report and 
financial statements.the focus for the committee towards the 
end of 2017 has been the search for a new 
non-executive chairman to steer hurricane 
forward, assisted by spencer stuart, a leading 
executive search and selection firm.activities during the year 
the committee’s primary focus from late 
2017, upon the resignation of the chairman, 
was to commence a full and rigorous 
selection process of a new independent 
non-executive chairman.the year under review was the first full 
year of performance under the group’s 
new long-term incentive plan, the value 
creation plan (vcp), a one-off five-year 
scheme implemented by the board in 
late 2016, concurrent with the november 
2016 capital raise.the introduction of the vcp was 
accompanied by the introduction of an 
annual bonus cap at 50% of base salary for 
all employees, including executive directors.the executive director’s entitlement to pay in lieu ceases immediately on the date on which the executive 
director accepts an offer of alternative employment or engagement.the first hypothetical scenario assumes 
that the scheme reaches the end of its 
vesting period (in november 2021) with the 
hurdle price of £0.55 per share having been 
achieved for the required period (expiry).the level of reward and variable 
pay that can be achieved by the executive 
directors and certain key senior managers 
is commensurate with their roles and 
responsibilities as this group has the greatest 
potential to influence the milestones of the 
vcp .the metrics chosen aim 
to underpin the company’s operational success in the chosen year and include performance measures in the following key areas: hsse&q; 
operations; subsurface drilling strategy; financial, investor relations; and corporate.we confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.further details of the approach adopted by management in this area are provided in note 3 and 12 of the financial statements 
and in the audit and risk committee chairman’s report on pages 45 to 48.
how the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
our procedures included : 
• participating in meetings with key operational and finance staff to understand the current status and future intentions for 
each asset; 
• assessing whether all assets which remain capitalised are included in future budgets and, if they are not, understanding the 
basis by which management anticipate being able to recover the amounts that have been capitalised; and
• identifying any fields where the group’s licences are at or close to expiry and challenging management’s intention and ability 
to renew any such license.overview
