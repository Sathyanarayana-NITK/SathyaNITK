requirements of the listing rules of the financial conduct authority and describes how the board has applied the principles of good 
governance relating to directors’ remuneration.the remuneration policy is reviewed regularly and the committee is satisfied that the current policy does not encourage undue 
risk taking (e.g.the company’s policy, other 
than in the case of legacy 
arrangements, is to limit pension 
contributions to 20% of salary.where necessary the committee may 
approve the payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment and flexibility is retained for

changes to the board
on 12 january 2017 we welcomed ian burke as executive chairman, replacing david sugden who stood down following seven 
years as chairman of the group.following the appointment of phil maudsley 
as chief executive, ian burke became non-executive chairman (from executive chairman) with effect from 6 april 2017 and his fee 
was set at £150,000 p.a.6. the figures above represent emoluments paid to directors during their tenure in the relevant financial period, with the exception 
of annual bonus payments and long-term incentives, which relate to performance in the period under review but paid/expected 
to vest after the year-end.the personal objectives for the ceo in respect of his period as md, home shopping were partially achieved in that (i) he oversaw 
the granting of full fca permission for express gifts to continue to carry out its consumer credit activities; (ii) limited progress was 
made in delivering the express gifts customer transformation programme and work will continue in this area; (iii) some progress 
was made during the year in the development of a new bad debt model for the business; and (iv) management changes within 
the finance area immediately after the end of the year and the appointment of a deputy md of express gifts during the year were 
important steps towards the management development goals set.as set out in the fy2015/16 report, the award was subject to absolute tsr growth (50% of the award) and eps targets (50% 
of the award).board report on directors’ remuneration i governance

awards will be made under the psp in line with the directors’ remuneration policy.non-executive directors
mr burke became non-executive chairman on 5 april 2017. he will not be eligible for a performance related bonus for fy2017/18.was the accounting 
treatment of the impact of the adoption of the new model appropriate?the table below details these figures at year end:

learning and development is also an important part of our people strategy and express gifts and findel education offer nvq’s and 
role-specific training programmes.inappropriate classification of items as 
individually significant could result in a 
misleading presentation of the trading 
performance of the group for the year, 
or over a period of time.our procedures included: 
—  tests of detail: comparing inventory levels 
to historical sales data to corroborate whether 
slow moving and obsolete inventories have 
been appropriately identified, and challenging 
the group’s categorisation as obsolete or slow 
moving.property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.the granular information provided by the new model has also enabled management to have greater visibility over the impact of 
changes introduced to receivables collection processes by express gifts in recent periods, including the introduction of a strategy to 
pursue the sale of significantly overdue receivables to third-parties.in 
assessing the appropriate treatment of this increase in provision, management has considered whether an adjustment to the level 
of provision recognised at 25 march 2016 and prior should be recognised as a prior period adjustment in accordance with ias 8. as 
the additional provision has arisen from the development of the new model during the year, and is based on information which was 
not available to the group in prior years, management has recognised the increase in the provision in the current year.due to the 
scale of the charge, however, and as the charge does not relate to the current trading period, management has concluded that the 
additional charge should be separately disclosed as an individually significant item in the income statement.the carrying amount of the findel education cgu was determined to be higher than the recoverable amount and consequently an 
impairment loss of £19,800,000 was recognised.the aged analysis of the carrying values of past due debtors which are unimpaired is as follows:
 2017 2016 
 £000 £000
0 – 60 days 1,875 2,026

in determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.during the current period, overdue receivables with a gross value of £25,993,000 (2016: £108,217,000) were sold to third party debt 
collection agencies.the total expense recognised in the income statement of £1,518,000 
(2016: £1,518,000) represents contributions payable at rates specified by the rules of the plan.the results of the ias 19 
valuation are summarised as follows:
 2017 2016 
  £000 £000
fair value of scheme assets 147,349 127,241
present value of funded obligations (152,764) (129,535)
deficit in the scheme (5,415) (2,294)
the weighted average duration of the scheme’s ias 19 liabilities is 18.1 years.the board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks on an annual basis.the carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
are as follows:
