our operations may also  
be affected by political and economic 
instability, including terrorism, civil disorder, 
violent crime, war and social unrest.the likely effect of these changes 
will be to increase the cost for fossil fuels, 
impose levies for emissions and increase 
costs for monitoring and reporting and to 
reduce demand for fossil fuels.3 refer to other reconciliations section for the allocation of the total income tax expense between pre-significant and significant items.it is contextually 
noteworthy, given the earnings 
enhancing controllable inventory 
build, that funds from operations 
significantly exceeded (nearly  
double) the $3,898 million of net 
capital expenditure, $342 million  
of net acquisitions of subsidiaries  
and investments, $561 million  
of acquisitions of non-controlling 
interests in subsidiaries (african 
copper) and payment of $1,175 million 
of dividends to shareholders and 
non-controlling interests.owing to the 
recent timing of the share tender in q4 2017 (glencore now has 63% of the voting 
shares and a 23% overall economic interest), management is in preliminary stages  
of reviewing the operations and the associated reporting framework.we recognise 
the value of multi-stakeholder 
dialogue in addressing these complex 
situations through shared learnings 
and expertise.the company secretary 
attends all meetings of the board 
and its committees.the chairman seeks to 
ensure that the very significant work 
of the committees feeds into, and 
benefits as to feedback from, the full 
board.in addition, 
management in the business receives 
weekly and monthly reports of 
indicators which are the basis of 
regular operational meetings, where 
corrective action is taken if necessary.3. impairment 
the committee considered whether 
the carrying value of goodwill, 
industrial assets, physical trade 
positions and material loans and 
advances may be impaired as a result 
of commodity price volatility and 
some asset specific factors.firstly, prior 
to the notice of 2017 agm being 
compiled, the committee considered 
the performance of each director.summary of directors’ remuneration policy
general policy for executive directors
to facilitate the attraction, retention and motivation  
of executive directors and other senior executives of 
appropriately high calibre to implement the group’s 
strategy.the powers of the directors are set out in the articles and 
provide that the board may exercise all the powers of the 
company including to borrow money.these matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.independent auditor’s report

description of key audit matter how the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
the group is exposed to credit and performance risk arising  
from the group’s global production and marketing operations, 
particularly in markets demonstrating significant price volatility 
with limited liquidity and terminal markets.we challenged management on the disclosures in the  
financial statements in relation to taxation, specifically on the 
requirement for adequate assessment of uncertainties and 
contingent liabilities.independent auditor’s report

glencore annual report 2017 our application of materiality
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.we also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.the other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.see note 24 for a summary of the acquisitions of subsidiaries completed during the year and the  
key judgements made in determining control thereof.classification and measurement
ifrs 9 modifies the classification and measurement of certain classes of financial assets and liabilities and will require the group 
to reassess classification of financial assets from four to three primary categories (amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss,  
fair value through other comprehensive income), reflecting the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow 
characteristics.historical cost is defined as the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value 
of the consideration given to acquire them at the time of their acquisition.total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the company and  
to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.deferred taxes are recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable income, using enacted 
or substantively enacted income tax rates which are expected to be effective at the time of reversal of the underlying temporary 
difference.the amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation, including interpretation of specific 
laws and likelihood of settlement.summarised profit and loss in respect of glencore’s associates and joint ventures, reflecting 100% of the underlying associates’  
and joint ventures’ relevant figures for the year ended 31 december 2016, including group adjustments relating to alignment  
of accounting policies or fair value adjustments, is set out below.the carrying value of trade receivables approximates fair value.notes to the financial statements
