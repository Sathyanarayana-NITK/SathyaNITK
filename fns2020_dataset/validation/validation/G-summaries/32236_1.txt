notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
1. accounting policies
sysgroup plc (the ‘company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the united kingdom.basis of preparation
the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.sysgroup plc  annual report & accounts 2017 54
in the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially 
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.the fair value hierarchy has 
the following levels:
a. quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
b. inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.sysgroup plc  annual report & accounts 2017 56
share based payments
the fair value of employee options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a 
corresponding increase in equity.the fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.in this situation, the expenditure is capitalised and amortised expense is included in 
administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the years during which the group 
is to benefit.the significant intangibles recognised by the group, their estimated useful economic lives and the methods used to 
determine the cost of intangibles acquired in business combinations are as follows:
intangible asset customer relationships
estimated uel 5-7 years
valuation method estimated discounted cash flow sysgroup plc  annual report & accounts 2017 57
deferred taxation
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated 
statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of 
the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.2. significant accounting estimates and judgements
the preparation of this financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the period end date and the amounts reported for revenues and 
expenses during each period.this involves 
judgement regarding the future development of the business and the estimation of the level of future profitability and cash 
flows to support the carrying value of goodwill.sysgroup plc  annual report & accounts 2017 58
valuation of intangibles acquired in business combinations
determining the fair value of customer relationships acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value 
of the cash flows related to those relationships and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.there have been no substantive changes in the group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods.the group’s policy is to prepare periodic working capital forecasts, allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of 
the group and company, to manage liquidity risk.4. segmental analysis
the chief operating decision maker for the group is the board of directors.the accounting 
policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.sysgroup plc  annual report & accounts 2017 62

no individual customer accounts for more than 10% of the group’s revenue.during the year to 31 march 2017 the group incurred £414,000 of costs in relation to this acquisition.the recoverable amount is determined based on a discounted cash flow basis and is allocated to individual cash 
generating units.the carrying value of each cgu is as follows:
