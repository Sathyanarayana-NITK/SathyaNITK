a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the company (a situational conflict).responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report
we confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the strategic report and directors’ report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.the group audit team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back.the financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the company’s functional currency.these forecasts, which include detailed cash flow projections, comprise assumptions as to sales and profit performance by 
segment and by month, and take account of the normal seasonality profile of the business.leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for 
as goodwill.the group is reviewing the standard in more detail to ensure it prepares itself for inception and expects that ifrs 16 will have a material 
impact on the group’s consolidated results and associated impact on both assets and liabilities.no deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates based on the current 
repatriation policy of the group and the fact that, given the current tax regimes in the countries in which the group operates, no withholding 
or other tax should arise should the group choose to remit the earnings of those subsidiaries, or should associates choose to remit their 
earnings.the ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date was as follows:

the carrying values of the company’s assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.the values applied to the key 
assumptions are derived from a combination of external and internal factors based on past experience together with management’s future 
expectations about business performance.
