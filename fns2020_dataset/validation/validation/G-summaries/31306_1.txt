as a consequence 
of their common ultimate control, the company and smart 
energy are deemed to be related parties under the aim rules 
for companies, and more details of this arrangement are set 
out in the announcement made on 30 june 2017, as well as in 
notes 4 and 31 below.nevertheless, and despite some 
recent improvements, the ukrainian banking sector remains 
weakly capitalised and so the risks associated with the 
banks in ukraine remain significant, including in relation to 
the banks with which the group operates bank accounts.in addition, the group performs a review of its oil and gas 
assets for impairment on an annual basis, and considers 
whether an assessment of its oil and gas assets by a suitably 
qualified independent assessor is appropriate or required.currency
since the beginning of 2014, the ukrainian hryvnia has 
significantly devalued against major world currencies, 
including the us dollar, where it has fallen from 
uah8.3/$1.00 on 1 january 2014 to uah28.1/$1.00 on 
31 december 2017, although it was relatively stable during 
2017. this devaluation was a significant contributor to the 
imposition of the banking restrictions by the national bank 
of ukraine over recent years.in addition, these 
licences carry ongoing compliance obligations, which if not 
met, may lead to the loss of a licence.the chief executive officer and two of the non-
executive directors are nominees of energees management 
limited, the majority shareholder of the company.communication with shareholders
the board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders 
for the performance and activities of the company and the 
group.capital structure

movements in the company’s issued share capital during the 
year, are shown in note 25. the company has one class of 
ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income.the directors are not 
aware of any agreements between holders of the company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.day-to-day management of the operations of the group, including accounting and financial reporting, is undertaken in kiev, 
ukraine.rationale for benchmark 
applied

assessing the performance of the group, 
and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, isas (uk) require us also to

2. accounting policies continued
going concern
based on the positive operational and financial performance of the group and for the reasons outlined in the principal risks 
and uncertainties section of the strategic report, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future regarded as at least 12 months after the date of signing 
of these financial statements.accordingly, the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing its consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 december 2017. the use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration the company’s 
and the group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the principal risks and 
uncertainties section of the strategic report.gains and losses on disposals of development/producing assets are determined by 
comparing proceeds from sale with the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset and are recognised in the 
income statement for the year.costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the 
net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs necessary to bring the reserves into 
production.interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount.the early pension benefit (in the form of a monthly 
annuity) is payable by employers only until the employee has reached the statutory retirement age.deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised.deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset 
(a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of 
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.the carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.for the 
purpose of the company’s financial statements, these receivable balances are impaired if the present value of estimated future 
cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the original effective interest rate is less 
than the asset’s carrying amount, and the resulting impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss in the company’s financial 
statements.the full extent to which the provision is required 
depends on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the costs and timing of any decommissioning works and the 
discount rate applied to such costs.the change in estimate during 2017 reflects a combination of a revision in the estimated costs (increase of $559,000) and the 
discount rate applied (increase of $421,000).a further amount of $6,000,000 is expected to be settled by the end of 2018. as 
such, a foreign exchange difference of $351,000 accumulated on the intra-group balance of $14,560,000 since the date of 
de-designation of this balance as part of the company’s net investment in the foreign operation up to 31 december 2017 was 
recognised in profit or loss in these consolidated financial statements.notes

the parent company, regal petroleum plc, holds direct interests in 100% of the share capital of regal petroleum (jersey) 
limited and regal group services limited, with all other companies owned indirectly by the parent company.the forecast profits are based on the current field development plan at the mex-gol and sv gas 
and condensate fields, and are determined using data from the same cash flow model which was used for impairment review of 
such development and production asset, as outlined in note 15. based on these projections, the deferred tax asset recognised 
will be recovered by 2022. however, should future field development not result in additional production, only $1 million of the $7 
million deferred tax recognised would be recoverable based on forecast profits available from the group’s existing wells.the group holds currencies to match the currencies of future capital and operational 
expenditure.the significant devaluation of the ukrainian hryvnia has resulted in the national bank of ukraine, among other measures, 
imposing comprehensive restrictions on the processing of client payments by banks, on the purchase of foreign currency on 
the inter-bank market and on the remittance of funds outside ukraine.furthermore, as a result of recommendations from the international monetary fund, significant reforms to the ukrainian 
banking sector are being implemented, which are intended to strengthen the capitalisation of the ukrainian banks.
