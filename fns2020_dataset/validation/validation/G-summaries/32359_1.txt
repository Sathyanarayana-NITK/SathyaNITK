paul abberley was appointed 
to the board and became chief 
executive officer following 
regulatory approval in december 
2014. from april 2016, paul also 
took over the oversight of the 
financial planning and charles 
stanley direct divisions.in october 2016, gary joined the 
board of the chartered institute 
of securities & investment as 
a trustee.sir david howard  
bt.leadership
the board of the parent company, charles stanley group 
plc, has provided leadership to and is responsible for the 
long-term success of the group.matters delegated to the csc board include:
• setting csc business strategy
• approving csc’s financial budget performance against 
the agreed risk appetite
• regulatory oversight and managing the relationship with 
the fca
• setting desired customer and conduct outcomes 
• appointment of the cro.during late 2016 and early 2017, with support from external 
consultants, the group underwent a review of its governance 
framework; this included an evaluation of the performance 
of the boards, committees and the directors.the board has established a risk committee to consider the 
nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives, which is closely supported 
by the cro and reports to the board.led by the senior independent director, david pusinelli, 
the non-executive directors also met without the chairman 
present to discuss the evaluation of his performance, 
having taken into consideration separate consultation 
with the chief executive officer.the effectiveness of the 
chairman was confirmed and feedback on the appraisal 
was given to the chairman.consequent to the default by csfs of its loan repayment 
obligations, an impairment charge of £0.5 million, 
representing the full carrying value of the capital and 
interest due, has been recognised in the income statement 
in 2017. agreement in principle has been reached to 
reschedule the loan repayment and a review will be 
undertaken at each future reporting date to assess 
the recoverability of this loan.• although, as notified in the 2016 annual report and accounts, 
anthony scott stepped down from the board on 18 april 2016, 
he was a director at the start of this financial year and 
hence he has been included and accounted for in this report.annual bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures 
are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to support 
the group’s strategic goals.to reflect the group’s strategic objective 
of driving growth and improved quality 
of profits, the core annual bonus plan is 
structured as a ‘profit pool’ under which 
an agreed percentage of adjusted profit 
before tax (pbt) can be distributed to the 
executive directors, with a portion of this 
distribution based on performance against 
individual targets.adjusted pbt is defined as pbt adding back 
bonus pool accrual, the financial services 
compensation scheme (fscs) or similar levy 
and, in exceptional circumstances, any other 
items the committee consider appropriate 
to reflect the underlying financial 
performance of the group.during the period until vesting of awards, the numbers 
of shares awarded are increased by the value of 
dividends notionally payable in respect of the 
vesting shares.50% of this bonus pool was allocated across all the executive directors on an equal basis, with the remaining 50% of 
the bonus pool being allocated to each executive director based upon their performance against pre-set individual 
performance objectives.further information regarding these targets are specified in the ‘implementation of policy’ 
part of the table on page 67.
the resulting bonus awards are paul abberley £180,000, ben money-coutts £120,000, gary teper £120,000 and 
michael lilwall £35,000.paul abberley 19,698 20,333 no

the notes on pages 105 to 145 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.the principal activities of the group are set out in the directors’ report.the directors also considered the regulatory capital of the group and determined that, 
based on the latest approved forecasts, the group will have sufficient regulatory capital for the same 18-month period.the present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of aa credit-rated corporate bonds that have terms 
of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying 
amount of the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.charles stanley annual report and accounts 2017 110
