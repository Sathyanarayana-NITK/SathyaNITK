oncology and other pending 
clinical programmes
an area of increasing interest in the 
microbiome field, and one 4d has long 
focussed on, is oncology.as recently 
announced, 4d has highlighted key aspects 
of the mode of action of mrx0518, identifying 
a specific component of the bacteria that 
stimulates pathways known to be associated 
with the body’s response to cancer; these 
findings are to be investigated further in 
upcoming clinical trials.performance
4d mines its discovery platform microrx 
to identify live biotherapeutics that show 
therapeutic effect, with defined functional 
mechanisms of action applicable to target 
indications.performance
in 2016 4d established its own 
development and manufacturing facility 
in león, spain, via the acquisition of the 
production assets of instituto biomar, s.a. 
since then, 4d has taken it to a gmp-certified 
facility, enabling the development scale-up 
for its candidate strains and increasing 
clinical/production capacity to up to 
100 million capsules per annum.performance
4d has built up its intellectual property 
estate, the largest in the microbiome space 
in terms of coverage and geographical 
scope, to help secure and consolidate 
its leading position in the field.r&d spend

£16.9m +66%
financial allocation of resources
the split of overheads between research 
and development (“r&d”) and other costs, 
whilst not necessarily highlighting the 
qualitative aspects of that spend, does 
enable us to ensure that we are directing 
sufficient operating funds towards the 
advancement of our technology.the key objectives for this process are to ensure that the risk 
appetite of the board is embedded throughout the group and fully 
understood by all members of the team who have responsibility 
for managing the risk and making key business decisions.although 4d reports its results in sterling, a significant 
proportion of our operations trade in local currency 
and as such the group has a large exposure to 
the euro and to a lesser extent the us dollar.the implementation 
of board decisions and day-to-day 
operations of the group are delegated 
to executive directors.corporate governance statement
