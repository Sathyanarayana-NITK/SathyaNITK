launching the integration was our top 
priority in 2017 and by the end of that  
first year we achieved annualised  
run-rate savings of £52m per year.as part of the transaction, we welcomed 55 
brokers to our institutional services division.we remain committed to delivering £100m 
of synergy savings over the duration of the 
integration programme.the purchase of the policy represents a bulk annuity ‘buy-in’ and has 
been accounted for in accordance with the requirements of ias 19 ‘employee benefits’ .the assessment has been made taking into account the following:
 > the current liquidity position of the group including its base case and stressed case cash flow forecasts;
 > the liquidity stress testing and reverse stress testing undertaken by the group;
 > the icaaps undertaken by the group’s fca regulated entities;
 > the assessment of the group’s principal risks, including those that would threaten the group’s business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity.in arriving at this conclusion, the directors have made the following assumptions:
 > the group maintains access to liquidity through the group’s £250m revolving credit facility (note 23 on page 132);
 > the group reduces its excess goodwill in accordance with the terms agreed with the fca in the group’s waiver from consolidated capital 
adequacy requirements under crd iv;
 > the group does not lose its waiver from consolidated capital adequacy requirements under crd iv due to changes in the regulatory rules;
 > the group successfully refinances the £80m notes that mature in june 2019 (note 23 on page 132);
 > the group achieves the successful integration of the icap business and delivery of the expected synergies; and
 > the group takes appropriate action to mitigate potential adverse effects arising from brexit.www.tpicap.com

106 financial statements 1. general information 
tp icap plc (formerly t ullett prebon plc) is a company incorporated in 
england and wales under the companies act.2. basis of preparation
(a) basis of accounting
the group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(‘ifrss’) adopted by the european union and comply with article 4  
of the eu ias regulation.any differences between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity  
and attributed to the owners of the company.the group currently expects to adopt 
the standard for the year ending 31 december 2019. 
ifrs 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of 
whether an asset is controlled by the customer.revenue for the service of 
matching buyers and sellers of financial instruments is stated 
net of sales taxes, rebates and discounts and is recognised in 
full on trade date; 
(ii) matched principal brokerage revenue, being the net proceeds 
from a commitment to simultaneously buy and sell financial 
instruments with counterparties, is recognised on trade date;
(iii) executing broker brokerage, where the group executes 
transactions on certain regulated exchanges and then ‘gives-up’ 
the trade to the relevant client, or its clearing member.intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.the resulting gain or 
loss is recognised immediately unless the derivative is designated 
and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing  
of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the  
hedge relationship.non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
that are measured at historical cost or fair value are translated  
at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or at the date  
the fair value was determined.as the actual purchase price of the policy was 
higher than the accounting value of the policy, a reduction in the 
scheme’s assets was recorded.the group makes 
estimates to determine the acquisition date fair values of the 
intangible assets that arise on consolidation and to estimate the 
useful lives of these assets.such settlement ‘fails’ give rise to a funding requirement, reflecting the value of the security which the group  
has ‘failed to deliver’ until such time as the delivery leg is finally settled and the business has received the associated cash.the group is also exposed to potential margin calls from clearing houses and correspondent clearers, in both the uk and the united states.£7m of costs attributable to the issue of 
the ordinary shares have been expensed directly to equity.it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cftc investigation or to provide an estimate of any potential financial 
impact.
