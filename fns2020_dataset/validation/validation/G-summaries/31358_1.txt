it has offices in the us, germany and australia.the division is effectively a start-up business 
within the group and is expected to be loss 
making in 2018, although we do anticipate that 
it will have a direct and positive impact on the 
performance of our dillistone systems business 
starting in 2018. during 2017, gatedtalent 
incurred an operating loss of £0.439m and 
development expenditure of £0.391m was 
capitalised.as the business grows there 
may be insufficient support to ensure that the growth is 
effectively managed and integrated.acquisition related administrative costs totalled 
£0.823m (2016: £0.331m) and were in respect 
of the amortisation of intangibles arising on 
the voyager, fcp and isv acquisitions and

the notes on pages 35 to 60 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.the principal activities have been detailed in the strategic report and the registered office is 50 leman st, london, e1 8hq.valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied.valuation of share-based payments
the estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for 
the valuation model chosen.the group has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options granted, leaver rates and 
the time of exercise of those options.the group uses the ‘live’ date as the 
basis of determining the timing of customer practical acceptance, thereby reducing the judgement required to ascertain the timing of licence revenue 
recognition.where revenue is invoiced in advance for such services, the amount in advance is 
included in deferred revenue and released over the period to which the service relates.the cash awards are based on a capped cash bonus with performance conditions related to the 
growth in earnings per share of the group.the data used 
for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future 
reorganisations and asset enhancements.where the individual fair values of the complementary assets are reliably measurable, the group recognises them as a 
single asset provided the individual assets have similar useful lives.depreciation on these assets is provided at rates estimated to write off 
the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:
leasehold land and buildings the lower of 5 years or the remaining lease period
office and computer equipment 3–5 years straight line
fixtures, fittings and equipment 4–5 years straight line
1.14 financial assets
the group classifies its financial assets under the definitions provided in international accounting standard 39 (ias 39) financial instruments: 
recognition and measurement, depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.the remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in the 
‘convertible loan note reserve’ within shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.1.24 defined contribution pension scheme
the pension costs charged in profit or loss represent the contributions payable by the group during the year.revenue is currently recognised over the life of the subscription, which is unchanged under ifrs 15;
• outright licences – the customer pays a one-off amount to purchase a licence conferring a perpetual right to use a version of the software.key management of the group are the directors and the divisional directors of dillistone systems and voyager software.further details of the contingent consideration are given in note 24.

• 30% of net revenues in the nine month period to 30 september 2017 less £25,000 (calculated at £146,000).the group aims to manage foreign exchange risk at a local level by matching the currency in which revenue is generated and expenses are incurred.
