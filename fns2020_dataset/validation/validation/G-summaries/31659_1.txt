key audit matters (continued) 
 
revenue recognition 
revenues for the year increased significantly compared to the previous year totalling £3.03m for the year ended 30 
september 2017 (2016: £1.44m).in this area our audit procedures included: 
• we performed cut off procedures by testing items from revenue recognised during the year and subsequent to 
year end to gain assurance over the completeness of revenue recognised in the year.carrying value of intangible assets 
the group’s intangible assets in respect of capitalised development costs and expenditure on platform software 
development represent the most significant asset on its statement of financial position, totalling £1,210,071 as at 30 
september 2017. management and the directors are required to ensure that only costs which meet the ifrs criteria 
of an asset and accord with the group’s accounting policy are capitalised.given the significance of the assets on the 
group’s statement of financial position and the significant management judgement involved in the determination of 
the capitalisation of costs and the assessment of the carrying values of the assets there is an increased risk of material 
misstatement.we determined the materiality for the group financial statements as a whole to be £45,000, calculated with reference 
to a benchmark of turnover, of which it represents 1.5%.lightwaverf plc

an overview of the scope of our audit 
we considered the risk of the financial statements being misstated or not prepared in accordance with the underlying 
legislation or standards.matters on which we are required to report by exception 
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ 
report.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.the company controls an investee if 
all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the 
investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.reverse acquisition accounting was determined to be required in accounting for the business combination of the 
company and lightwaverf technology limited because following the business combination; the parent company is 
effectively controlled by the board and the former shareholders of lightwaverf technology limited.the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.lightwaverf plc

ix)  taxation (continued) 
 
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period in which the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the statement of financial position date.the fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.lightwaverf plc
