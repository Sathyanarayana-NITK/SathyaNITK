destiny pharma had a major breakthrough in 2003 when 
its innovative research created a new anti-bacterial drug 
platform, the xf drugs.since signing the deal in 
december 2017 the parties have held a meeting at cms headquarters 
in shenzhen, china and have commenced discussions through the 
steering committee on potential projects that can be progressed 
under the agreement.for 
example, the agreement with cms is 
a broad collaboration to develop the 
company’s assets in the china/asia 
market.the recent us study shows the 
potential of xf-73:
• appropriate clinical safety profile;
• well tolerated at multiple doses;
• no drug exposure in the 
bloodstream;
• rapid, anti-staphylococcal action 
in the nose; and
• antibacterial efficacy statistically 
demonstrated over placebo.in 2016, the who published its global 
guidelines for the prevention of 
surgical site infection, which now 
too recommend the screening and 
decolonisation of all staphylococcus 
aureus strains pre-surgery in high 
risk surgeries.there are approximately 40 million 
surgeries per year in the us alone, all 
of which expose patients to the risk of 
post-surgical infections.following the ipo and the completion 
of our cms collaboration agreement, 
the outlook for destiny pharma is 
strong and our team is committed 
to delivering our strategy and 
building value.destiny pharma may not be able to enter into 
partnering relationships for the commercialisation 
of its drug pipeline assets.risks and uncertainties
