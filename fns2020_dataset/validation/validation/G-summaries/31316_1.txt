security capabilities and capacity, and the ability 
to develop new applications and technologies 
to the ongoing benefit of our customers.a large part of the group’s growth 
strategy is geared around the exchange and 
delivery of these meter assets.loss of required accreditations
the installation and maintenance of electricity and gas 
meters within the uk is a regulated activity and, as 
such, the organisations need to maintain the required 
industry accreditations which are reviewed on an 
annual basis.the outcome of any 
report or incident investigation is 
summarised and provided to the 
audit committee for its review.nevertheless, in considering its own arrangements for governance, the company has regard, so far as is 
practicable and appropriate for a company of its size and nature, to the provisions of the uk corporate governance code, 
and to the recommendations of the quoted companies alliance (qca).at each meeting the board received reports from:
 x the ceo on health and safety, strategic, operational 
and business developments, and investor relations;
 x the cfo on the financial performance of the business, 
budget, funding and capital; and
 x each of the board committees on matters discussed 
at their meetings.directors are provided in advance with a formal 
agenda of matters to be discussed at each meeting and with 
the detailed information needed to monitor the progress of 
the company.audit committee

graeme bissett (chair), miriam greenwood and 
willie macdiarmid.x reviewing the effectiveness of the group’s systems 
for internal financial control, financial reporting and

evolution of the group’s risk management and 
internal audit procedures.the committee is aware that the 
board receives a report on termination 
recoverability and provisioning each 
month and has assessed the group’s 
processes for calculating and regularly 
monitoring termination income 
recoverability.kelly will chair a newly 
created information and technology committee of the 
board, reviewing and providing strategic guidance on 
development of the company’s technology programmes.remuneration of executive directors is structured to 
ensure that:
 x the fixed element of pay, salary, pension and benefits 
is benchmarked against comparable companies of similar 
size and complexity;
 x a substantial proportion of executive directors and 
senior management remuneration is linked to the group’s 
performance; and
 x remuneration rewards specific kpis which deliver, inter 
alia, long‑ term value to shareholders, a safe operating 
environment, compliance will relevant health and safety 
policies and outstanding service to customers.a contribution of up to 
5% per annum of salary 
is paid into the scheme,

overview of our audit approach
key audit matters x recoverability of termination income and the impact on traditional domestic meter assets residual values.basis of consolidation
the consolidated accounts of the group include the assets, liabilities and results of the company and subsidiary undertakings 
in which smart metering systems plc has a controlling interest.specifically, the group controls an investee if, and only if, the group has all of the following: power over the investee 
(i.e.revenue is recognised on 
a straight line basis over the lease term.exceptional items and separately disclosed items
the group presents as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income those material 
items of income and expense which, because of the nature or expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit 
separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in that year, so as 
to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.if any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).f

impairment continued
where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cgu) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cgu) in prior years.financial statements

accounting policies continued
financial statements
group as lessor
leases in which the group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of assets are classified 
as operating leases with meter income recognised in line with the meter rental income policy.standards and interpretations
these new accounting standards and amendments are applicable to the group for the first time in 2017. however, they do not 
impact the annual consolidated financial statements of the group.under ifrs 16, a lease liability will 
have to be recognised on the balance sheet for each and they will be depreciated over the period of the lease.financial statements
