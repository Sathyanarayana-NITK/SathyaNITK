the board has identified those risks which are deemed 
principal to its business due to their potential severity 
and link to the group’s strategy, markets and operations.cga delivers a wide range of support and activities 
for its tenants and works with a number of partners 
to meet the diverse range of needs faced by the 
community.during the year, we have assessed our level of 
compliance with the code and the board confirms that 
throughout the year the company has continued to 
comply with all of the code’s provisions, in so far as 
they apply to a ftse smallcap company.further information 
about these processes and procedures and how their 
effectiveness has been assessed are reported in the 
audit committee report on page 45.
the board considers that the group operates 
a risk‑aware culture which facilitates the early 
identification of problems and issues, so that 
appropriate action is taken in a timely and proactive 
way to minimise the impact on the business.the executive directors continue to pro‑actively engage 
with both existing and potential shareholders with the 
purpose of understanding their appetite to invest in the 
company.the committee receives regular reporting from 
management and the conclusion continues to 
be that a generally robust and effective control 
environment exists.recognition and 
measurement of 
customer rebate 
agreements and internal 
stock provisions
the committee examined the procedures and controls in place to ensure the reporting, monitoring and 
accounting for both customer rebate and internal stock provision elements of the group’s accounting 
policies was effectively managed and recognised in the group’s financial statements.performance measures • a bonus of 80% of salary is based against a sliding scale of challenging and stretching financial 
performance targets, of which the first 50% of salary is payable in cash and the remaining 30% of salary

purpose and link  
to strategy
• to ensure the group is able to attract and retain experienced and skilled non‑executive directors able to 
advise and assist with establishing and monitoring the strategic objectives of the company.the maximum bonus opportunity 
for the executive directors continues to be 100% 
of salary: 80% of the award will be subject to a 
sliding scale of challenging operating profit targets 
and 20% will be subject to specific measurable 
personal targets.awards subject to the 
eps condition will lapse unless the company’s eps 
compound annual growth rate (cagr) (adjusted 
to exclude the effects of amortisation of intangible 
assets and exceptional items) is at least 8%, at which 
level 20% of this element will vest.the eps performance measure has been selected 
as it is one of the kpis used in the business 
and is a measure well understood by the senior 
executives.(4) the annual bonus is the cash value of the bonus in respect of the year ended 30 june 2017, including any deferred shares which must be held for a 
minimum three‑ year period.although their defence costs may be met, neither the 
company’s indemnity nor the insurance policy provides 
cover in the event that the director is proved to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.(ca06)
in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in this 
information.(ca06)
responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
responsibilities of the directors for the  
financial statements
as explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 66, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.the period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is 6 years, covering the years 
ended 30 june 2012 to 30 june 2017.
other matter
we have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of mcbride plc for the year ended 
30 june 2017 and on the information in the directors’ 
remuneration report that is described as having 
been audited.critical accounting judgements and estimates
(i) background
in applying the group’s accounting policies, the directors 
are required to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses.the directors consider the following to be the key 
accounting judgements and estimates made in preparing 
these financial statements that, if not borne out in practice, 
may affect the group’s results during the next financial year.at 30 june 2017, the carrying amount of long-lived assets 
was £21.7 million (2016: £20.0m).any non-controlling interest in the acquired business is 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of the business.when goodwill is tested for impairment and 
the carrying amount of the cgu or group of cgus to 
which it is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
impairment is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of the goodwill and then to the other non-financial assets 
belonging to the cgu or group of cgus pro-rata on the 
basis of their respective carrying amounts.when a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity is immediately transferred to the 
income statement.provisions
a provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount 
and is generally recognised when the group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that a payment will be required to settle the 
obligation and the payment can be estimated reliably.at 30 june 2017, the weighted average interest rate receivable on cash and cash 
equivalents was 0.1% (2016: 0.1%).the closure of this fund was one of the key 
actions in the ‘repair’ phase to limit the growth of fund liabilities, reducing the risks and uncertainty over future cash 
costs associated with providing an active defined benefit pension scheme.the fund is administered and managed by robert mcbride pension fund trustees limited (‘the trustee’), in accordance 
with the terms of a governing trust deed and relevant legislation.independence
we remained independent of the group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the uk, which includes 
the frc’s ethical standard as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.the scope of our audit
as part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements.(ca06)
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the information given in the corporate 
governance statement (page 34 to 66) with respect to 
the parent company’s corporate governance code and 
practices and about its administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies and their committees complies with 
rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the dtr.directors’ remuneration
in our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the companies act 2006.the directors consider these guarantees to 
be insurance arrangements and, therefore, the company 
recognises a liability in respect of such guarantees only in 
the event that it becomes probable that the guarantee will 
be called upon and the company will be required to make a 
payment to the third party.
