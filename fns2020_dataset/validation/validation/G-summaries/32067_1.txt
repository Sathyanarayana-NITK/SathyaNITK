although there has been a small decline, due to 
promotional activity, in the value of consumer sales 
through multiples and discounters, down 1.5% to £1.5 
billion, the discount sector continues to demonstrate 
the most significant growth at over 10% per annum.the risk factors addressed below are those which we believe to be the most material to our business 
model, which could adversely affect the operations, revenue, profit, cash flow or assets of the group and which may prevent us 
from achieving the group’s strategic objectives.• the loss of a major customer and/or being 
too dependent on a small number of high 
value customers could seriously impact 
the sales revenue and hence profitability  
of the business.accrol group holdings plc / annual report and accounts 24
corporate governance statement
peter cheung
executive chairman
the directors place a significant emphasis on ensuring 
that accrol has the appropriate governance structures  
in place.the audit committee 
has the primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal 
controls, ensuring that the financial performance of the group  
is properly measured and reported on, and reviewing reports  
from the group’s auditors relating to the group’s accounting and  
internal controls, in all cases having due regard to the interests of 
shareholders.the directors are kept appraised of developments 
in legal, regulatory and financial matters affecting the group from 
the company secretary, the chief financial officer and the group’s 
external auditors and advisers.internal control
the board are responsible for the group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness, taking guidance from the audit 
committee.the group promotes 
the values of integrity and professionalism.the members of  
the board are available to hear, in confidence, any individual’s 
concerns about improprieties.• the board monitors the activities of the group through the 
management accounts, monthly forecasts and other reports  
on current activities and plans.the company proposes separate resolutions  
for each issue and specifically relating to the reports and financial 
statements.the company ensures all proxy votes are counted and 
indicates the level of proxies on each resolution along with the 
abstentions after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.our directors’ remuneration policy
in the current financial year, the remuneration policy  
has not altered from that described in our previous 
annual report when we undertook a forward-looking 
and thorough review of the underlying policy and 
remuneration structures of companies in the competitive 
marketplace in which we operate.variable pay is both short term and long term;
• align directors’ interests with those of the company; 
• have a pay for performance approach; and
• provide a market competitive level of remuneration to enable the company to attract and retain high-performing individuals, to support 
the ongoing success of the company.the company may, at its discretion, purchase the mip shares for 
cash or by way of the issue of ordinary shares in the company  
as consideration.a good leaver is someone who ceases employment as a result of death, ill health, injury or disability evidenced to the satisfaction of the 
board with remuneration committee consent; retirement at the normal retirement age in accordance with the group’s internal policies; or 
any other reason the board (acting with remuneration committee consent) permits.if the participant’s employment is deemed to have ceased in any of these ‘good leaver’ circumstances, they will be permitted to retain  
their mip shares until the expiry of the normal vesting period.the financial review discusses the group’s financial 
position, along with details of its cash flow and liquidity.the directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group and 
company’s performance, business model and strategy.this includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.the company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 22, which together 
with the company form the accrol group holdings plc group 
(the “group”).going concern
the directors have made appropriate enquiries and formed a 
judgement at the time of approving the financial information that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future.depreciation is 
calculated to write-down the cost of the assets on a straight-line  
or reducing balance basis over the estimated useful lives on the 
following bases:
• leasehold land and buildings   straight line over term  
of lease
• plant and machinery   10% straight line, 
40% residual value
• motor vehicles  30% straight line
• fixtures, fittings and office  25% reducing balance 
equipment
assets under construction are not depreciated, but transferred  
into the appropriate asset class when they are ready for use.the recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.where an impairment loss on 
other assets, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original 
estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount.the group’s loans and receivables comprise 
‘trade and other receivables’ and cash and cash equivalents in the 
balance sheet.accounting for the ipo and, in particular, for the 
transaction fees incurred requires an element of judgement as costs 
determined to be directly related to the ipo are deducted from  
the share premium account.accrol group holdings plc / annual report and accounts 52
