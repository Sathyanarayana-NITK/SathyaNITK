of the consolidated financial statements includes the group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial 
risk and management objectives.based on the above, the directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.regular audit committee meetings are 
also normally attended by the chief executive officer, the chief 
financial officer, the external auditor and the company secretary, 
who acts as secretary to the committee.the auditor is 
permitted to provide non-audit services which are not, and are not 
perceived to be, in conflict with auditor independence, providing 
it has the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work and 
it is the most appropriate adviser to undertake such work in the 
best interests of the group.this approach is considered appropriate and proportionate given 
the size of the business and the extensive work performed by the 
external auditor; however, the need to establish a separate 
independent internal audit function is kept under constant review.the committee reviews accounting papers 
prepared by management which provides details on the main financial 
reporting judgements.the chairman of the board normally chairs the committee

the committee’s main responsibilities are:
 l establishing and maintaining formal and transparent procedures 
for developing policy on executive remuneration and for fixing 
the remuneration packages of individual directors, and 
monitoring and reporting on them;
 l determining the remuneration, including pension arrangements, 
of the executive directors;
 l monitoring and making recommendations in respect of 
remuneration for the tier of senior management one level 
below that of the board;
 l approving annual long-term incentive arrangements together 
with their targets and levels of awards;
 l determining the level of fees for the chairman of the board; and
 l selecting and appointing the external advisers to the committee.the committee plans 
to meet formally at least twice a year and at such other times 
as the board or the committee chairman requires.the committee will continue its policy of setting 
stretching annual bonus targets which take into account several 
internal and external factors and disclose performance against 
targets and associated payouts unless the committee considers 
them to be commercially sensitive.the committee reserves discretion to flex the weighting of annual 
bonus kpis from year to year to ensure that the executive directors 
are incentivised to drive performance through the company’s core 
strategic objectives.the committee believes the performance targets for the annual bonus 
are commercially sensitive in respect of the company and that it 
would be detrimental to the interests of the company to disclose 
them before the start of the financial year.service agreements and letters of appointment
each of the executive directors’ service agreements is for a rolling 
term and may be terminated by the company or the executive director 
by giving not less than six months’ prior written notice.annual bonus plan (audited)
bonuses are earned by reference to the financial year and paid in june following the end of the financial year.the market price of the company’s shares at the end of the financial 
year was £0.915 and the range of market prices during the year was 
between £0.82 and £1.385.company number: 04720018

the notes on pages 58 to 79 form part of these financial statements.the estimated useful life for computer 
software is five years.deferred taxation
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying 
amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of 
financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences 
arising on:
 l the initial recognition of goodwill;
 l the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
 l investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where 
the group can control the timing of the reversal of the difference 
and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.the estimates and assumptions 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below.financial statements
