simon has spent the last 
30 years in the financial 
services profession.the group maintains appropriate insurance cover and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly, in conjunction with the group’s 
insurance brokers.the group’s policy is to remunerate executive directors and senior management through basic salary and benefits, annual 
performance-related discretionary bonuses and participation in long-term incentive plans which promote the creation of sustainable 
shareholder value.fees for the non-executive directors are determined by the board and are reviewed annually, having regard to fees paid to non-executive 
directors in other uk quoted companies, the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.the options will generally be exercisable after approval of the financial statements for the financial year two years after the year of 
grant, or on a change of control (if earlier).3. alan fergusson and mark smith ceased to be directors on 15 august 2017. 
the mid-market closing price of the company’s ordinary shares at 31 may 2017 was 819.5p and the range during the financial year was 
649.0p to 851.5p.accordingly, 
the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements.we note the financial statements include descriptions of significant judgements being made by management and that the accounting 
policies set the basis of accounting for these items.our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.opinions on other matters prescribed by the companies act 2006
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 » the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 » the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.matters on which we are required to report by exception
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and the risks specific to the asset.trade and other payables
trade and other payables are recognised at cost, due to their short term nature.contingent consideration
where the group has entered into an acquisition agreement under which contingent consideration may be payable, management  
reviews the agreement and monitors the financial and other targets to be met to estimate the fair value of any amounts payable.an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment arrangement, 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.details of the cash-generating units  
are contained in note 18. 
the key assumptions used in respect of value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and anticipated changes to revenues 
and costs during the period covered by the calculations, based upon management’s expectation.this requires an estimation of the amount of 
income that will be received subsequent to the reporting date in respect of the accounting period, which is based on the value of historic 
receipts and investments placed by clients under management and advice.the identification 
and the valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired involves estimation and judgement when determining whether the recognition 
criteria are met.transaction costs of £0.1m incurred during the course of the acquisition have been 
expensed and are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and operating cash flows 
in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the period in which they were incurred.mattioli woods plc annual report 2017

acquisition of mc trustees limited continued
synergies include the ability to promote additional services to existing and prospective clients of mc trustees.the group estimates the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration at 31 may 2017 to be £0.9m using cash flows 
approved by the board covering the contingent consideration period and expects the maximum contingent consideration will be payable.despite growth in the number of sipp schemes under administration and further diversification of the group’s wealth 
management and employee benefits revenue streams, the directors believe there is still some seasonality of operations, although  
a substantial element of the group’s revenues are geared to the prevailing economic and market conditions.all employees (see 
note 11) of the group hold contracts of employment in the united kingdom.7. auditor’s remuneration
