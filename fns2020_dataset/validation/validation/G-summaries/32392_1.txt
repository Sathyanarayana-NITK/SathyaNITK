to auditors
the directors who were members of the board at the time of 
approving the directors’ report are listed on pages 20 and 21. 
having made enquiries of fellow directors and of the company’s 
auditors, each of these directors confirms that:
 – to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no 
information (that is, information needed by the group’s auditors 
in connection with preparing their report) of which the group’s 
auditors are unaware; and 
 – each director has taken all the steps a director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish that the group’s auditors are 
aware of that information.in preparing 
the group and company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with ias 8 – accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors 
and then apply them consistently;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in ifrss is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group’s financial position and financial performance;
 – state that the group and company has complied with ifrss, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable.basis of consolidation

current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information are as follows:
carrying value of intangible assets
management judgement is required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets, having reference to future economic benefits 
expected to be derived from use of the asset.further analysis of the estimates and judgements is disclosed in note 8.
deferred tax assets
management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies and having regard to their 
strategic planning processes when making these judgements.the directors have reviewed the requirements of the 
remaining standards and interpretations listed above and they are not expected to have a material impact on the group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application.the infectious disease division specialises in the research, development, production and marketing of kits to aid the diagnosis
