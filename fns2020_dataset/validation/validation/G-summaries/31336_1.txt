people and organisation
keywords is, and always has been, dependent on the quality and commitment of its entire staff to provide and maintain the high levels of 
services expected by the groups’ clients.the maintenance and integrity of the group’s websites is the 
responsibility of the directors.the board of directors
the board of directors have a duty to act in the best interests of their shareholders when determining remuneration.these are explained by the very material rise in the size of 
the business year-on-year.we focused on this area due to the risk of management manipulation of the timing of revenue 
recognition and the cut-off relating to work in progress at the year end.a number of these acquisitions have also included deferred consideration in the form of shares and other cash payments at future dates, which 
add further complexity with regard to the acquisition date fair value of such consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange 
for the acquisitions and business combinations.audit response
we have reviewed the underlying contracts and share purchase agreements to each acquisition to ensure that the basis for treatment of the 
acquisitions is in accordance with the accounting policy and international financial reporting standard 3 – business combinations.the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets is significant 
to our audit due to the fact that the impairment test calculations are based on several key assumptions which are estimated by management, 
and are by nature judgemental.our materiality is higher than the level we set 
for the year ended 31 december 2016 (€0.9m), due to the higher profits of the group.the other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other 
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.when valuing the financial liabilities under the fvtpl model, the group will need to assess any changes in its own credit status, however, this is 
not expected to result in any significant changes to the valuation of such financial liabilities.the main impact 
on the financial statements will be to increase both assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position in relation to leases currently 
considered as operating leases at present value.cash and cash equivalents
for the purpose of presentation in the statement of financial position and on the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash on hand, on call deposits with financial institutions.on disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.the impact 
of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.the fair value of the option is amortised over the 
vesting period, with one-third of the options vesting after two years, one-third after three years, and the balance vest after four years.cash and cash equivalents are necessary for the working capital requirements of the group.both the costs and basis of the claim are subject to audit by the authorities prior to approval and payment of the claim.the chief operating 
decision-maker has been identified as the executive management team made up of the chief executive officer and the finance director.there is no limit to the number of shares which the company can issue.17  share options
