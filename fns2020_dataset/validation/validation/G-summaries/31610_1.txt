reasonable expectation that the group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities

factors such as performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the 
performance period remaining and the form of the award due to be forfeited.the company held

governance financial statements shareholder information strategic report going concern
in accordance with isas (uk) we report as follows:
reporting obligation outcome
we are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.the post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are incorporated in the group’s results using the equity method of accounting.gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in equity to the extent 
that the hedging relationship is effective.the measurement basis adopted represents the best predictor of the resolution 
of the uncertainty which is usually based on the most likely cash outflow.5 million representing 
an adjustment to the net assets sold with wowcher in the dmg media segment and a loss of £4.in addition, the group has no material trading activities or relationships which are critical for euromoney to carry out its business.the consideration received comprised 
a £15.7 million 9.0% loan note.using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £169.9 million (2016 £292.8 million).defined benefit schemes

(sepf), both of which are closed to new entrants and to further accrual.life expectancy risk
the present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme members.the 
benefits for all members of the trust-based plans have been transferred to individual policies held in the member’s own name and the scheme 
is now wound up.share options are exercisable after three years, subject in some cases to the satisfaction of performance conditions, and 
up to 10 years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.it also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the company’s accounting 
policies.
