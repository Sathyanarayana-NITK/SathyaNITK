to be the real estate adviser of choice in our 
markets, and deliver superior financial 
performance, we aim to employ people of 
the highest quality supporting the delivery of 
the highest standards of client service.furthermore, 
the total office take-up in the top six regional 
cities in the uk reached its highest ever level 
in 2017, due to a combination of a natural 
ripple effect outwards from london and the 
south east, and a degree of insulation 
against the potential brexit risk.during the year we continued to build on our 
continental european platform with the 
acquisitions of larry smith in italy and on the 
29 december 2017, the acquisition of aguirre 
newman in spain.in particular, there were stronger 
performances in germany, france, the 
netherlands and spain.as much of the 
group’s revenue is transactional in nature, 
the board’s strategy is to maintain low 
levels of gearing, but retain sufficient credit 
facilities to enable it to meet cash 
requirements during the year and finance 
the majority of business development 
opportunities as they arise.we recognise that the quality of the service we offer is vital to 
maintaining the brand.financial statements governance strategic report overview

obligations to clients could subject the 
group to action and/or claims from clients.we have 
improved the clarity of our reward and 
benefits through the use of a new total

clearly see the full reward package.of these, 184 were senior

nomination & governance committee report
the nomination & governance committee (“committee”) has an important role 
to play in ensuring that the board and its principal committees have the right mix 
of skills, experience and diversity to deliver group strategy and to create value.the committee agreed that, taking 
into account all relevant available information, 
mark ridley, currently chief executive of savills 
uk and europe,was the strongest candidate.reflecting this philosophy, the salaries for the 
executive directors, group executive board 
members and senior fee-earners are set 
significantly below market medians for similar 
businesses, with a greater emphasis on the 
performance-related elements of profit share 
and/or, outside of the uk, commission in the 
total reward package.the group delivered a very strong 
financial performance in 2017 , notwithstanding 
the market uncertainties noted above.full details of the 
annual performance-related profit share 
awards approved by the committee for the 
executive directors are included along with the 
other elements of remuneration in the total 
remuneration table on page 62 of this report.the 
committee is responsible for the broad policy governing senior staff 
pay and remuneration.• salaries in 2018 will therefore be as follows 
• group chief executive officer: £289,000
• deputy group chief executive officer (effective  
1 may 2018): £255,000
• group chief financial officer: £221,000
pension pension benefits are provided through a group 
personal pension plan, as a non-pensionable salary 
supplement or as a contribution to a personal 
pension arrangement.in line with the group’s philosophy that there is 
greater emphasis (than under listed company norms) 
on variable performance-related pay.directors’ remuneration report continued

total remuneration for 2017
set out below are details of executive director remuneration for 2017.
executive directors’ ‘single figure’ for the financial year ended 31 december 2017 and as a comparison for the financial year ended  
31 december 2016 (audited).pension benefits are provided 
either through a group personal 
pension plan, as a non-pensionable 
salary supplement, contribution to a 
personal pension arrangement,  
or equivalent arrangement for 
overseas jurisdictions.the committee may exercise 
its judgement to adjust (on a 
downwards only basis) individual 
annual bonus payouts should 
they not reflect overall business 
performance or individual 
contribution.• audits of the complete financial 
information were performed on the 
businesses in the uk, us, hong kong, 
shanghai (china central), australia and 
south korea, as well as the german 
investment management business.directors’ remuneration
in our opinion, the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
the companies act 2006.use of this report
this report, including the opinions, has 
been prepared for and only for the 
company’s members as a body in 
accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the 
companies act 2006 and for no other 
purpose.other required reporting
companies act 2006 exception 
reporting
under the companies act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit; 
or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; 
or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• the company financial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.the group also refers to revenue and underlying profit on a constant currency basis which are both non-gaap measures.on derecognition of a financial asset in 
its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of consideration received is recognised in profit or loss.tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.the fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.this arises when there is a detailed 
formal plan for the restructuring, identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, principal locations affected and the 
location, function and approximate number of employees to be compensated for terminating their services and when the plan has been 
communicated to those affected by it, raising an expectation that the plan will be carried out.the group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank 
borrowings, at both fixed and floating interest rates.furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
liability recognised in the statement of financial position.as at 31 december 2017 £106.0m (2016: £34.0m) of the 
£300.0m (2016: £250.0m) rcf was drawn.
