furthermore, these results came hot on the 
heels of valirx receiving notification that a 
further method-of-treatment patent has been 
granted by the us patent office covering the 
use of val201 in the treatment of prostate 
cancer.this marked reduction 
in our loss was attributable to a decrease in 
clinical trial expenditure as the manufacturing 
costs for both of the investigational medicinal 
products, val201 and val401, that were incurred 
for their respective trials, were borne during 2016.
in december 2017, we announced the final 
conversion of the cln agreement with yorkville 
– thus resulting in no further obligations existing 
with yorkville.the board sets the overall direction and strategy of the group, 
reviews scientific, operational and financial performance, and advises 
on management appointments.the non-
executive chairman is responsible for overseeing the running of the 
board, ensuring that no individual or group dominates the board’s 
decision-making and ensuring the non-executive directors are properly 
briefed on matters.the specially designed molecule 
mimics natural mechanisms, with one part of the molecule 
identifying and targeting the rebellious gene and the other 
part silencing it.based on these 
results the company obtained mhra and rec 
approval to substantially expand the trial and 
to raise the dosing level in patients, in order to 
accelerate the trials’ ability to reach therapeutic 
levels and to reduce disease progression.not only did the 
company see its two clinical 
compounds make exciting 
strides forward through the 
year, but it also saw those 
advances culminate towards 
the end of the period under 
review.”

complete the pre-clinical package and arrive at 
the optimal formulation so that the company 
obtains the necessary regulatory approvals to 
enter val301 into a clinical trial in 2018.
geneice
our geneice "rebellious gene" editing 
technology has shown continued good progress 
in its late pre-clinical phase.valirx was pleased to report 
commercially viable efficient manufacturing 
capabilities for the compounds and preliminary 
results for the optimised second generation of 
the val101molecule are demonstrating gene 
silencing.furthermore, the trial has also shown indications 
of efficacy and disease stabilisation on imaging 
and a reduction of psa progression, in the 
majority of patients.k j alexander

to the members of valirx plc
opinion
we have audited the financial statements of valirx plc (the ’parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ’group’) for the year ended 31 december 2017 on pages 26 to 54. 
the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and international financial reporting 
standards (’ifrss’) as adopted by the european union.the determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal, requires judgement on the part of management in 
identifying and then estimating the recoverable amount for the relevant cgus.we assessed  
the appropriateness of the methodology applied and tested the mathematical accuracy of the models.we determined the judgement made by the directors that no impairment was required and the disclosures made in the financial statements to be reasonable.we considered the reasonableness of the assumptions within management’s proposed cost reduction actions.how our audit addressed the area of focus.we considered the charge provided in the financial statements of the group and company to be reasonable.responsibilities of directors
as explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as  a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group  
or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.valirx plc annual report and accounts 2017 27

the notes form part of these financial statements.merger reserve
represents the difference between the nominal value of the share capital issued by the company and the fair value of valirx bioinnovations at the date  
of acquisition.the company 
considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents  
for the purposes of the cash flow statement.the tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date.foreign currencies
transactions in currencies other than sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the company, are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions.3 critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.share-based payments
the estimates of share-based payments costs require that management selects an appropriate valuation model and makes decisions on various inputs into 
the model, including the volatility of its own share price, the probable life of the options before exercise, and behavioural consideration of employees.2016
