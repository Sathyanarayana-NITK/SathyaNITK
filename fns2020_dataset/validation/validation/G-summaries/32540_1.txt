based on the most reliable evidence available at the reporting date, including the risks and 
uncertainties associated with the present obligation.borrowing costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, are 
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future 
economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably.management anticipates that all relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the group’s 
accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement.such considerations include the level of support for the avingtrans transaction 
received from the shareholders of the company and the shareholders of avingtrans plc:

a meeting to approve the avingtrans transaction representing 75% or more in nominal 
value of the shares held by those shareholders need to approve it.hayward tyler group plc
