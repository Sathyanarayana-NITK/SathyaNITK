“the breadth of experience of the directors

stewardship of the business.the board has overseen the acquisitions of iforce and speedy freight 
which have broadened our capabilities and expanded the services we 
can offer our customers.as at 6 april 2018, the latest practicable date prior to the approval of this 
document, there had been no change in the interests of directors in the 
shares of the company.on admission the executive directors 
subscribed for a ordinary shares (mip shares) in a subsidiary of the

the company in future at an aggregate value equivalent to a maximum 
of 8% (relevant percentage) of the increase in shareholder value over a

existence, accuracy and 
presentation of revenue 
(£623.9m) 
refer to page 55 
(accounting policy) and 
page 60 (financial 
disclosures).these transactions require 
management to make judgments in order to determine 
the appropriate basis and timing of recognition of 
income deriving from those transactions, and their 
associated presentation within the consolidated income 
statement.however, due to their materiality in the context of the 
parent company financial statements, this is considered 
to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall 
parent company audit.our procedures included: 
• tests of detail: comparing the carrying amount of 
100% of investments and intra-group debtors with 
the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheet to 
identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, 
were in excess of their carrying amount and 
assessing whether those subsidiaries have 
historically been profit-making.the group team instructed component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported.the group team 
performed procedures on the items excluded from group profit before 
tax and exceptional items.8. the purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006. our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose.unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity 
accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the group’s interest in the investee.this documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or 
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are 
recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use
• management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured
other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.in addition, in some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated 
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date.revenue earned from providing property associated services is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement at the fair value of the consideration received/receivable, net of professional fees, associated costs and vat .i. current tax – is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.however, given the 
magnitude of the release and its unusual nature, management determined that the impact of this transaction should be disclosed separately.key sources of estimation in applying the group’s accounting policies
the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.the complexity of the assessment and the 
sensitivity of the assumptions are described in note 25. in the year to 30 november 2017 the group managed its 
operations via distinct functions although it is in the process of moving to managing the business via a sector based view.the gain arising on lease agreement has been added back into underlying profit as it arose as part of the strategy around management of 
the property portfolio, full disclosure is provided in note 5. 
a reconciliation between apms and the statutory ifrs measures is detailed on page 62. the group has been acquisitive during the year, with further one-off non-trading expenses incurred in the investments in iforce group, puro ventures 
(trading as speedy freight), the logistics people and certain assets and liabilities of canute.the acquisition costs of £1.72m include £1.34m in 
relation to contingent consideration accounted for as remuneration.goodwill arising on the acquisition represents the projected profitability of the iforce group, including the assembled workforce, together with further 
potential to exploit synergies between group business units and within the logistics sector as a whole.acquisition of the remaining 50% 
shareholding is expected to result in a higher payment than for the controlling interest due to the rapid projected growth of the business.the business 
was acquired for consideration of £1, subject to the successful novation or buy out of the lease arrangements.the fair value adjustments arose as a result of a revaluation of the property plant, and equipment to market value.the contingent consideration is measurable over the following three 
years and is in place to incentivise management to achieve strong commercial results.customer relationships represent the existing contractual and expected future relationships with customers of the group at the point of acquisition 
and are being amortised over 15 years.financial risks and capital management
through its operations, the group is exposed to the following financial risks:
• funding and liquidity risk
• credit risk from trade receivables 
• interest rate cash flow risk from variable rate bank loans
• foreign exchange risk
in the process of managing these financial risks, the group uses the following financial instruments:
• cash at bank
• bank loans
• trade receivables, including amounts owed by associates and joint ventures
• trade and other payables, including amounts owed to associates and joint ventures
• finance leases and hire purchase agreements
the group’s overall risk management programme focuses on reducing financial risk as far as possible and therefore seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the group’s financial performance.employee claims
the group has various ongoing and potential litigation and claims, principally relating to accidents in the workplace.
