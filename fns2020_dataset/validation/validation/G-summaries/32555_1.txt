board of general healthcare group limited, 
a portfolio company.matters not specifically reserved for the board and its committees under its schedule of matters and the 
committees’ terms of reference, or for shareholders in general meeting, are delegated to members of the executive committee.the individual 
performance of the non-executive directors was also evaluated through one to one interviews with the chairman.shareholders also have the opportunity to meet with the directors following 
the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting.should the merger not complete, the company would then look to re-tender the external audit engagement.an official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and results are summarised for the committee.the committee is responsible for making recommendations to 
the board on the appointment of additional directors and for reviewing the size, structure and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) of the board and the membership of board committees to ensure that they have the 
necessary range of competencies, knowledge and experience required for the direction and oversight of the business.the committee considered a list of potential candidates with the skills, knowledge, 
independence and diversity in its widest sense (gender, nationality, age, experience, ethnicity and background) which would benefit 
the company.the search had resulted in the identification of a female candidate, however due to the pending merger with 
tesco we are not progressing with the appointment.as part of its review, the committee considered the performance and independence of stewart gilliland, helena andreas, 
andrew cripps, gary hughes and karen jones, each of them having confirmed their willingness to stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming agm.the committee’s overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages.accordingly, the committee’s 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward executive directors and executives fairly for 
their contribution.the 
committee has no current intention 
to award more than the policy 
maximum, but if exceptional and 
unforeseen circumstances arise 
that warrant it, the committee has 
discretion to increase this to up to 
400% of salary under the psp rules.the company’s approach to the termination of contracts of service of executive directors is dictated by the relevant 
events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the company.the committee would only exercise the discretions available in the bonus and psp plan rules relating to:
• whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited; and 
• the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.booker group plc annual report & accounts 2017 / governance
