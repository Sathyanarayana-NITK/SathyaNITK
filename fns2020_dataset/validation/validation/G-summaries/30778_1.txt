performance
2017 was the final year of our five-year 
plan to “burst the billion”, aiming to 
grow group revenues to over £1bn by 
2017. group revenues of £957.8m (2016: 
£882.4m), up 9%, leaves us just short 
of this target.this has 
allowed us to maintain strong profitability 
in the work programme during 2017, 
which we expect to continue in 2018.
the apprenticeship levy, introduced 
in april 2017, has created a huge new 
market for apprenticeship delivery.we 
offer a total commitment to all our clients, 
ensuring that all our workers, whether or 
not they are working in areas covered by 
the legislation, are recruited and supplied to 
the standards required by the gangmasters 
and labour abuse authority (“glaa”).these items 
can vary significantly from year to year 
and therefore create volatility in reported 
earnings which does not reflect the 
group’s underlying performance.chris pullen

with total revenue for the year increasing 
by 9% to £957.8m (2016: £882.4m).the board reviews

- strategic 
 and market related

are described here:

shortage of 
staffing resource  
in our recruitment 
division
with uk unemployment rates falling below 
5% and issues around brexit and foreign 
labour, there is a risk that our recruitment 
division will not be able to obtain sufficient 
resource to fulfil its contractual obligations.a gdpr steering committee 
has been set up to review the impact of 
the new regulation, with a programme 
of data security improvements 
due to be rolled out in q1 2018.

that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group 
and company and of the profit or loss of the group and company 
for that period.the directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group and 
company’s performance, business model and strategy.our audit approach
overview
materiality
audit scope
key audit
matters
• overall group materiality: £1,500,000 (2016: £1,500,000), 
based on 4% of underlying profit before taxation.the group has completed a number of acquisitions over the past 
decade, each of which has resulted in the recognition of 
goodwill and intangible assets.within the peopleplus segment there are a number of significant 
contracts which include key performance measures, bonus and/
or penalty clauses.in recognising revenue under these contracts, a number of 
significant estimates are required to be made by management, 
most notably the level of expected bonuses/penalty charges 
which will be settled post-year end, relating to pre-year end 
activities.at each period end, 
management are required to estimate the value of accrued 
revenues.in setting our audit scope, we included any individual subsidiary which contributed more than 15% to revenues or the underlying profit 
before taxation.it is calculated as the sum of a) fair value of consideration 
transferred, b) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing 
equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets.in each case, revenue is only recognised when 
the labour or service has been provided and the group is contractually entitled to the revenue.the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an 
internal discounted cash flow evaluation.in addition, tax losses available to be carried forward, as well as other 
income tax credits to the group, are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.there is an element of judgement included in this 
calculation, with the group taking into account historical experience and future expectations; 
• the group has dilapidation provisions against its leased property estate.on initial recognition, the assets and 
liabilities of the acquired business and the consideration paid for them are included in the consolidated financial statements at their 
fair values.58
