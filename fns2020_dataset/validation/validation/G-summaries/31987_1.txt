annual performance bonus
the 2017 bonus for the executive directors and senior executives was based on: 
 •
revenue targets on sales of genedrive® units and assays
 •
a cash target for 30 june 2017
 •
a trading loss target measured against prior year
 •
progressing the attainment of ce marking for the hcv assay
in each case the absolute targets have not been disclosed, and the directors were awarded bonuses of up to 32.5% of maximum 
potential bonus for the year.due to the loss made in the current year, management has 
performed a full impairment review to compare the carrying 
value of the intangible assets to their recoverable value.the determination of recoverable value was based on value in 
use which required management to make a number of 
judgements and assumptions, of which the following are 
considered to be key:
 •
the period over which the current technology is expected 
to be commercially viable and hence the length of the 
forecast period.•
we challenged the discount rate used by assessing the cost of 
capital for the group and comparing against similar 
organisations.our testing was focused on the key judgements and assumptions as 
follows:
 •
we have compared significant forecast revenue streams to 
supporting information including correspondence confirming 
funding and purchase orders and found these to be consistent.the directors are responsible for the other information.in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify 
any material misstatements in the strategic report and directors’ report.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.use of this report
this report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with chapter 
3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006 and for no other purpose.the genedrive® platform and 
mtb/rif test have been launched in india and a genedrive® hcv test has been successfully assessed by the institut pasteur, paris.•
determining the value of deferred income and expenditure requires an assessment of the duration of the contract to which the 
deferred income and expenditure relates, and informs decisions as to when to recognise revenue and whether to carry forward 
costs.the directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 12 months from the balance sheet date.the financial statements 
therefore represent a continuation of the financial statements of epistem ltd.
revenue
revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes.non-refundable milestone and other payments that are linked to the achievement of significant and substantive technological or 
regulatory hurdles in the research and development process are recognised as revenue upon the achievement of the specified 
milestone.the chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors.the issuance by the company of share options to employees of its subsidiary represents additional capital contributions and the fair 
value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the company’s investment in group undertakings with a 
corresponding increase in total equity shareholders’ funds.as a result of this analysis the carrying value of the intangible assets at 30 june 2017 was reduced to 
£3,038k (2016: £6,273k) and an impairment charge of £2,379k (2016: £nil) was booked during the period.15. deferred revenue
