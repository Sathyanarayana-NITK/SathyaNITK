strategy in action
monetising businesses 
time out is connecting global and local 
brands and businesses with its engaged, 
valuable audience through a variety 
of solutions spanning advertising and 
sponsorship as well as premium profiles 
which allow venues such as restaurants, 
bars and hotels to improve their exposure 
on the platform.mr riley is a member of and chairs each of the group’s audit committee 
and the remuneration committee.the range of curated content sought to reflect the 
best of what was happening in london together with a focus on the issues 
of the day and laid the foundations for the time out brand’s coverage and 
culture today.the company is not required to comply with 
the uk corporate governance code (“the code”) however it intends 
to continue to adopt the principal provisions of the uk corporate 
governance code (“the code”) as appropriate for the size and nature of 
the company and given the composition of the board.directors 
the directors of the company who were in office during the year and 
up to the date of this report, together with their biographical details is 
shown on page 24. 
following the change to her role in early 2017, christine petersen 
resigned as the chairman of the audit committee and remuneration 
committee and matthew riley was appointed in her place.the remuneration committee 
supervises the operation of the ltip and the grant of awards to 
executive directors and the board oversees ltip for employees.in particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain.key audit matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets
refer to notes 12 and 13 
goodwill is an intangible asset that arises on the acquisition of a business 
and reflects the portion of the consideration paid which cannot be allocated 
to separately identifiable acquired assets.we have compared these forecasts to the existing market in 
lisbon and also other information indicating commercial interest in these two 
markets
where there is uncertainty around the outcome of planning and licensing 
applications and appeals we have corresponded with planning advisors and 
external legal counsel to understand the expected outcomes of the cases.25887  11 april 2018 10:34 am  proof 4

ability of the group to continue as a going concern
refer to note 2
for the year ended 31 december 2017 the group made a loss of £26.0 
million and had a cash outflow from operating activities of £21.3 million.we believe that total assets are the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the entity, and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.the principal activities of the group are described in the strategic report that accompanies these financial statements.gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in 
equity.non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the group’s equity and consist of the amount 
of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.property, plant and equipment
the cost of property, plant and equipment includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its 
working condition for its intended use.the excess of the cost 
of acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.only where there is an agreement in place that gives the group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference is the deferred tax liability not recognised.the social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the 
charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.the following standard is not yet effective and has not been adopted by the group: 
ifrs 16, ‘leases’ applies for periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019. it replaces the current leasing standard, ias 17, and requires all 
leases to be treated in a consistent way to the current rules on finance leases, requiring all leases, with limited exceptions, to be disclosed in the 
statement of financial position.25887  11 april 2018 10:34 am  proof4
