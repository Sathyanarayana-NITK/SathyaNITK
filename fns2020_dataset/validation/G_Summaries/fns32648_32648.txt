dividend
given the strong progress made in 2016/17 and ongoing cash generation the board feels it is appropriate to 
propose the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.98 pence per share (2015/16: 3.75 pence) bringing the total for 
the year to 5.89 pence per share, compared with 5.55 pence per share for the year ended 30 january 2016, 
an increase of 6.1%.with new and increased 
operating pressures on the 
dc through multi-channel, 
the reliance and consequent 
exposure to risk of the dc 
failing has increased during 
the year.we ensure that there is the right mix of enquiry and support to the 
executive directors from the non-executives.the board also holds meetings as appropriate, to fulﬁl the ongoing requirements of the 
business during the year.all of the committees have written terms of reference, approved by the board.the 
committee met three times during the year and reported to the board on all matters relating to the 
regulatory and accounting requirements affecting the group, together with the ﬁnancial reporting and 
internal control procedures including the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements.valuation of inventory and related provisions
inventory is a signiﬁcant value on the group’s statement of ﬁnancial position and there is an element of 
judgement relating to the inventory provision.this includes a review of 
progress on the actions agreed in the previous year’s review, a review of the individual contribution of 
non-executives and a review of the chairman.the group will take into account the balance of skills and 
experience on the board, their contribution and level of independence when considering whether to extend 
their appointment beyond the initial term.information and support
all directors have access to the advice of the company secretary, who is responsible to the board for 
ensuring that procedures are followed.salaries for the executive directors are 
determined by the remuneration committee 
taking into account the experience and 
performance of the individual and comparing 
the levels of remuneration with the salaries 
of comparable uk based retailers.differences in pay policy for employees and executive directors
no beneﬁt of the executive director remuneration policy is operated exclusively for executive directors, 
and, as stated in the introduction to this policy report on page 34, the principles applied to the 
remuneration of executive directors are the same as those for the company.in addition, the company can make a payment in lieu of notice equal to base salary that would have been 
paid over the notice period.executive directors may accept one non-executive 
directorship with the prior agreement of the board provided it does not conﬂict with the group’s interests 
and the time commitment does not impact upon the executive director’s performance.long-term incentive plan (ltip)
ltip awards will be made in april 2017 on the same terms as set out in the policy table.the group also maintains a provision in respect 
of dilapidation costs for closed stores and stores 
anticipated to be closed in the near future.proﬁt before tax has been chosen for the basis for materiality as this is 
the measure by which stakeholders and the market assess the wider performance of the entity.we also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we 
identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.an overview of the scope of our audit
our audit work is designed to provide a full audit of the group which consists of moss bros group plc as 
the only trading entity and a number of dormant subsidiaries which are subject to analytical procedures.directors’ remuneration
under the companies act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.the ﬁnancial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases.amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in proﬁt or loss, in the same line of the statement of comprehensive income as the 
recognised hedged item.onerous property lease contracts
the company provides for onerous property lease contracts where the group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease 
obligations exceed the economic beneﬁt until the end of the lease.as a result of the portfolio of stores increasingly 
moving away from the high street and towards shopping centres and retail parks, we reﬁned our estimation technique for calculating 
the dilapidation provision in 2015/16.at the balance sheet date, 
there were no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk.the carrying amount of each ﬁnancial asset represents the maximum credit exposure.the capital structure of the group consists of cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 19.
the group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.as part of this review, the committee 
considers the cost of capital and risks associated with each class of capital.trading transactions
