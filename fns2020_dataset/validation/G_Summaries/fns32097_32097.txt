the above data has been verified by an independent, ucas accredited,  
third party assessor.good governance is a cornerstone of our 
business and the disciplines and practices 
that contribute to this are well understood 
by the northgate team.with the 
appointment of kevin bradshaw in january 2017 a refreshing 
of the group’s strategy was undertaken and this will be a 
further focus of the board throughout fy2018.conflicts of interest 
pursuant to those provisions of the companies act 2006 
relating to conflicts of interest and in accordance with the 
authority contained in the company’s articles of association, 
the board has put in place procedures to deal with the 
notification, authorisation, recording and monitoring of 
directors’ conflicts of interest and these procedures have 
operated effectively throughout the year and to the date of 
signing of this report and accounts.with 
regard to outstanding unvested epsp awards 
the committee has agreed that it will review 
the position at the end of the performance 
period, for each award, when the exact 
impact is known and make any adjustment 
it considers appropriate.the remuneration committee has the discretion to determine the payment of 
dividend equivalents arising over the period between grant and the vesting date.the level of these fees is reviewed every two to three years by the committee 
and ceo for the chairman and by the chairman and executive directors for the 
non-executive directors within the overall limit set by the articles of association 
and with reference to market levels in comparably sized ftse companies, time 
commitment and responsibilities of the non-executive directors.it is proposed that the committee be provided discretion to 
enable that dividend equivalents be paid on dabp and epsp 
awards from date of grant to vesting.there are some 
differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for 
the executive directors and other senior employees, which 
the remuneration committee believes are necessary to 
reflect the different levels of responsibility of employees 
across the company.for the appointment of a new chairman or non-executive 
director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.continued

in summary, the proposed contractual provisions are as follows:
provision detailed terms
notice period current executive directors: six months from the executive and six months from the company.the total fees paid to nbs in respect of its services to the 
committee during the year were £32,708 (2016 – £29,947).9 
this represents the value of matching shares awarded under the 
sip which have fully vested in the year (i.e.2

number of shares (47,597).final year of the

in addition, no awards will vest unless the committee is satisfied that the underlying financial and operational performance of 
the business has been satisfactory.disclosure of information under 
listing rule 9.8.4
dividend waiver arrangements are in  
place for the employee trusts as shown on 
page 71.
length of notice of  
general meetings 
the minimum notice period permitted by the 
companies act 2006 for general meetings 
of listed companies is 21 days, but the act 
provides that companies may reduce this 
period to 14 days (other than for agms) 
provided that two conditions are met.it is the board’s intention that this authority 
would not be used as a matter of routine 
but only when merited by the circumstances 
of the meeting and in the best interests of 
shareholders.by order of the board

report on the financial statements
our opinion
in our opinion:
 | northgate plc’s group financial statements and 
parent company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of 
the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 april 2017 and of the group’s profit and the group’s 
and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then 
ended;
 | the group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (“ifrss”) as adopted by the 
european union;
 | the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted 
by the european union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the companies act 2006; and
 | the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the companies act 
2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
article 4 of the ias regulation.further explanation is included in the group’s critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty in note 3, the audit committee report on page 51 and 
note 14.
we examined management’s assumptions of expected future market values of hire vehicles 
used in the calculation by comparison to external third party industry data for expected 
future market prices.these, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.in addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group, the parent company 
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required to report if 
we have identified any material misstatements in the information referred to above in the 
corporate governance statement.in addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.as a result of 
the clarification of an accounting standard, cash and cash 
equivalents and bank overdrafts are now shown gross, 
even where accounts have a right of offset within the same 
banking facility.any excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recognised as goodwill.northgate plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 april 2017

11 result of the parent company
a profit of £38,138,000 (2016 – £37,624,000) is dealt with in the accounts of the company.in the prior year, the impairment assessment was based on 
risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a three year 
business plan approved by the directors in may 2016 using 
growth rates of 1% over a 10 year period, including terminal 
values, using a discount rate of 8.9% for the uk cgu (which 
included ireland) and 8.9% for the spain cgu.the carrying value of these assets equates to the estimated sale value net of attributable costs to sell.the policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the 
interest cost on outstanding debt.exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in notes 20 and 21.
foreign currency sensitivity analysis
during the year, the group has been exposed to movements in the exchange rate between euro and sterling, where sterling 
is the functional currency of the group.the average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of
