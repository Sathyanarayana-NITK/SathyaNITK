 the loss for the year arises from the group’s continuing operations.the directors have considered their obligation, 
in relation to the assessment of the going concern of the group and each statutory entity within it and have reviewed the current budget 
cash forecasts and assumptions as well as the main risk factors facing the group as set out on pages 19-20.
after due enquiry, the directors consider that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future.otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.the fair value benefit is measured using a binomial valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the jointly 
owned shares were purchased.the results for this entity 
are consolidated within these accounts because the group controls the majority of the voting rights.in 
particular, judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to the 
timing and level of future taxable income.we deem 
this to be the point at which it becomes probable that future economic benefits will be received from the product and hence the criteria for 
capitalisation are met.if we had capitalised other product development costs, then there would have been a reduction of £2,687,000 to the 
loss reported in the income statement

the following accounting standards that are due to be adopted in the next year will or may have an impact on the group’s future financial 
statements:
ifrs 15 – revenue from contracts with customers
the group is required to adopt ifrs 15 from 1 january 2018. ifrs 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, 
how much and when revenue is recognised.ifrs 9 – financial instruments 
the group has assessed the impact of ifrs 9 which uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at 
amortised cost or fair value, replacing many different rules in ifrs 39. the approach in ifrs 9 is based on how an entity manages its 
financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.the group has identified the chief executive officer as the chief operating decision maker as he is responsible 
for the allocation of resources to the operating segments and assessing their performance.interest 
rate risk is managed in accordance with the liquidity requirement of the group, with a minimal amount of its cash surpluses held within 
short-term accounts, which have variable interest rates attributable to them, to ensure that sufficient funds are available to cover the working 
capital requirements of the group.year to
