brewing & brands grew 
revenue 1.7% to £200.3m.taking account of the company’s current position, principal risks and the 
sensitivity analysis discussed above, as well as the potential mitigating actions 
that the company can take, and the experience that the company has in 
adapting the business to change, the board has a reasonable expectation 
that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of assessment.relevant previous experience
kirk davis joined greene king from 
jd wetherspoon plc where he had 
been finance director since 2011. 
he has extensive retail experience 
having held senior finance roles at 
tesco and marks & spencer and is a 
member of the chartered institute 
of management accountants.the board then has the opportunity to 
agree the strategic plans across all areas for the short and medium term.its principal responsibilities are to:
 – approve the group’s long-term objectives, commercial strategy and overall funding strategy;
 – approve the budgets and financial statements, including the report and accounts;
 – approve acquisitions and disposals; and
 – oversee the group’s operations and review performance in light of the group’s strategy, objectives, business plans and budgets.as indicated last year when i took over 
as chairman, the focus of the committee has 
continued to be on succession planning and 
on ensuring that the size, composition and 
structure of the board is appropriate for the 
delivery of the group’s strategic objectives.the committee chose the zygos partnership 
to assist in the recruitment process; the zygos partnership has no other 
connection with the company and has signed up to the voluntary code 
of conduct on matters such as diversity for executive search firms.in addition, the committee 
conducts a review of its own performance on an annual basis and considers 
steps for future improvement taking input from the members of the 
committee, the external auditor and senior members of the finance 
function.financial statements and audit
the committee reviewed and provided input into the audit scope and 
audit plan presented by the external auditor, taking into account the 
comments on the prior year’s annual report by the financial reporting 
council in its review of those accounts.capital versus 
expense accounting
the committee reviewed the group’s fixed asset accounting policy during the year and considered the allocation of costs 
as either capital or expense.following revisions to the policy and the 
introduction of additional controls within the business, the committee was satisfied that the risk of material error identified 
had been appropriately mitigated.in addition to 
the above financial restrictions the audit committee is now required to 
pre-approve all non-audit services, except in limited circumstances relating 
to ad hoc accounting advice, to review any services proposed to be provided 
by the external auditor, to consider whether the skills and expertise of the 
audit firm make it the most suitable supplier of the non-audit services, and 
to ensure that the fees for non-audit services do not exceed 70% of the 
average audit fee over a three-year period.in order to assist the committee with its consideration of the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor, the external auditor undertook an 
annual review of its services provided to the group.under the terms of reference for the 
function, the internal audit team has direct access to the audit committee 
chairman to enable it to raise any significant issues and to maintain independence.reflecting performance against the stretching targets set at the beginning 
of the year, bonus pay-outs for this year were 35.8% of eligible salary for 
the chief executive and 30.3% of eligible salary for the chief financial 
officer.details of measures and 
weightings for the 2016/17 
financial year, and of the 
proposed measures and 
weightings for next year’s 
annual bonus, are set out 
in the annual report on 
remuneration on pages 61 
to 67. an explanation of 
how the performance 
measures were chosen is 
given in the notes below.to 
the extent that the shareholding 
requirement has not been met, 
executives will be expected to 
retain at least 50% of the net 
exercised ltip awards until the 
requirement is met.the company has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims.following the remuneration committee’s assessment of the personal 
target and actual performance, 10% of salary was awarded against this metric.performance measure performance target

payments to former directors
as disclosed in last year’s directors’ remuneration report, matthew fearn stepped down from the board and his role as chief financial officer 
on 29 september 2014. as disclosed last year, he remained an employee of the company until 24 august 2016. 
as set out in last year’s report, the awards granted to matthew fearn under the ltip scheme in 2013 vested on the normal date in october 2016 
subject to performance and time pro-rating.the directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website.we obtained an understanding of the processes for the recognition 
of revenue in each of the revenue streams, and separately for the 
recognition of retrospective discounts (please see below for 
details of their testing).on the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group’s overall control environment, the absence of changes in the business 
environment such as the acquisition of spirit in 2016 and the number and monetary amounts of individual uncorrected misstatements identified in prior 
periods as well as the nature of the misstatements, our judgment was that the overall performance materiality for the group should be 75% (2016: 50%) 
of our planning materiality, namely £10.3m (2016: £6.2m).in addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit.notes to the accounts

significant accounting policies continued
business combinations and goodwill continued
goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business 
combination.ifric 23 – uncertainty over income tax treatments
the iasb issued ifric 23 – uncertainty over income tax treatments in june 2017 to clarify application of recognition and measurement requirements in 
ias 12 income taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, effective 1 january 2019. given the timing of the release the group will assess 
the impact of this standard in the coming period.the net impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth rates used to calculate cash 
flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows:
increased net impairment resulting from:
a 10% reduction in fair 
value less cost of disposal
a 1% increase 
in discount rate
a 1% reduction 
in growth rate

no impairment was recognised in relation to the spirit estate and as such the above sensitivities only include the greene king estate.upon the acquisition of spirit pub company, the swaps were deemed ineffective hedges and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting, with 
movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.– long-term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case of the floating 
rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.rank’s latest appeal was rejected by the supreme court in july 2015 and the group is currently 
awaiting the outcome of related litigation.the company has an employee benefit trust for the granting 
of shares to applicable employees.
