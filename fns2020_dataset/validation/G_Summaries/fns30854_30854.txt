• whilst executive management had improved this area 
significantly over the last five years, there were opportunities to 
improve further in 2017. we report the improvements made in 
2017 in the risk management report (pages 40 to 45).the board 
effectiveness questionnaire posed questions in the following 
areas ranked on a scale of 1 to 3 (with space for comments):
• how well the strategy process works and the board’s 
understanding of the core business and markets
• to what extent board meetings are engaging with high quality 
discussion and open debate and whether all board members 
contribute to discussions and work together well
• whether the skills and experience on the board are 
appropriate
• how the board responds to challenges
• whether the chairman’s leadership style and tone is effective 
and how he works with the chief executive
• whether the company secretary is performing effectively
• whether the board schedule and papers are appropriate
• if the recruitment and induction processes are working well
• whether risk management is undertaken appropriately
• if succession planning is working well
february 2018
a detailed discussion is held by the board on their responses to 
the questionnaire and resulting actions are agreed.the rfp was issued to each of the four participating firms in 
early august 2017. all four firms:
• met with the individuals identified above;
• had access to a data room providing background on the  
group;
• provided written responses to two technical questions set by 
management;
• submitted a formal rfp response to the committee; and
• presented to the group selection committee. attended

chief executive succession
in 2017, after a long career 
at meggitt, stephen young 
expressed his desire to retire but 
committed to continue his role 
until his replacement had been 
identified.his service contract had originally been approved in 2016 when he 
was appointed as chief operating officer, and so was amended primarily to take account of his new role and increase in salary.in deciding salary levels, the committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped to support 
the strategic objectives of the group.further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual report on 
remuneration on page 91.

pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
the charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors and the potential split 
between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘minimum’, ‘on-target’ and ‘maximum’.for this reason, the directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the group and company 
financial statements.other than those disclosed in the audit committee report, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the group or the company in the 
period from 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017.
our audit approach
overview
audit scope
key audit 
matters
materiality
 
• overall group materiality: £17.0m 
(2016: £17.0m), based on 5% of 
underlying profit before tax.where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting 
units so as to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
group financial statements as a whole.amounts recycled from the hedging reserve to the income statement, in respect of cash flow hedge movements, have been recognised in net finance 
costs.revenue from services
revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract.amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the assets.depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
freehold buildings up to 50 years 
leasehold property over period of lease
plant and machinery 3 to 10 years
furnaces up to 20 years
fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years
motor vehicles 4 to 5 years
residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted 
if appropriate.programme participation costs
programme participation costs consist of incentives given to 
original equipment manufacturers in connection with their selection 
of the group’s products for installation onto new aircraft where 
the group has obtained principal supplier status.it represents a reasonable estimate of the expected impact on the 
reported results for the year ended 31 december 2017 and on the net assets at that date but is subject to revision during 2018 as the group 
completes its analysis, particularly for those contracts on which revenue was recognised in the latter part of 2017 under current gaap.the cash inflows of the two advanced composites businesses are not considered independent of one another, and continue to be treated 
as a single cgu.absent a contract, the group also does 
not believe there is generally sufficient certainty over the future economic benefits that will be generated from the technology, to allow 
capitalisation of those costs.the discount rates used are as follows: mabs 10.0% (2016: 9.6%), mcs 10.7% (2016: 10.2%), mpc excluding edac & advanced 
composites 10.1% (2016: 9.9%), edac & advanced composites 10.1% (2016: 10.1%), mss 8.3% (2016: 8.4%) and mts 11.9% 
(2016: 11.3%).the directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from 
these commitments.the net assets of aviation mobility, llc 
which is part of meggitt control systems, are not significant and accordingly the group has not reclassified the assets as held for sale at 
31 december 2017. company statement of changes in equity

property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.in preparing these financial statements, the 
company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure 
requirements of international financial reporting standards 
(‘ifrss’) as adopted by the european union, but has taken the 
following disclosure exemptions permitted by frs 101:
• paragraphs 45(b) and 46-52 of ifrs 2, ‘share-based payment’;
• ifrs 7, ‘financial instruments: disclosures’;
• paragraphs 10(d) and 134-136 of ias 1, ‘presentation of financial 
statements’;
• ias 7, ‘statement of cash flows’;
• paragraph 17 of ias 24, ‘related party disclosures’; and
• the requirements in ias 24, ‘related party disclosures’ to 
disclose related party transactions entered into between two or 
more members of a group.at the date of grant, 
the company estimates the number of awards expected to vest as 
a result of non market-based vesting conditions and the fair value 
of this estimated number of awards is recognised as an expense 
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period 
for which services are provided.
