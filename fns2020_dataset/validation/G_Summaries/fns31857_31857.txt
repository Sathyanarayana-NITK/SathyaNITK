in the number of adverse events 
compared with lower cumulative 
dose regimens and this new dose is 
to be included in the range of doses 
for the g205 dose selection study.the group have

(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.independent auditor’s report to the members

an overview of the scope of our audit
our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded 
on a thorough understanding of the group’s business, 
its environment and risk profile and in particular 
included:
 – evaluation by the group audit team of identified 
components to assess the significance of that 
component and to determine the planned audit 
response based on a measure of materiality.the other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 57, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.it is calculated as the excess of the 
sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred, b) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date 
fair values of identifiable net assets.internally generated intangible assets
an internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or the development phase) of an internal project 
is recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated:
 – the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
 – the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
 – the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
 – how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits
 – the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or 
sell the intangible asset
 – the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development
the amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred 
from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above.when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management.the codm is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the 
operating segments.notes to the financial statements continued allergytherapeutics.com 75

revenue recognition
revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the group for goods 
supplied and services provided, net of statutory rebates paid in germany and excluding value added tax.– the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor 
effective control over the goods sold which is again when the customer has physically received the goods.– it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group, and 
 – the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.arrangements for sales through agents
for all agreements with agents, the agent places orders with the group and goods are then shipped to them.decreases in the 
carrying values arising from revaluations are first offset against increases from earlier revaluations in respect of the 
same assets and are thereafter charged to the consolidated income statement.defined benefit obligations are measured on an actuarial basis using the 
projected unit credit method and are discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability.management have 
identified that the reportable segments are central europe (which includes the following operating segments; 
germany, austria, switzerland and the netherlands), southern europe (italy, spain and portugal), the uk and rest of 
world.the unobservable input relates to the percentage applied for 
this reduction in value.a valuation of the italian land and buildings was carried out in june 2017 by

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and the equity of the group with regard to 
its financial assets and liabilities and the euro to sterling exchange rate.going concern
after making appropriate enquiries, which included a review of the annual budget, considering the cash flow 
requirements for the foreseeable future, noting the renewed overdraft facility, and the effects of sales and foreign 
exchange sensitivities on the group and company’s funding plans, the directors continue to believe that the group 
and company will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and 
accordingly have applied the going concern principle in drawing up the financial statements.if vesting periods or non-market based vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, 
based on the best available estimate of share options expected to vest.
