group.the joint venture and associate profit 
contribution of £26.6m (2016: £31.3m) was £4.7m lower, 
reflecting the end of the northern rail franchise in 
march 2016 and the lower shareholding of awe from 
september 2016. the reduction in underlying trading 
profit also included the impact of other contract 
attrition and in-contract reductions, and the lower 
profitability from new contracts in their initial transition 
and transformation stages.other commentary within the strategic report,

the consolidated financial statements and their accompanying 
notes, should be referred to in order to fully appreciate all the

board evaluation
an external evaluation of the board and its committees 
was due to take place in 2017 however, as stated 
on page 88, the board determined that, due to the 
number of new non-executive directors appointed in 
the latter half of 2017, it would be sensible to allow the 
new directors time to settle into their new roles before 
arranging an external evaluation.all committee 
meetings are held in advance of board meetings, with 
the committee chair updating the board directly on the 
outcomes of each meeting.the committee concluded that the 
new finance operating model was 
appropriate and progress was in line 
with expectations.after taking these reports into 
consideration, the committee concluded that the 
auditor demonstrated appropriate qualifications and 
expertise and remained independent of the company, 
and that the audit process was effective.• people – the committee considers the group’s policies 
relating to its people and matters of relevance to its 
management of people, such as the viewpoint survey 
and the group’s human rights policy.this reduction in maximum earnings opportunity is being 
made against the context of the fourth consecutive year 
of no change to base pay for the ceo or cfo.the approved directors’ remuneration policy as approved at the 2017 agm is displayed on the company’s website,

the current members of the board together with 
biographical details of each director are set out on 
pages 86 and 87.
on 24 may 2017, the company announced that ralph 
crosby, jr would retire as non-executive director of the 
company with effect from 1 july 2017. lynne peacock 
and ian el-mokadem were appointed as non-executive 
directors of the company with effect from 1 july 2017. 
on appointment, lynne peacock became a member of 
the audit, remuneration and nomination committees 
and ian el-mokadem became a member of the group 
risk and corporate responsibility committees.control is achieved when the company:
(i) has the power over the investee; 
(ii) is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
(iii) has the ability to use its power to affect the returns.for the purposes of this review, we consider that to be the period ending 30 june 2019. the directors have also reviewed the principal risks 
considered on pages 20 to 29 of the strategic report and taken account of the results of sensitivity testing.determining whether joint control exists requires a level of judgement, based upon specific facts and circumstances which exist at the year 
end.to the extent that an economic benefit is available as a reduction in future contributions and there is 
a minimum funding requirement required of the group, the economic benefit available as a reduction in contributions is calculated as the 
present value of the estimated future service cost in each year, less the estimated minimum funding contributions required in respect of 
the future accrual and benefits in that year.deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which these items can be utilised.the extent to which actual results differ from estimates made at the reporting date depends on the combined outcome and timing of 
a large number of variables associated with performance across multiple contracts.further information regarding the exceptional items 
arising on discontinued operations in 2016 can be seen in note 4.

goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that there is a risk that it could be impaired.we monitor the results and financial position 
of the issuer on an annual basis to determine whether the risk of default has changed, and therefore whether the assumptions used in the 
valuation remain appropriate.one of these schemes is splas and the other is a non-contract specific section of the rps.
