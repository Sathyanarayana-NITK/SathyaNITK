migration from traditional voice only services to networked it
services contracts and an increase in mobility and broadband
revenue.new wave revenue in this
segment increased by 16% to £544 million driven mainly by the
31% growth in the number of bt business broadband

decline in traditional revenue.external revenue from traditional products increased by 1%

deferred bonus plan awards at 31 march 2006
the following deferred bonuses have been awarded to the directors under the deferred bonus plan.we consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the group ﬁnancial statements.information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented
in the united states generally accepted accounting principles note within
the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (note 35).the group has applied
ifrs 2 ‘share based payment’ retrospectively to all options
granted after 7 november 2002 and not fully vested at
1 january 2005. deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in
respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount
of the group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.the effect of the currency element of currency swaps acting
as hedges against ﬁnancial assets and debt is reported
separately in current and non current derivative ﬁnancial
instruments.under a cash ﬂow hedge the
cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the
transaction occurs.this dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting and therefore the liability
of £632 million (2005: £551 million) has not been included in these ﬁnancial statements.options over 52 million shares (2005: 207 million shares) were excluded from
the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is anti-dilutive.at 31 march 2006 290,047,231 shares (2005: 134,497,000) shares with an aggregate nominal value of £15 million are held as treasury shares
at cost.the weighted average fair value of savings related share options granted during the year ended 31 march 2006 has been
estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model.the interest rate swaps have a remaining term ranging from four to 25 years to match the underlying
hedged cash ﬂows arising on the borrowings consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments.this expense is based on the fair value at the date of grant of the award, using an option
pricing model, and is charged to the income statement over the related performance period.we consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company
ﬁnancial statements.opinion

accounting practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 march 2006;
