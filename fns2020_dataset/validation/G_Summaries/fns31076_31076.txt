in the current environment, and at current 
production rates to which may be added 
additional sales of lpg, management expects 
the group’s financial performance in 2018 
to improve on that of 2017. meanwhile, 
new capital expenditure commitments 
remain within projected cash generation, 
permitting a resumption of a sustainable 
distribution policy for shareholders.besides the implementation of redox-based 
processing at the dobrinskoye gas plant, 
the key operational activities in 2017 were 
construction of the lpg plant and, in the 
separate oil production business, the drilling 
of new horizontal wells on the uzen field.although construction was largely 
accomplished before the end of 2017 
as planned, due to delays in delivery 
of certain items of equipment and to 
regulatory clearance, completion of the 
project was delayed by approximately 
three months.all of the group’s cash 
balances are held in bank accounts in the uk 
and russia.the risk of insufficient demand for the 
group’s gas is considered low.at present, the 
impact on the group’s operations of any 
such change of tax regime is unknown.in addition, the group is 
subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in 
which it operates.at 31 december 
2017 , the group had budgeted capital 
expenditures of us$5.9 million, of which 
the significant items were us$1.4 million for 
completion of the lpg project and us$3.2 
million for drilling of sidetrack wells and 
other development activities.he is a member 
of the investment committees of 
three baring vostok funds.compliance
as volga gas plc is quoted on the aim 
market of the london stock exchange, 
it is neither required to comply with the 
2014 uk corporate governance code that 
was published by the financial reporting 
council (the “code”) nor issue a statement 
of compliance with it.20 volga gas plc annual report and accounts 2017
report of the directors
the directors present their report together with the 
group’s audited consolidated financial statements for 
the period from 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017.
results and dividend
the group’s results are set out on pages 
28–34 and show a net profit of us$330,000 
for the year ended 31 december 2017 (2016: 
net profit of us$1.2 million).the principal 
activity of the group is the exploration, 
development and production of its gas, 
condensate and oil fields in the volga region 
of european russia.going concern
having made appropriate enquiries and 
having examined the major areas that could 
affect the group’s financial position, the 
directors are satisfied that the group has 
adequate resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future.health, safety and the environment
the group’s policy and practice is to comply 
with health, safety and environmental 
regulations and requirements of the 
countries in which it operates, to 
protect its employees, contractors, 
assets and the environment.remuneration policy
the company’s policy is to maintain levels 
of compensation for the group that are 
comparable and competitive with peer 
group companies, so as to attract and 
retain individuals of the highest calibre, by 
rewarding them as appropriate for their 
contribution to the group’s performance.3  our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit 
materiality for the group financial statements 
as a whole was set at us$350k (2016: 
us$360k), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of group revenues, of which it 
represents 1% (2016: 1 %).we consider group 
revenues to be the most appropriate 
benchmark for overall levels of activity within 
the business and are measured in terms of 
revenue which is also considered one of the 
more prominent metrics in assessing overall 
group performance.5  we have nothing to report on the other 
information in the annual report 
the directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the annual report 
together with the financial statements.— assessing transparency: we assessed whether the group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of tangible and 
intangible assets.— subsidiary audits: the group engagement team has 
performed the audit work for the trading subsidiaries of the 
group, including the impairment review of tangible and 
intangible assets as described above, and considered the 
implication of that work on those subsidiaries’ profits and net 
assets.the consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.capital expenditure is recognised as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets in the financial statements according to the nature of 
the expenditure and the stage of development of the associated field, i.e.in 2016 and 2017 , the group’s revenue 
related to sales of crude oil and condensate collected directly by or delivered to customers and gas sales made at the entry to the gas 
distribution system.(b) credit risk
the group’s maximum credit risk exposure is the fair value of each class of assets, presented in note 3.1(a)(i) of us$8,617 ,000 and us$19,718,000 
at 31 december 2017 and 2016 respectively.the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.the principal items being the completion of the lpg plant and sidetracks to two gas/condensate wells.in aggregate the 
sensitivities yielded net present values in excess of carrying values for the cgus; in all of these cases, the net present value under the 
sensitivities remained above the carrying value of individual cgus.a further sensitivity in which lpg was excluded from the production profile brought the value in use down to approximately us$1.5 million, or 
2.9% below the level of the carrying value of the vm and dobrinskoye cgu under the base case assumptions and up to us$8.6 million or 16.6% 
below the carrying value under the various sensitivity cases outlined above.however, the impairment testing model is based on the existing 
and approved plans and forecasts in which lpg is one of the drivers of future cash flows.in addition, the results of drilling and other 
exploration or development or production activity will often provide additional information regarding the group’s reserve base that may result 
in increases or decreases to reserve volumes.(h) audit fees – group and company: disclosure of the fees paid to the company’s auditor and its associates is given in note 22. notes to the ifrs consolidated financial statements
