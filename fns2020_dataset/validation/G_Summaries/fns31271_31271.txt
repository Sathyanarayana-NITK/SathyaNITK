under the terms of the spa, serica will benefit from a 40% share of 2018 net 
cashflow from the acquired assets rising on a stepped basis to 100% in 2022. 
the amount generated in the period up to completion, adjusted for notional 
tax, will be offset against the £12.8 million consideration due at completion.a tender 
process is underway to contract a drilling rig to commence drilling of the 
exploration well in h2 2018. though serica has been careful to manage its 
exploration commitments during the industry downturn, this well, targeting 
material hydrocarbon volumes, is close to infrastructure within the general 
erskine/lomond area making it a strong candidate for early development 
should the well prove successful and will be drilled at no cost to serica.the financial asset of us$2.7 million reflects the fair value 
as at 31 december 2017 of a prepayment for gas put 
options covering production volumes through 2018 to 
1h 2020, purchased in conjunction with signing the bkr 
assets acquisition agreement (2016: us$nil).the company 
also paid the third us$2.8 million tranche of erskine 
consideration to bp and significant corporate costs 
arising from the bkr assets acquisition.this 
balance comprises the us$3.0 million (including accrued 
interest) final tranche of erskine consideration payable 
to bp on 1 july 2018, us$1.5 million of liabilities associated 
with the bkr assets acquisition, capital and operational 
liabilities for the erskine interest, a us$0.8 million non-
cash overlift liability reflecting the combined year end 
liquids overlift position (2016: us$0.4 million underlift 
classified as an asset within trade and other receivables) 
and other creditors and accruals for e&e asset, corporate 
and administrative expenditure.risk mitigation

prices
price mitigation strategies may be employed at the 
point of major capital commitment
oil and gas price hedging contracts may be utilised 
where viable

in addition to the principal risks and uncertainties described herein, the group is subject to a number of other risk 
factors generally, a description of which is set out in our latest annual information form available on www.sedar.com.individual directors may engage outside advisors at the 
expense of the company upon approval by the board in 
appropriate circumstances.the terms of reference of the corporate

and compensation committees can be found on the 
company’s website www.serica-energy.com
corporate governance and nomination committee
the corporate governance and nomination committee 
is responsible for the company’s observance of the 
uk code and the corporate governance guidelines 
where they apply to the company, for compliance with 
the rules of aim, the rules applicable to designated 
foreign issuers in canada and for other corporate 
governance matters, including compliance with the 
company’s share dealing code and with aim in respect 
of dealings by directors or employees in the company’s 
shares.the responsibilities and operation of the audit 
committee are more particularly set out in the 
company’s audit committee charter, a copy of which 
is available on the company’s website at www.serica-
energy.com.he was promoted 
to the position of chief operating office in march 2011 and appointed to the board of 
serica in september 2012. he left serica in may 2015 to become chief executive officer 
of circle oil plc.under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the group and the company and the profit or loss of the group for that period.the directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements and, having a reasonable expectation that 
the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
will continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.■ we validated that the updated 
reserves and resources estimates 
were included appropriately in the 
group’s preparation of the cash 
flow forecasts for the assessment of 
the going concern assumption, the 
determination of the deferred tax 
asset, accounting for dd&a and as 
part of management’s consideration 
of indicators of impairment.we take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and 
effectiveness of group wide controls, changes in the business environment and other internal factors when assessing 
the level of work to be performed at each entity.for the remaining three 
components (“specific scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that 
component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial 
35 serica energy plc annual report and accounts 2017 statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.independent auditor’s report

financial statements
36 serica energy plc annual report and accounts 2017 performance materiality
the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.the performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group as a whole and our assessment of 
the risk of misstatement at that component.our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.opinions on other matters prescribed by the companies act 2006
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 ■ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 ■ the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.the key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are: the assessment of commercial reserves, the impairment of the group 
and company’s assets (including oil & gas development assets and exploration and evaluation “e&e” assets), and the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets.the carrying amount is dependent on the assumption that the terms of the licence extension to september 
2018 continue to be met, as outlined in further detail in the review of operations.the most significant pricing assumptions are based on forward curve prices for the first three 
years.the amount recognised is the estimated present value of future expenditure determined in accordance with local 
conditions and requirements.transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset are capitalised 
unless they relate to a financial asset classified at fair value through profit and loss in which case transaction costs are 
expensed in the income statement.provisions
provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation.the cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the ‘vesting period’).in addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any 
modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified 
award, both as measured on the date of the modification.deferred tax is provided using the liability method and tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.notes to the financial statements continued
