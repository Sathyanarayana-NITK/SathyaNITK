conviviality direct
strategy
communicating the unique 
conviviality direct proposition 
clearly to target customers and 
strategic partners in the on trade 
strengthening the position as 
a centre of expertise in wine 
and be at the forefront of range 
innovation, particularly in world 
beers and spirits in the dynamic 
drinks sector
leveraging scale and reach to 
become the most competitive 
wholesaler	in	the	drinks	 market
growing the number of food-
led outlets served and the mix 
of products across each outlet
growing share in major cities 
and inner urban areas through  
a superior service proposition
developing the tools and 
capabilities 	to	 ensure	we	
provide the most value-adding 
customer service in the market
opposite: a selection of wine lists designed 
by conviviality direct.this approach by the buying 
teams has also resulted in the stated buying synergies 
set out at the acquisition of matthew clark being 
achieved for this financial year, which is a demonstration 
of the quality of the buying team and the support of the 
enlarged group by our supply base.once the system 
implementations are complete at the end of autumn 
2017, we will have the opportunity to realise back office 
synergies, drive further improvements for customers 
and improve the ways of working across the group.looking 
ahead, the team are confirming the plans for the group 
logistics strategy whereby we continue to focus on 
delighting customers and growing the business and, in 
doing so, achieve a greater level of efficiency.conviviality’s creative input into our marketing and sponsorship 
execution plans for the year ahead, and support tools to deliver 
these at events such as henley regatta or scottish rugby, is a 
huge benefit to our company at this stage of our growth curve.conviviality offers career 
development opportunities for all 
employees across the group; in the 
franchise business, through to the on 
trade wholesale business, as well as 
career opportunities across logistics, 
marketing, buying and finance.the group has a relatively small 
leadership team and the loss of 
any key individual could impact on 
the group’s future performance.failure 
to implement the integration plan 
effectively could result in lower 
synergies and result in short term 
disruption to the group’s business.conviviality’s reliance on tobacco sales has substantially 
reduced with tobacco sales mix falling from 30% in the 
year ending april 2015 to 7% in the year ending 30 april 
2017.
the group’s reputation for value has mitigated the 
impact of the introduction of plain packaging with like 
for like tobacco sales down only 1.2%.this resulted in lower sales per store in fy17 
and, as the franchisee closed or sold a number of the smaller 
underperforming stores, the number of closures increased to 
63 (fy16: 34).6. revenue for the corresponding prior period is calculated as 
revenue for the 52 week period ended 1 may 2016 plus revenue 
for businesses acquired in both the current period and the prior 
period assuming those businesses were part of the group from 
the start of the prior period.each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract 
requiring 12 months’ notice of termination on either side.25% of awards will be based 
on individual targets focused on ensuring the future performance and delivery of the change 
programme and the remaining 25% will be based on personal objectives.at each agm of the company, the company’s 
articles of association require that one-third 
of the directors (or the number nearest to but 
not exceeding one-third when the number 
of directors is not a multiple of three) shall 
retire from office and stand for reappointment 
by shareholders, however, the company has 
elected to adopt best practice and have all 
directors stand for reappointment at each 
annual general meeting.the group will continue to review and 
develop operating documentation and controls 
as the business develops.it is the group’s policy to abide by all laws,
