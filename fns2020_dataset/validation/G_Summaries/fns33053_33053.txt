our business, financial condition and
results of operations, and consequently
the price of the hanson shares and the
amount and timing of any dividends that
we pay, will be influenced by a range 
of factors, many of which are beyond 
the control of hanson and its board.disruption to, or increased costs of, 
the supply of materials, energy and fuel
to hanson and the supply of finished
products to hanson’s customers could
significantly reduce hanson’s profitability.we encourage organised school groups
to visit our sites and also hold open days
for members of the community, including
the families of our employees.the terms of appointment of the directors in office at the
time of the agm in 2005 have been changed to entitle

55 the board manages overall control of the company’s
affairs with reference to the schedule of matters
reserved for its authorisation and approval, review and
responsibility.having considered the balance of
skills and experience on the board, a candidate profile
for the search was agreed.the directors are responsible for ensuring that the
group keeps proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the group and enable them to ensure that the
accounts comply with the companies act 1985. they
are responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard
the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.legislation in the uk
governing the preparation and dissemination of
accounts may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.consequently,
for the grant made in 2003, it is anticipated that 56% of the number of shares under option will become exercisable
following the end of the three-year performance period.the
option grants made to them and outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance criteria as outlined above.under the black-scholes option valuation model, on the basis of the company’s three year share price
performance, the value of an option over a share at the date of grant in 2005 was equal to approximately 30% of the
share’s current market value.on this basis, with no discount to the black-scholes value because of the application
of performance conditions on exercise, the conditional options granted during 2005 at 100% of basic salary had a
value, at the date of grant, of about 30% of basic salary.our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.share-based payments
the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after november 7 , 2002, is measured at fair value on the date of grant 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.from the end of the vesting period until settlement, the liability represents the full
fair value of the award as at the balance sheet date.dividends
dividends attributable to the equity holders of the company declared during the year are recognised directly in equity.the difference
between the spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of the net interest payable over the period of the contract.further details in relation to the tsr measurement are provided in the remuneration report.the excess is available to the group.legal, insurance, environmental and other provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending
in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation.if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the continuing operating profit
of the group would have been £491.4m (£417 .0m) and turnover from continuing operations would have been £3,777 .9m (£3,581.5m).26 contingent liabilities
litigation relating to certain discontinued operations
certain of the company’s us subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, are the subject of claims or lawsuits both on an
individual and class action basis for bodily injury or property damage, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals,
in particular for the wood treating industry.the current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the principal uk and us defined benefit plans in 2005 and 2004 are:

as required under ias 19, the effects of experience gains and losses on plan assets and liabilities shown above for 2005 and 2004 exclude the 
effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.pensions
under both ifrs and us gaap , the pension cost or credit is determined by reference to the pension liability and the market value of the underlying
plan assets, after adjustment to reflect any previously unrecognised pension obligations or assets.under ifrs, the group has opted not to apply the
corridor approach and this, therefore, represents a difference in accounting methodology between ifrs and us gaap .where employees are required to
continue working until they are terminated to be eligible for the termination benefit and that period exceeds the minimum retention period, the cost is
recognised ratably over the retention period.us gaap , however, only permits recognition of such consideration once the
contingency is resolved and the amount to be paid is determinable.as of february 21, 2006,
hanson has been notified of the following persons who, directly or indirectly, are interested in 3% or more of the issued share capital.an analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area is
found in note 4 of the notes to the accounts.dividends paid out of current or accumulated earnings in foreign
currency to a us shareholder will be includable in the income of a 
us shareholder in a us dollar amount calculated by reference to the
exchange rate on the date the dividend is received, regardless of
whether the dividend is in fact converted into us dollars on such date.
