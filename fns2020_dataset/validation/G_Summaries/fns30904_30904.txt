measures to mitigate the impacts.finance director
■ manages the group’s financial affairs; and 
■ supports the chief executive in the implementation 
and achievement of group strategy.the board ensures that the tone is 
set from the top and the executive directors ensure that our 
core values are embedded throughout the group by meeting 
regularly with all divisions, attending and participating in their 
staff conferences and running sessions at the leadership 
development programme, where participants are asked to 
consider what the core values mean for them individually 
and for the group as a whole.the chairman 
reviews on an annual basis each of the director’s training 
undertaken and any development needs.there were, however, areas identified for future focus by the board which are highlighted 
in the table on the following page.the board recognises the value 
and independence that the longer-serving directors continue to 
bring.the committee noted the length of 
tenure of patrick de smedt as non-executive director and chair 
of the remuneration committee and concluded that the new 
non-executive director should have the requisite skills to 
succeed patrick as remuneration committee chair during 2018.
the committee appointed a sub-committee consisting of 
the chairman, the chief executive and the senior independent 
director to manage the recruitment of a new non-executive.in addition, 
the steering group agreed to undertake a materiality survey in 
2018 to ensure that our responsible business strategy and the 
sustainable development goals that we had agreed to adopt 
remained relevant and appropriate.fair, balanced and understandable assessment

for the board to confirm that the annual report and financial 
statements (annual report), taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy (see the strategic report from the

complex contract positions and the accounting thereon under the percentage of completion 
methodology.we have performed full audit procedures for the significant 
components which account for 92% (2016: 95%) of the group’s revenue, 84% (2016: 90%) of the group’s reported profit before 
tax and 91% (2016: 90%) of the group’s absolute net assets.the directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial

between current accounting standards and ifrs 15:

recognition of

current treatment
when estimating contract revenue the group includes uncertain amounts to the extent 
that they are probable to be received from the customer.future treatment
revenue relating to uncertain amounts will only be recognised when it becomes highly 
probable to be received from the customer.the accounting policies of new subsidiaries are changed where 
necessary to align them with those of the group.the calculation is performed 
by a qualified actuary on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.relevant 
factors that are considered include the point at which legal ownership of the land passes to the customer, the degree to which 
the customer can specify the major structural elements of the design prior to construction work commencing and the degree 
to which the customer can specify modifications to the major structural elements of the building during construction.the table below reconciles the tax charge for the year to tax at the uk statutory rate:
