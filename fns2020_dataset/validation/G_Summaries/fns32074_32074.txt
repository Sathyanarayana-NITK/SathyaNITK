the overall cloud analytics market stands with a total revenue of 
$7.5bn in 2015, and is expected to grow to $23.1bn at a compound 
annual growth rate (cagr) of 25.1% from 2015 to 2020.
the growth in data is well documented with the majority of industry 
analysts pointing towards exponential growth in consumer, m2m, 
mobile and enterprise data while industry players are basing their 
business models on 5–10x growth in volume of data over the next 
five years.the payback from investing funds into the 
business takes time and management expects 
this payback to continue into the current year, 
and beyond, as the investment into sales, 
marketing and product innovation bears fruit.the investment into product development will 
yield market-ready services to drive further 
revenue growth; payback here will take longer 
but should drive incremental returns.going concern
following the placement of 111,142,031 
ordinary £0.005 shares at the price of £0.045 
on 15 may 2017, the directors believe that the 
group has sufficient resources to continue 
trading for the foreseeable future.disclosure of information to auditor
the directors who held office at the date 
of approval of this directors’ report confirm 
that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the company’s 
auditor is unaware, and each director has 
taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.the chairman, 
john o’hara, is a member of each of the 
board committees.the board has 
a list of matters reserved for its consideration 
which include, but are not limited to, matters 
of strategy, risk management, consideration 
and approval of financial budgets, major 
capital expenditure decisions, acquisitions 
and disposals, approval of the interim and 
final results and the recommendation of any 
dividends.john o’hara is the other 
permanent member of this committee, which 
co-opts other directors as necessary for its 
deliberations.the committee is responsible for 
considering the selection, and re-appointment, 
of the directors.the group’s internal financial control procedures 
and monitoring systems include:
• an annual budgetary process to set 
appropriate measurable targets for 
monitoring group progress;
• financial policies and approval processes 
to ensure proper authorisation is obtained 
for spending;
• segregation of duties within 
financial management;
• maintenance of proper records for the 
production of accurate and timely financial 
information; and
• detailed monthly reporting to the board 
against the operating budget and analysis 
of cash management.going concern
notwithstanding that the group has made losses in the current year, these financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, 
which assumes that the group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.following the placement 
of 111,142,031 ordinary £0.005 shares at the price of £0.045 on 15 may 2017, the directors believe that the group has sufficient working capital 
to meet its present requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of this consolidated financial information.judgements and estimates
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the group’s accounting policies.the remainder of the contract 
value (20%) is recognised over the course of each appropriate period.deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.contributions payable to the group’s pension scheme are charged to the income statement 
in the period to which they relate.trade and other payables
trade payables are stated at their original invoiced value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the 
expected payment period is not considered to be material.borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method.segment reporting
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reporting of the business to the executive directors, who have 
been identified as the chief operating decision-maker.all segment revenue, loss before taxation, assets and liabilities are attributable to the principal activity of the group, being the provision of data 
analytics using a proprietary form.financial statements

dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.the group policy is to try to match the timing 
of the settlement of sales and purchase invoices so as to eliminate, as far as possible, currency exposure.the fair value review is also incomplete as the final workings for the net working capital adjustment and contingent
