our performance continued
during the year we delivered homes on a number of key 
regeneration schemes within our southern region, including 
at acton, where we delivered 276 homes completing three 
phases and we commenced development on further phases 
including the neighbourhood centre.we ended the year with net cash of £77.4m 
(2016: £12.0m), slightly higher than planned due 
to the delayed start of two developments in 
our partnerships division which will begin early 
in the new financial year.the adjusted rate has reduced due to a reduction in disallowable 
expenditure during the year, due to the ipo transaction costs and the 
redemption of mandatory redeemable preference shares in the prior 
year.performance
we continue to set strategic sustainability 
objectives based on our material issues.this reflects the growth of the company and opening of additional 
offices and floors in existing buildings.countryside properties plc // annual report 2017

risk management process
risk management
how we manage risk
risk identification and management is built into 
every aspect of countryside’s daily operations, 
ranging from the appraisal of new sites, assessment 
of the prospects of planning success, building 
safely and selling effectively to achieve long-term 
success through the property market cycle.these forecasts also incorporate severe but 
plausible downside case scenarios, illustrating 
the potential impact upon viability of one or more 
of the group’s principal risks crystallising during 
the period, both individually and in combination.based on the feedback received, the board concluded 
that the board and its committees continue to operate effectively.all non-executive directors and the chairman then met to evaluate 
the performance of the group chief executive, ian sutcliffe.shareholders will continue to be given the opportunity 
to meet the chairman and directors in the coming 12 months.corporate governance report continued

shortly before publication of the full-year financial 
results for 2017, the audit committee undertook 
a detailed assessment of the viability statement 
and recommended to the board that the 
directors can believe that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three-year period of their 
assessment.none of the findings related to the 
group’s accounting policies.presentation of non-underlying items
during the year, the group presented certain restructuring costs and the 
impact of a change in the discount rate applied to deferred land and overage 
payments as non-underlying items and excluded them from adjusted 
profit measures.up to two-thirds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the remainder deferred 
into shares for a period of three years (subject to continued employment).the table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration:
remuneration element recruitment policy

of which were set out in the 2016 annual report and accounts.performance is measured over three financial 
years to 30 september 2020. 
the tnav targets are subject to committee discretion to make such adjustments as are appropriate in the event that the company’s dividend policy 
changes in future years.countryside entered into a new 
£300m revolving credit facility on 12 may 2016, 
expiring in may 2021. the first of two options 
on the first and second anniversaries was 
exercised extending the facility to may 2022.
relationship agreement with 
controlling shareholders
where a listed company has a controlling 
shareholder, it is required to have in place at all 
times a written and legally binding agreement 
which is intended to ensure that the controlling 
shareholder complies with the independence 
provisions set out in lr 6.1.4d.corporate governance
a report on countryside’s corporate 
governance framework, together with its 
compliance with the principles and provisions 
of the uk corporate governance code can 
be found in the corporate governance report 
on page 46. the corporate governance report 
forms part of this directors’ report and is 
incorporated into it by cross-reference.share capital
at the date of this report, 450,000,000 
ordinary shares (the same number as at 
admission to the london stock exchange) 
of £0.01 each have been issued, are fully paid 
up and are admitted to trading on the london 
stock exchange.independence
we remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the 
uk, which includes the frc’s ethical standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.we obtained an understanding of management’s process for preparing a site forecast and 
evaluated management’s controls over cost forecasting and changes to forecasts.• the directors’ explanation on page 37 of the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.the parent company financial statements are on pages 119 to 124.
initial public offering (“ipo”)
the company listed its shares on the london stock exchange on 17 february 2016. prior to the ipo, there was a reorganisation of the group, which 
is described in the 2016 financial statements.it is not expected that this change will have a material impact on the reported results of the group, 
but will introduce an element of volatility in the group’s reported profit as the valuation of the shared equity loan portfolio changes.the 
original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.examples of material and non-recurring items which may give rise to disclosure as non-underlying items are:
• fees incurred in relation to business combinations or capital market transactions; 
• adjustments to the statement of financial position that do not relate to trading activity such as the recognition and reversal of non-trade impairments; 
• the impact of material and non-recurring changes to discount rates;
• accelerated write off of unamortised issue costs on the re-financing of borrowings; and
• the costs of group restructuring exercises.the directors consider the credit rating of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts 
outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.the shares vest after three years subject to the employee remaining in the employment of the group.
