average number 
of employees
the average number of employees to 
rise only modestly as the volume of 
housebuilding increases.we believe these areas of the market, both in terms of pricing and location, will continue to remain relatively 
stable over the medium term, largely underpinned by the structural imbalance in the housing market which is continuing to witness 
excess demand over supply.the gross 
development value of this site is expected 
to be in excess of £120 million and we 
anticipate the project will take approximately 
seven years to complete.we submitted a 
planning application for the third and final 
phase of 87 apartments in september 2017. 
this is a dense urban site which provides an 
exciting opportunity to create a new vibrant 
waterfront destination that links in with the 
canal and rivers trust plans for the area.once the quantum of the executive 
directors’ bonuses has been calculated, 
these will be settled as to 50% in cash and 
as to 50% by the issue of ordinary shares 
of the company.long term incentive plans
the company operates both an unapproved 
share option scheme, which is open to all 
employees of inland homes and the 2013 
ltip for the executive directors.the non-executive directors’ letters of 
appointment do not provide specifically for 
any termination payments, although the 
company might make payments in lieu  
of notice.directors’ interests in shares and the unapproved share  
option scheme and the 2013 ltip (audited)
directors’ interests in the company’s ordinary shares are disclosed in the directors’ report.in aggregate, to date, the conditions 
for the issue of 6,000,000 of the 11,350,504 new ordinary shares that can be issued in exchange for vested growth shares have been met 
in accordance with the rules of the 2013 ltip.the directors have proposed a final 
dividend of 1.2p per share (2016: 0.9p) 
payable on 26 january 2018, subject to 
shareholders’ approval, to shareholders at 
the close of business on 29 december 2017.

independent auditor’s report to the 
members of inland homes plc
opinion
we have audited the financial statements of 
inland homes plc (the ‘parent company’) 
and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the 
year ended 30 june 2017 which comprise 
the group income statement, the group and 
company statement of financial position, 
the group statement of cash flows, the 
group and company statement of changes 
in equity and the related notes, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.conclusions relating  
to going concern
we have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
isas (uk) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in 
the financial statements any identified 
material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the group’s or 
the parent company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.the valuation of the group’s income generating investment 
properties requires significant judgements to be made in 
relation to the appropriate market capitalisation yields and 
estimated rental values.• we reviewed the significant valuation inputs used by the directors 
against our own expectations, underlying supporting evidence and, 
where relevant, market data.we 
checked the calculation against the forecast appraisals to ensure 
that the allocation was in line with the split of future revenue for the 
different stages of the site.this was 
considered the most appropriate measure 
given that the nature of the entity is as a 
holding company.misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements.further information on this assessment can be found in note 3. further information on the financial 
impact of this reassessment can be found in note 29.
disclosure exemptions adopted
in preparing the financial statements of the parent company, advantage has been taken of all disclosure exemptions conferred by  
frs 101. therefore, the parent company financial statements do not include:
• certain comparative information as otherwise required by eu endorsed ifrs;
• a statement of cash flows;
• the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
• disclosure of related party transactions with other wholly owned members of the group headed by inland homes plc.the company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the companies act 2006 and has not presented its own 
profit and loss account in these financial statements.ifrs 15 – the directors consider that there is a potential impact on adoption of the standard on the accounting for long term construction 
contracts.the directors have considered the present economic climate, the state of the 
housing market and the current demand for land with planning consent.basis of consolidation
the group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up 
to 30 june 2017. where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary.all subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the joint venture are recognised in the 
group’s carrying amount of the investment.contract income
the group acts as a main contractor on certain building projects, primarily on behalf of housing associations where the group must 
provide social housing units as part of its s106 obligations under the planning consent or has sold the land to the housing association 
and entered into a construction contract to provide the completed units.depreciation
depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by the straight line 
method where it reflects the basis of consumption of the asset.the amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.whilst the directors exercise due care and attention to make reasonable estimates, taking into account all available information in 
estimating the future selling price, the estimates will, in all likelihood, differ from the actual selling prices achieved in future periods  
and these differences may, in certain circumstances, be very significant.inland homes annual report and accounts 2017 84 stock code: inl 25624.01 – 11 october 2017 11:42 am – proof 2

investment properties due to sufficient capital losses not being available.along with the group’s capital investment of £nil (after recognising the group’s 
share of losses), loans of £4,371,000 have been provided which are accounted for as amounts due from joint ventures within current 
assets in the group statement of financial position.
