* certain prior year amounts, previously reported in underlying performance, have been reclassified for consistency with the cu rrent period presentation as separately 
reported items.in addition, the directors have considered the trading performance neces sary  
to result in a breach of the banking covenants as well as mitigating factors that would be available and actionable in the even t that the 
adverse performance became reality.such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporar y difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than  
in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the acc ounting profit.leasing commitments 
leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of owners hip to the 
group.in the absence of a recent market transaction, the recoverable amount of the goodwill held by  
the group is determined from value in use calculations.the risk free in terest rate is the yield on zero-coupon uk 
government bonds at the date of grant of the respective awards over a term consistent with the vesting period.the risk free interest rate is the yield on zero-
coupon uk government bonds at the date of grant of the resp ective awards over a term consistent with the vesting period.we challenged the key assumptions – namely that 
stores making a loss below a certain threshold are excluded from 
the model as directors’ view is that, as an improvement plan is in 
place and given the level of loss at these stores they are not 
permanently impaired.as part of our audit 
we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
