charge for the current year has been charged to the statement of comprehensive income of this £110,452 relates to directors.it consists of the reduction in deferred 
consideration payable of £1,179,146 and the associated unwinding of discounting on deferred consideration in the year (see note 12) and,  
an impairment charge of £500,000 against the master franchise agreement following a revaluation due to evidence suggesting that the

as a result of restructuring the group.the cash flows arising were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital which included a small companies’ risk premium to allow for 
factors such as illiquidity in the shares.this resulted in a total value for each company of the identifiable intangibles assets that exceeded 
the carrying values of the respective companies’ goodwill.the value in use of the goodwill arising 
on the acquisition of ewemove sales & lettings ltd (“esl ") is based on the cash flows derived from the actual revenues and operating 
margins for 2017 and projections through to 31 december 2024. thereafter projected revenue growth was assumed to 2.2% per annum.various events since acquisition, notably the founders deciding to leave the business, the decision to actively recruit experienced estate 
agents and the decision to change the licence fee, have caused a higher than originally projected attrition rate of franchisees who existed at 
acquisition.as these revenue streams represent the return from all the assets employed in generating those revenues, the fair value and expected rate 
of return of these other assets, known as the contributory asset charge, was determined and deducted.
