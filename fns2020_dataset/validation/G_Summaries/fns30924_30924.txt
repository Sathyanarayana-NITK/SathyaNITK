• during the evaluation and due diligence phase prior to the initial investment, focus is placed on an analysis 
of the risks of the clinical phase of development.while in the private sector, rick built one of the most influential and successful public 
affairs companies in the united states.rick was appointed to the board in may 2014, but was a member of the 
predecessor company board since 2011. rick serves on each of the audit and nomination (chair) committees, 
and served on the remuneration committee until november 2017 when he was replaced by harry rein.these 
statements reflect the board’s current view, are subject to a number of material known and unknown events, risks 
and uncertainties, and could change in the future.in summary, the directors have assessed the viability of the group over the three year period to december 2020. 
they were comforted by the group’s strong financial position, its ability to raise or borrow capital, its long-
term investment objectives, the stability of the business model, the group’s control over its investments and how 
working capital requirements are met.the initial terms of reference for each of the committees, which are 
fully compliant with the provisions of the code and which reflect both best practice and the recommendations 
arising from the external evaluation process undergone by the board and its committees in connection with the 
company’s ipo, were adopted by the board during 2014. these were reviewed and updated in november 
2017, and will be reviewed annually on an ongoing basis and updated where necessary.the division of responsibilities between the chairman and 
the chief executive officer is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the board.in addition, the nomination committee reviews the senior leadership needs of the 
group to enable it to compete effectively in the marketplace.the board, with full participation of all the 
chairman of the board and all other non-executive directors, spent time considering the future strategic direction 
of the group and, with input from advisors to the group, compiled a ceo role profile.the 
key risks and uncertainties faced by the group, as well as the relevant mitigations, are set out on pages 36 to 
43.greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions
given the overall size of the group, we consider the direct environmental impact of the group as relatively 
low.based on this review and the application of the remuneration policy, 
the remuneration committee resolved that no further changes were necessary or appropriate, and the current 
remuneration policy will remain in effect.the tables below summarise the key aspects of the company’s remuneration policy for executive 
directors.there are no performance 
conditions attached to the 
payment of benefits.the group tsr will be 
measured relative to the ftse 250, the s&p 
500, and a peer group of four publicly-traded 
companies.participation in the phantom 
plan is evidenced by “units.”
vesting of units is determined 
at the time of grant of the 
units.differences between the remuneration policy and that applied to employees generally
the components of remuneration set out on the previous pages for executive directors are also generally applied 
to the group’s senior management team and differ only in vesting terms, values and award maxima.based upon the results of the benchmarking study and the strong company performance in 2016, the remuneration 
committee recommended to the board the following for 2017:
• for chris silva, an increase in base salary from $515,000 to $600,000, and in increase of maximum cash 
incentive bonus award from 150% of base salary to 187.5% of base salary (125% at target), in both cases 
to address the continued peer benchmarking results that placed the ceo below the median;
• for jill smith, during the period that she served as “interim” chief executive officer, she was paid a base 
salary of $100,000 per month, and she was not be eligible for any cash incentive bonus awards, ltip 
awards, or any other incentive or equity schemes; and
• for jill smith, commencing on 26 may 2017 when she transitioned to serve as “permanent” chief executive 
officer and president, her base salary was set at $600,000, and her maximum cash incentive bonus award 
was set at 225% of base salary (150% at target), to be pro-rated for her number of days of service as 
“permanent” ceo during 2017.
the remuneration committee designed the increase in base salary and potential increase in cash incentive 
bonus award to reflect its policy of moving the executive director compensation, in connection with target 
performance, towards the median of the peer group.further details of the effect of his 
resignation and the calculation of payments and benefits are given on pages 98 to 100. the policy 
requires executive directors to acquire and maintain a minimum ownership level of ordinary shares in the 
capital of the company, thereby helping to align their interests with those of shareholders.in accordance with the code, ms. smith will submit herself for election at the agm, and for annual re-election 
by shareholders at each agm.in assessing independence, the audit committee 
received the auditor’s presentation and confirmation that in its professional judgment, kpmg llp is independent 
within the meaning of regulatory and professional requirements and the objectivity of the partner and audit staff 
is not impaired.overview

2. key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.these matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.the policy adopted by the group is detailed in note 11. 
the group’s subsidiaries are, for the most part, still at the 
development stage and the majority do not yet generate 
revenues.this has therefore been determined to be a 
significant risk for our audit for the following reasons:
–  as a result of the group policy not to formally revalue 
each subsidiary at each accounting period end there 
is significant judgement required to assess if there 
has been an indication of a decrease in the value of 
a subsidiary, therefore requiring a valuation;
–  where there is a valuation driven by discounted 
cash flow (dcf), the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting the trading of such companies and the 
significant level of judgement required to determine 
the assumptions used in the dcfs such as discount 
rate, revenue and ebit forecasts and probability of 
success and the valuations are sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions.our procedures included:
–  comparing valuations: comparing the carrying 
amount of the investment to the market capitalisation 
of the group, as allied minds limited contains all of 
the group’s trading operations.subsidiaries
the financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, 
using consistent accounting policies.any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-
controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.the amount recognised 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based 
on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting 
date.as of 19 june 2014, the maximum 
number of options reserved under the plan were issued and outstanding and as a result of the company’s ipo 
in 2014, all issued and outstanding options vested on 19 june 2014. the company does not intend to make 
any further grants under the u.s. stock plan.in 2012, the board of directors adopted the amended and restated 2007 phantom plan.due to 
the nature of activities and with the aim to maintain the investors’ funds secure and protected, the group’s policy 
is to hold any excess funds in highly liquid and readily available financial instruments and reduce the exposure 
to other financial risks.
