notes
fixed pay consists of salary from 1 april 2018. the value of benefits 
and pension have been estimated for 2018.during the year, the committee consisted of the following non-executive directors: rebecca miskin (chair), robert boyle, william 
eccleshare and ron sandler.in the case of each director in office at the date 
the directors’ report is approved:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information which the group and company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the group and company’s auditors are aware of that information.to the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the frc’s ethical standard were not provided to 
the group or the company.we also considered the amount of the provision included in the disposal of the 
home interest business and found this to be reasonable.strategic report and directors’ report
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the strategic report and directors’ report 
for the year ended 31 december 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.(ca06)
the directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that 
would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 22 of the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.adjustments are made in respect of:
• exceptional items – the group considers items of income and expense as exceptional and excludes them from the adjusted results 
where the nature of the item, or its magnitude, is material and likely to be non-recurring in nature so as to assist the user of the financial 
statements to better understand the results of the core operations of the group.• share-based payments – share-based payment expenses or credits are excluded from the adjusted results of the group as the directors 
believe that the volatility of these charges can distort the user’s view of the core trading performance of the group.the directors use this measure to assess the performance of the group 
as it excludes volatile items not related to the core trading of the group, and includes the group’s management of capital expenditure.where the deferred 
consideration is contingent on the continued employment of the vendors, such arrangements are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period over which the contingent consideration is earned with an associated 
provision on the consolidated statement of financial position.deferred tax is charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is recognised in other comprehensive income.centaur-ar2017.indd   83 26/03/2018   17:26:05 25895  26 march 2018 5:23 pm  proof five 25895  26 march 2018 5:23 pm  proof five
