note 1: there were employment period and performance conditions in relation to the 81,300 options granted on 25 march 2014 which allowed for vesting in three equal proportions 
on or after the company’s share price reaching 184.5 pence per share, 246 pence per share and 307.5 pence per share.when making their going 
concern assessment the directors assess available and 
committed funds against all non-discretionary expenditure, 
and related cash flows, as forecast for the period ended 
30 april 2019. these forecasts indicate that the group is able 
to settle its liabilities as they fall due in the forecast period.the directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the company’s website.where the acquisition is treated as a business combination, the purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the group.if the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised directly in the income statement.in these forecasts the directors have considered appropriate 
sensitivities such as the level of discretionary expenditure included and the ability to raise additional funds as described above.revenue recognition
revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the 
ordinary course of business and is shown net of value added tax.in preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised 
as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.32 report for the period ending 31 december 2017 xeros technology group plc
notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 december 2017 research and development
expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.research and development tax credits are 
recognised on an accruals basis with reference to the level of certainty regarding acceptance of the claims by hmrc.deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted 
for using the liability method.such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
profit nor the accounting period.the estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and 
liabilities in the financial information are discussed below:
revenue recognition
the group offers an integrated service and care package, marketed under xeros sbeadycare®.as part of determining the appropriate revenue recognition 
policy for such packages, the group is required to determine the relative fair values of the various elements of revenue.36

an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.further details are set out in note 16. at 31 december 2017, the directors were not aware of 
any factors affecting the recoverability of the group’s bank balances.the directors have 
considered the recoverability of outstanding balances at 31 december 2017 and have made provisions for bad and doubtful debts 
amounting to £270,000 (2016: £77,000).58 report for the period ending 31 december 2017 xeros technology group plc
