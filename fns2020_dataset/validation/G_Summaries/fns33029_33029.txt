clinical trial transparency
astrazeneca has a long-standing 
commitment to making information  
about our clinical research publicly 
available to enhance the scientiﬁc 
understanding of how our medicines  
work and in the medical interest of 
patients.our 
efforts are directed towards explaining the 
therapeutic as well as the economic beneﬁts 
of our products to doctors, governments 
and others who pay for healthcare.our 2012 focus
flumist is a trivalent live, attenuated  
nasally delivered vaccine approved for the 
prevention of disease caused by inﬂuenza 
virus subtypes a and b in eligible children 
and adults.faslodex 500mg is now approved in 65 
countries including the member states  
of the eu, the us and japan.this was driven by 
declines in mexico, down 22%, and brazil, 
down 5%.in addition, it is uncertain when any such abbreviated approval 
processes may be fully realised, particularly for more complex 
protein molecules such as mabs.in particular, the marketing, promotional, clinical and pricing 
practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which 
manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers and patients, are subject  
to extensive regulation, litigation and governmental investigation.simon lowth 
chief financial ofﬁcer
 
the purpose of this financial review is  
to provide a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the ﬁnancial performance of the 
business during 2012, the ﬁnancial position 
as at the end of the year and the main 
business factors and trends which could 
affect the future ﬁnancial performance  
of the business.for the uk deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension scheme, which represents 
astrazeneca’s largest deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme, these initiatives have included 
agreeing funding principles for cash 
contributions to be paid to the uk pension 
scheme to target a level of assets in excess 
of the current expected cost of providing 
beneﬁts, and, in 2010, amendments to the 
scheme to freeze pensionable pay at 30 
june 2010 levels.> in august, astrazeneca expanded its 
diabetes alliance with bms to incorporate 
the development and marketing of 
amylin’s portfolio of diabetes products.the group 
notiﬁed bms of its decision to exercise 
the option in august and the balance  
of $135 million will be payable once 
applicable anti-trust and competition 
approvals are received by astrazeneca.further details of this 
collaboration and our accounting 
treatment for this arrangement are 
included in note 9 to the financial 
statements on page 161. under the terms of the agreement, 
astrazeneca made a $50 million upfront 
payment and the companies share  
both costs and proﬁts.astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 97

main work of the remuneration 
committee during 2012
the remuneration committee met 12 times 
in 2012. the individual attendance record  
of remuneration committee members  
is set out on page 113. at the invitation  
of the remuneration committee, except 
where their own remuneration was being 
discussed, the ceo; the executive 
vice-president, human resources & 
corporate affairs; the global head, reward 
& employment; and the vice-president, 
global compensation attended one  
or more remuneration committee meetings 
in 2012 and provided advice and services  
that materially assisted the remuneration 
committee.shareholder and broader context
in all aspects of its work, the remuneration committee considers both the external environment in which the company operates and  
the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders.in doing so, to the extent possible, 
the remuneration committee put in place a framework that maintained broadly the same balance in terms of its constituent elements and 
overall quantum as for the previous ceo, which the remuneration committee considers to be right for astrazeneca and its shareholders.no such determination was made in 2012.
other plans
in addition to the plans described above, the astrazeneca savings-related share option plan and the astrazeneca all-employee share 
plan are operated in the uk, both of which are hm revenue & customs approved plans.astrazeneca is exposed to environmental liabilities relating to its past 
operations, principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation 
costs.astrazeneca is domiciled in the uk but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the uk.astrazeneca annual report and form 20-f information 2012 157
