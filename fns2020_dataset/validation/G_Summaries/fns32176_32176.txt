human diet, which is the equivalent of removing 77 trillion 
calories from consumers’ diets globally.our objective is 
for bulk ingredients to deliver steady earnings from the core 
business and to dampen volatility in commodities, and we

technologies and continuous improvement programmes, 
global operations drives cost and production efficiencies to 
ensure we remain cost competitive in the markets in which

identify the group’s key business, strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance risks, and 
then develop action plans and controls to mitigate 
them as far as possible, to the extent deemed 
appropriate taking account of the group’s risk 
appetite.since 2008 we have reduced 
water use per tonne of production by 1.5%.non-executive directors

be ultimately settled using a constant rate of interest.where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value 
hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is 
adjusted by the change in its fair value attributable to the hedged 
risk only and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is 
effective, it offsets the fair value gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument.impairment on the initial recognition of held for sale assets, and 
gains or losses on subsequent re-measurement, are recognised 
in the income statement.year ended 31 march
