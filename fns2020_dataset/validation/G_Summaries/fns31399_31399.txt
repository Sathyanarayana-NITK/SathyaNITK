us$/boe value than other discoveries in the region, at a us$/boe 
value of 0.4 (excluding royalties), while zohr (egypt) and aphrodite 
(cyprus) have us$/boe values of 1.4 and 0.8, respectively

of the project was approved by the israeli government on  
27 august 2017, with the final investment decision taken  
in the first quarter of 2018 and first gas expected in the  
first half of 2021.

20 energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 21 energean is well positioned, as 
an independent operator in an 
increasingly active region, to advance 
existing and future development and 
exploration prospects.1 based on nsai ionnina and montenegro cpr, october 2017
review of operations continued
karish and tanin
in israel, we made major steps forward in the development of the 
karish and tanin gas fields, acquired from delek energy in 2016. 
engineering work commenced in january 2017 and ran through 
the entire year.the production cost per barrel 
has been affected by the lower production delivered through the year but is still at very competitive levels
 x total group g&a of us$6.0 million (2016: us$4.1 million), the g&a increase, reflects the additional staffing and administrative 
costs caused by the rapid growth of the group’s portfolio with the acquisition of karish and tanin and the efforts to bring the asset 
to final investment decision in early 2018.
the above, coupled with the improved oil price environment during 2017 with a realised sales price of $46.7/barrel (2016: us$34.3) 
resulted in significantly improved financial performance as reflected below:

  underlying adjusted ebitdax, cost of oil production per boe, capital expenditure, cash capex, net debt and gearing are non-ifrs measures and are  
explained later in this section.the group outsources its internal audit 
function, which also provides independent assurance over the 
effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal 
control.link to strategy: 
1
the group’s current oil and gas production and 
related revenue are obtained entirely from the 
prinos basin, located offshore in northeast 
greece.the 
key sources of the risk include loan agreements 
denominated in the u.s. dollar, sales of crude 
oil remunerated in u.s. dollar, ongoing 
operating costs and capital expenditures 
incurred in eur, usd and to a lesser extent 
gbp and nok.based on the results of the analysis the board of directors has a 
reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period of its assessment.the committee considered the assessment of principal risks, 
assessed the group’s prospects in light of its current position 
and reviewed the disclosures on behalf of the board.performance of the committee 
the performance of the nomination and governance committee 
will be assessed by way of an internal process in 2018.
our priorities for 2018
in 2018, the nomination and governance committee will focus 
on succession planning to ensure the group retains senior 
executives with the necessary skills and knowledge to remain 
effective and the committee will work alongside the board to 
prepare and implement the board diversity policy.additionally, the committee 
assesses the performance of the group with regard to the impact 
of decisions and related actions in these areas upon employees, 
communities and other third parties, as well as upon the 
reputation of the group.in addition, the 
non-executive directors are reimbursed for expenses that  
are reasonably required for the performance of their duties.at 31 december 2017, the energean group held certain 
voting rights over energean israel limited but held no 
rights to the economic interests.specifically, the  
group controls an investee if and only if the group has:
 x power over the investee
 x exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
 x the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
 x the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee
 x rights arising from other contractual arrangements
 x the group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.if there is such evidence, the group determines the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.exploration and evaluation costs 
exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for hydrocarbon resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the 
assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.interest income (recorded as finance income in the statement of profit or loss) continues to be accrued on the reduced 
carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.when the circumstances that previously caused 
impairment no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in the inventories’ net realisable value due to a change in the 
economic circumstances, the amount thereof is reversed.3.13 provisions 
provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.according to the prinos concession agreement ratified by greek law, the group is obliged to plug only the wells opened 
resulting from own drilling activities.the group will examine the impact of the above on its financial statements.where level 1 inputs are not available,  
as is the case for estimating a fair value for the convertible loan notes (see note 9) and the option to purchase energean israel class b 
shares (see note 31.4) the group has used a combination of level 2 and level 3 inputs to estimate the fair value.hydrocarbon reserve and resource estimates 
the group’s oil and gas development and production properties are depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate calculated  
by reference to developed and undeveloped proved and probable commercial reserves (2p developed and undeveloped) which  
are estimated to be recoverable with existing and future developed facilities using current operating methods, as determined in 
accordance with petroleum resources management system published by society of petroleum engineers, the world petroleum 
congress and the american association of petroleum geologists.on 30 june 2017, the company also became the parent company of the group through the acquisition of the full share capital  
of energean e&p holdings limited, in exchange for 65,643,120 £0.01 (us$0.013) shares in the company issued to the previous 
shareholders.any increase in the life expectancy of the members  
will increase the defined benefit liability.the nominal tax rate of kavala oil s.a. for the years ended 31 december 2017 and 2016 is 29%.under the reorganisation agreement dated 30 june 2017 and the subsequent supplementary agreement dated 31 october 2017,  
the group also made the following commitments:
 x under the reorganisation agreement dated 30 june 2017, in the event of an exit transaction as defined in the reorganisation 
agreement, the group committed to acquire the preference shares in energean israel limited.the calculations are based on a change in 
the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes 
in interest rates.the tables have been drawn up based 
on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay.on 16 march the company acquired 50% of the preference shares of energean israel from its founder shareholders after paying the 
total consideration of us$10 million (please refer to note 31.4).accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.(l) critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
