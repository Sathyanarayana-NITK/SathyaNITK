the board remains convinced that the right course is to 
preserve the critical capability that underlies our leading market 
position in the sector, and indeed to focus on positioning the business 
to gain market share once the recovery is underway.this personal commitment, an understanding 
second to none of every nuance of the 
industry’s complexities, and a technology 
platform and product perfectly suited to 
our customers’ needs lie at the heart 
of our success.engineers 
are a pleasure to work with.”
 customer comment
enabling real-time 
response across a vast 
estate of critical assets
synectics has been closely associated with protecting critical 
infrastructure since the inception of the company, but the scale 
and sophistication of our solutions is constantly evolving.although revenues from the gaming sector continued 
to be strong, as expected these were lower than those of the previous 
year where sales were exceptional and included two major new 
casino projects in the far east.why we measure
cash conversion indicates how 
successful the business has been 
in generating cash (after replacing 
the capital assets used in generating 
that cash) from the baseline profit 
earned in the period.project highlight: philippines casino
a major gaming and leisure resort in the philippines chose 
synectics to upgrade its incumbent surveillance solution 
to synergy 3. as well as enabling centralised and local/remote 
monitoring and control of 5,450 cameras, the system will 
integrate with the operator’s proprietary casino management 
system, point of sale system and access control solution.i am completely confident that each employee in the group is 
now aware of what synectics’ values are and what behaviours the 
organisation expects from its people to fit in with them.the positive impact from the efforts applied in these areas over 
recent years is quite apparent in discussions with employees 
around the group, in commendations from customers and, more 
quantitatively, from significant improvement in the group’s overall 
measure of customer satisfaction.with its emphasis on high levels of commitment 
and an ethos of never letting customers down, the work environment 
in the group is demanding, and can be sometimes unwittingly harsh 
on very good, uncomplaining people who always want to help.the appointment and removal of the company secretary are 
matters reserved for the board.board appointments
all non-executive directors are provided with a letter of 
appointment on acceptance of the appointment, which includes 
the terms and conditions of their role.the letters of appointment 
are updated as appropriate from time to time and are available on 
request from the company secretary.a copy 
of the terms of reference can be obtained from the company secretary 
or from the governance section of the company’s website 
(www.synecticsplc.com).the policy also seeks to ensure 
that executive directors are rewarded fairly for their individual 
contributions to the group’s performance and to encourage 
appropriate behaviours in line with the group’s attitude to risk.remuneration policy for non-executive directors
non-executive directors are independent of the group and are 
expected to spend an average of approximately two days a month 
on the group’s business.details of the performance of the group are shared with 
all employees at the appropriate time using the methods above.details are set out in the 
remuneration committee report on pages 42 to 45.
policy on payment of suppliers
the group’s policy during the year was to pay suppliers in accordance 
with agreed terms.as a result of this review the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.further details regarding 
the adoption of the going concern basis can be found in note 1 
to the financial statements.by order of the board

expansion into the international 
transport & infrastructure sector
with the oil & gas market still depressed, expansion into the international 
transport & infrastructure sector is the key growth opportunity for the 
group.we do not currently 
see any direct risks to the group as a result of any change, although, as noted 
in the chairman’s statement, the group’s results this year benefited again from 
favourable exchange rate movements in the translation of profits earned overseas.51

with the oil & gas market still depressed, expansion into the international

group.product failure risk
where the group’s product offering fails to meet agreed standards 
there is a risk that the group will be exposed to replacement or rework 
costs as a result of this failure, and the associated reputational impact 
on new business.strategic report and directors’ report 
based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the companies act 2006.for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units (‘cgus’) expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination.gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilised.dividends
dividends proposed by the directors and unpaid at the end of the year are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been 
approved by shareholders at a general meeting of the company.depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land which is not depreciated, 
less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, commencing on the first day of the month after 
being brought into use.to meet these criteria, the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event 
and must be legally enforceable in all of the following circumstances: the normal course of business, the event of default and the event
