our business depends on and creates 
value in the communities where we operate.as finance continues to 
implement the functional 
transformation programme, 
the risk of control degradation 
could increase and this is an 
area of significant focus.skills and experience
stephen has wide-ranging experience, 
particularly in customer-facing businesses, 
together with recognised expertise in 
transforming business performance.the board is satisfied that the committee has the resources and 
expertise to fulfil its responsibilities.the results of the annual process, together with the 
conclusions of the internal reviews by internal audit, inform the annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the system of risk management 
and internal control performed by the audit committee and the 
shesec committee, on behalf of the board, in 2017 .further 
detail is provided in note 7 on pages 129 to 131.
energy supply revenue recognition 
the group’s revenue for energy supply activities includes an estimate of 
energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading 
and an estimated year-end meter reading.the committee also needed to assess the vesting outcome for long-
term incentive awards that were made in early 2015. the ltip awards 
were dependent on adjusted earnings per share (eps), economic profit 
(ep), safety performance, employee engagement and customer 
service delivery as assessed by net promoter scores.the committee believes that this combination creates 
the right balance between doing the right thing for the business, whilst 
aligning executives to the shareholder experience.the aim is to avoid rewarding 
poor performance and to reduce compensation to reflect the departing 
executive’s obligations and to mitigate losses.the centrica plc share incentive plan trust (sip trust) is used 
to purchase shares on behalf of the company for the benefit of 
employees, in connection with the sip .by order of the board

opinion
in our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 december 
2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(ifrss) as adopted by the european union;
• the company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with united kingdom generally accepted 
accounting practice including financial reporting standard 101 
‘reduced disclosure framework’; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the companies act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.centrica plc annual report and accounts 2017 | 107 other information
the directors are responsible for the other information.auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion.the group’s assessment of the potential impact is at the 
date of initial application of ifrs 9 (1 january 2018).the full impact 
of adopting ifrs 9 on the group’s consolidated financial 
statements will depend on the financial instruments the group has 
during 2018, as well as on the economic conditions and 
judgements made as at the 2018 year end.note 4 also contains an analysis of adjusted operating profit after 
taxation by segment and a reconciliation to the statutory results for 
the year.adjusted operating 
cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities 
before: 
● payments relating to exceptional items; 
● deficit reduction payments made to the uk defined benefit 
pension schemes; and 
● movements in variation margin and cash collateral that are 
included in net debt; 
but including: 
● dividends received from joint ventures and associates.deficit reduction payments and movements in variation 
margin and cash collateral are excluded because the directors do 
not consider these to represent the operating cash flows generated 
by underlying business performance, as they are predominantly 
triggered by wider market factors and, in the case of variation margin 
and cash collateral, these represent timing differences.centrica storage gas storage in the uk, including production of cushion gas.centrica financials_back-end.indd   121 16/03/2018   15:49 financial statements | notes to the financial statements

4. segmental analysis 
(b) revenue 
gross segment revenue represents revenue generated from the sale of products and services to both third parties and to other 
reportable segments of the group.to illustrate this, the price assumptions for gas and 
liquids have been varied by +/–10%.fvlcd is determined by discounting 
the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the investment, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions 
that market participants would use in estimating fair value.the company’s software 
and international patents are currently used by over 150 of europe’s largest energy users.on 29 september 2017, the group disposed of its 60% interest in the cq energy canada partnership to a consortium comprising mie 
holding corporation, the can-china global resource fund and mercuria for net proceeds of c$420 million (£255 million) which resulted in 
a loss on disposal of £28 million which was recognised as an exceptional item (see note 7).the most significant 
securities relate to the morecambe and statfjord fields.capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.the intangible asset is surrendered and the liability is extinguished at the end of the compliance period to reflect the consumption of 
economic benefits.adjusted for: growth forecasts which are 
based on sales, marketing activity and 
recent customer acquisitions.for the 
services business, the market share is 
based on historical growth trends and 
planned sales activities by individual 
market sectors.summary of significant accounting policies  
overlift and underlift 
off-take arrangements for gas and oil produced from joint operations are often such that it is not practical for each participant to receive 
or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period.derivative 
assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the intention to net 
settle the derivative contracts is present.centrica financials_back-end.indd   204 16/03/2018   15:50 centrica plc annual report and accounts 2017 | 205
