responsible business principles, which are underpinned 
by the united nations universal declaration of human 
rights, the fundamental conventions of the international

projected sales and margins for the business.the committee considered the group’s current provisioning policy, the historical loss rates incurred on 
inventory held at the balance sheet date and the nature and condition of current inventory.it is the intention that all directors, including the chairs  
of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees, 
will attend the 2017 annual general meeting and will be 
available to answer shareholders’ questions.accordingly, the board

that is invaluable to the delivery of our strategy and the long-term growth of the business.burberry operates two all-employee share plans:
the sharesave scheme offers eligible employees (including 
executive directors) an opportunity to enter into a three- or five-year 
savings contract to save a portion of their salary which can be  
used to purchase burberry shares, normally at the end of the savings 
contract, at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date  
of invitation.the committee also listens to and takes into consideration investor views more generally throughout

ensured the senior executive team continued to be focussed on both the delivery of the key strategies and the management 
of the business in a challenging economic climate.the committee considered christopher’s performance across all of the performance criteria and recognised christopher’s 
personal contribution to the delivery of the five key strategies.the targets set recognised that 2016/17 year was a transitional year for the company and senior team  
and addressed the business need to retain and motivate talent during this critical period.although lower in absolute  
terms than those set in prior years, the committee is satisfied that the targets set for the 2016 esp awards are stretching, 
requiring a demanding level of performance, and are closely linked to our performance goals and aligned with long-term 
value creation for shareholders.for the purpose of assessing revenue growth performance for the esp awards already 
granted, as well as awards to be granted in 2017, revenue for the ‘base year’ has been re-calculated on the assumption that this agreement had applied in that 
year to ensure revenue growth is being calculated on a like-for-like basis with the way targets have been set.christopher bailey was not awarded any increase to his salary for the 2017/18  
year and as such his salary continues to be £1,100,000.the profit for  
the year attributable to equity holders of the company  
was £286.8m (2016: £309.5m)
