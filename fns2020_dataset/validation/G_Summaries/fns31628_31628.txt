as a result of this hedging strategy, any profit 
or loss from the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar will 
largely be delayed until the following financial year and beyond.headcount has fallen by 16 since 
september 2016 to 2,228 mainly attributable to the disposals of 
euromoney indices, latinfinance, hedgefund intelligence and 
ii intelligence and profit protection measures undertaken in the 
asset management segment, offset by the acquisitions of risi 
and layer123.for the year ended 30 september 2016, exceptional payments related to the strategic review in 2016 
and the development of the group’s new strategy.in making the assessment, the directors have considered the 
group’s robust capital position, the cash-generative nature of 
the business, the visibility of subscriptions revenue, the ability 
of the company to cut costs quickly, the access to available 
credit, the absence of significant pension and m&a liabilities 
and the group’s ability to restrict dividends.annual report and accounts 2017

the recently 
announced changes 
to our board provide 
the dual benefits of 
a fresh perspective 
and will enable a 
greater degree of 
code alignment.the committee comprises six members, none of whom is considered 
independent under the code.the 
non-executive directors either meet together or individually with the company’s senior independent director, in both cases without 
the company’s chairman present, at least annually to appraise the chairman’s performance and on other occasions as necessary.euromoney institutional investor plc

nominations committee 
the nominations committee is responsible for proposing 
candidates for appointment to the board having regard to the 
balance of skills, structure and composition of the board and 
ensuring the appointees have sufficient time available to devote 
to the role.as a result of the 
impairment review at the half-year, the group 
recognised an impairment charge for ndr 
of £27.4m.the committee requested 
third party advice to support its assessment of 
challenges by hmrc and the canadian revenue 
authority.the committee reviewed the tax charge at the half year and full year, 
including the underlying tax effect, deferred tax balances and the 
provision for uncertain tax positions for direct and indirect tax.the chairman also attends 
tax and treasury committee meetings which provides valuable insight 
into the tax matters, related provisions and helps establish the 
appropriateness of the recognition of the deferred tax balances.the committee is satisfied that all issues have been addressed appropriately and in accordance with the relevant accounting 
standards and principles.the company’s ceo, and finance 
director report to fellow board members matters raised by 
shareholders and analysts to ensure members of the board 
develop an understanding of investors’ and potential investors’ 
views of the company.the directors are committed to reducing 
the group’s absolute carbon emissions and managing its 
carbon footprint.in the event that a non-executive director is 
required to temporarily take on the role of an executive director, 
their remuneration may include any of the elements listed above 
for executive directors.the committee agreed 
that andrew rashbass had made an outstanding contribution on the organisation operating model resulting in a new group 
management board.the profit share scheme has no ceiling; the maximum annual variable 
element of remuneration was therefore calculated assuming that profits achieved had been 20% higher

the directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the group
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 57 of the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.the group has available-for-sale financial 
assets recognised at cost and is evaluating the impact of ifrs 9 
on this treatment.step acquisitions – control passes to the group
where a business combination is achieved in stages, at the 
stage at which control passes to the group, the previously held 
interest is treated as if it had been disposed of, along with the 
consideration paid for the controlling interest in the subsidiary.once classified as held for sale, the asset is held at the lower 
of its carrying value and the fair value less cost to sell and is no 
longer depreciated.the group’s loans and receivables comprise trade 
and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
statement of financial position.for hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or 
a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
income statement in the same period in which the hedged item 
affects the income statement.for 
cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the 
portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair 
value as determined at each balance sheet date.in respect of earnings, adjusted amounts reflect a 
tax rate that includes the current tax effect of the goodwill and 
intangible assets.further disclosures in accordance with ias 36 are provided where the group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a cgu 
that is significant, which the group considers to be 15% or more of the group’s total carrying value of goodwill.the acquisition commitments for reinsurance security (consultancy).co.uk limited is consideration contingent on the future profit 
and revenue of the business and are therefore re-measured at fair value through the profit and loss (note 25).the amounts 
and foreign exchange rates used in the covenant calculations are subject to adjustments as defined under the terms of the 
arrangement.euromoney institutional investor plc
