development costs for consistency with prior year and 
adequacy of the useful economic life; 
• comparing projects against which amounts are capitalised to 
the net present value calculations, produced by management, 
based on future income generation the technology will realise; 
• checking the mathematical accuracy of the impairment models;
• testing the accuracy of management’s estimates used in 
the net present value calculations by comparing the 2017 
budgeted sales and gross profit to the results achieved for 
the year and performing sensitivity analysis of expected 
revenue for 2018 onwards;
• evaluating the sensitivity of the discount rate applied 
to future cash flow;
• discussing and corroborating the ongoing viability of 
projects with relevant group personnel; and
• assessing management’s review of possible impairment 
of intangible assets and challenging the basis of key 
assumptions used.materiality for the current year is higher

an overview of the scope of our audit
our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group’s business, its environment 
and risk profile and in particular included:
• evaluation by the group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine 
the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality.our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.currently, software licence revenue is recognised at the point the software is delivered to 
the customer, hardware is recognised on dispatch to the customer, maintenance and services are recognised over the term of the

• the group had cash, net of debt of £6.6 million as at 31 december 2017.• the group has met the next repayment instalment of £0.75 million during january 2018 and no further capital repayments are 
due within the next 12 months.b. transactions and balances

at the dates of transactions.the codm and the rest of the board are provided with information on a divisional basis to assess the financial performance of, 
and allocate resources to, each division and central resources.goodwill
goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling 
interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.among other things, this requires that there is a market 
for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used 
in generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.translation reserve
exchange differences relating to the translation of the results and net assets of the group’s foreign operations from their functional 
currencies to the group’s presentation currency of gbp, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the translation reserve.the carrying value of trade receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
