the principal challenges in the risk environment faced by the group during the year include:
• the potential impact of the proposals on capital regulation from the bcbs
• execution and transitional risks arising from the recent major internal reorganisation 
• the impact of continuing uncertainty as to the terms on which the uk will leave the eu in march 2019
• the impact of fiscal changes on the demand for buy-to-let mortgages in the uk
• changes in the regulatory environment relating to the underwriting of buy-to-let mortgages 
• continuing transitional risks arising from the integration and expansion of the acquired asset finance business 
•  heightened cyber-security risks as a result of the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber-attacks affecting the financial services 
sector 
•  major regulatory developments including the implementation of the fourth money laundering directive and the impending implementation 
of the general data protection regulation (‘gdpr’)
the group continues to closely monitor its exposure to current and emerging risks as they develop and considers itself well placed to mitigate 
their impact.further details regarding the governance model, together with the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the group, the ways in which they 
are managed and mitigated and the extent to which these have changed in the year are detailed within section b6 of this annual report.at 30 september 2017 paragon bank held £615.0 million of balance sheet assets for liquidity purposes, in the form of central 
bank deposits (note 30).the group has invested not only in 
management training to ensure managers are equipped to support fair working practices, but also in educating all employees to ensure the 
policy is fully embedded.page 47  •  strategic report paragon banking group plc  •  2017 annual report and accounts
composition of the workforce
during the year the workforce has grown by 1.46% to 1,318 people (2016: 1,299).employees’ involvement
the directors recognise the benefit of keeping employees informed of the progress of the business.they are also responsible for ensuring any changes in the law are noted and applied to the group’s policies and procedures, where appropriate.at each meeting of the board and its committees actual or potential conflicts of interest in respect of any director are reviewed.during the year ended 30 september 2017 meetings were held with investors from the uk, europe and 
north america.in order to satisfy itself that this calculation resulted in appropriate provisioning, the committee 
considered actual out-turns against historical impairment provision amounts calculated by the 
group’s models and the continued relevance of historical cash flow experience to the current loan 
book, based on present economic conditions and account administration practices.the committee considers the independence of the external auditor annually and the group has a formal policy for the 
engagement of its external auditor to supply non-audit services, reviewed, most recently, in 2016. the policy is designed to ensure that neither 
the nature of the service to be provided nor the level of reliance placed on the services could impact the objectivity of the external auditor’s 
opinion on the group’s financial statements.the internal audit director met regularly throughout the year with the chairman of the committee to discuss progress against plan, outstanding 
agreed actions, and departmental resourcing.the results of this work, together with the committee’s engagement with the management information of the group and the executive 
directors, have enabled them to conclude that the statements given in section b3 relating to the group’s systems of internal control and its 
management of risk are appropriate.it has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the large and 
medium-sized companies and groups (accounts and reports) (amendment) regulations 2008, as amended in august 2013, and the principles 
of the uk corporate governance code.i should like to express my sincere thanks to my predecessor as chairman of the committee, alan fletcher, for 
his tireless efforts in chairing the committee, and for developing paragon’s remuneration policy over a period 
of significant change for both the business and for remuneration reporting, since his appointment in 2011.  
business performance
the year saw the completion of the group’s strategic reorganisation with most of the group’s activities 
moving under its banking subsidiary, which involved a significant amount of management time.1m £1,853.4m

full disclosure of the threshold and maximum ranges will be provided for the bonus earned for the year ended 30 september 2017 in the 
annual report on remuneration for the year ending 30 september 2018 which will be when it is anticipated that this information is no longer 
considered commercially sensitive.neither the chairman nor the non-executive directors 
are eligible to participate in any of the company’s incentive or pension schemes and they are not entitled to receive compensation for early 
termination of their terms of engagement.the committee considers key operational risk information such as loss events, emerging risks and control failures.this has been illustrated in recent years 
through acquisitions and diversification into new product areas.rental income and costs under operating leases are credited or charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period 
of the leases.the expected financing cost of the deficit, as estimated at the beginning of the period is recognised in the result for the period within interest 
payable.where the allowable cost of share based awards for tax purposes is greater than the cost determined in accordance with ifrs 2, the tax effect 
of the excess is taken to reserves.(dd) segmental reporting
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described above for the group as a whole.the accuracy of the calculation would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements or other 
variances in the operation of the models or the assumptions used.the group has not reclassified any of its measurements during the year.the key assumptions in the models relate to estimates of future cash flows from customers’ accounts, their timing and, for secured accounts, 
the expected proceeds from the realisation of the property or other charged assets.the group is subject to regulatory capital rules imposed by the pra on a consolidated basis as a group containing an authorised bank.this causes less disruption to the 
tenants and may result in the mortgage account returning to performing status and the property being handed back to the customer.the cash outflows, including principal and estimated interest, contractually required by the group’s retail deposit balances analysed by the 
earliest date at which repayment can be demanded are set out below:
2017 2016
£m £m
payable in less than one year or on demand 2,259.1 1,036.8
payable in one to two years 795.5 596.0
payable	in	two	t o	fiv e	years 687.4 312.9
3,742.0 1,945.7
in order to reduce the liquidity risk inherent in the group’s retail deposit balances, the pra requires that the bank, like other regulated banks, 
maintains a buffer of liquid assets to ensure it has sufficient available funds at all times to protect against unforeseen circumstances.this matching of the maturities of the assets and the 
related funding substantially reduces the group’s exposure to liquidity risk.further information about the remuneration of individual directors is provided in the 
annual remuneration report in section b5.2.2.the movement in the present value of the plan liabilities during the year was as follows:

unit method.
