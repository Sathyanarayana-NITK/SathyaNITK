key strengths
the directors believe that the group is well-placed to
compete against other market participants in the stem cell
and cord blood banking and services sector due to the
collectively strong track record, understanding and
experience of its board.however, the directors believe that the
integration of the widecells business with the cellplan
business, including the association with best doctors and
with high-quality service providers through cellplan excel,
will enable the widecells business to be competitive with
other stem cell storage and processing ﬁrms, particularly
as the group expands into broader stem cell banking
services such as in relation to dental pulp and adipose
tissue.the group does not actively engage in the

effectiveness of the system of internal control and report
to the board when appropriate with recommendations.it was concluded,
given the current size and transparency of the operations of
the group that an internal audit function was not required
however this remains a matter for ongoing review.the main features of the internal control system are
outlined below;
• a control environment exists through the close
management of the business by the executive
directors.governance –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 33
• standard ﬁnancial control procedures are operated
throughout the group to ensure that the assets of
the group are safeguarded and that proper
accounting records are maintained.should the

report and interim statements setting out details of the
group’s activities.employees
widecells group recognises the essential importance of
employees to the success of the business and ensures that
they are fully informed of events that directly affect them
and their working conditions.directors’ statement as to the
disclosure of information to
auditors
all of the current directors have taken all the steps that they
ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any
information needed by the group’s auditors for the purposes
of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of
that information.the ﬁnancial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and international financial reporting
standards (ifrss) as adopted by the european union and, as
regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as
applied in accordance with the provisions of the
companies act 2006.
in our opinion the ﬁnancial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 december 2017 and of the group’s loss for the
year then ended;
• the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by
the european union;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with ifrss as
adopted by the european union and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the companies
act 2006; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the companies
act 2006; and, as regards the group ﬁnancial
statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.we
have performed the following work as part of our audit:
independent auditor’s
report to the members of
widecells group plc financial statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 39
• we critically challenged the directors’ forecasts to
assess the group and parent company’s ability to
meet their ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due for
a period of at least 12 months from the date of
approval of the ﬁnancial statements and assessed
and corroborated the key underlying assumptions,
including:
• assessing the reasonableness of forecast
expenditure by reference to actual expenditures in
2017 and the director’s planned activity.the materiality for the audit of the widecells group plc
individual ﬁnancial statements was set at £67,500 (2016:
£15,000).these components account for 98% of the group’s revenue
and 86% of the group’s loss before tax.we have nothing to report in
this regard.in preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible
for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.use of our report
this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies
act 2006. our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.exchange diﬀerences arising on the retranslation of
unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss, except for foreign currency
borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange diﬀerences are
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve along with the exchange
diﬀerences arising on the retranslation of the foreign operation.such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest rate method, which
ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the
consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position.lease payments are analysed
between capital and interest.financial statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 51 2. critical accounting estimates and judgements
the group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.given the levels of materiality, the group does not
hedge its net investments in overseas operations as the cost of doing so is disproportionate to the exposure.
