we have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the 
isas (u k) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the strategic report set out on pages 23 to 24 that describe the principal risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation, set out on page 56 of the d irectors’ report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 56 of the d irectors’ report about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the 
directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the group and the parent c ompany’s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement relating to going concern required under the l isting rules in accordance with 
l isting rule 9.8.6r(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• the directors’ explanation, set out on page 56 of the d irectors’ report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.in this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following 
items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where 
we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:

the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• audit c ommittee reporting set out on pages 32 and 33 – the section describing the work of the audit c ommittee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit c ommittee; or
• directors’ statement of compliance with the u k c orporate governance c ode set out on page 28 – the parts of

an intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the group 
and that its cost can be measured reliably.where an impairment indicator is identified an impairment test is carried out by comparing the 
carrying of the assets with its recoverable amount.deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using 
the liability method.deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which 
the liability is settled or the asset recognised based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.4 critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
t he preparation of financial statements under ifrs requires the group to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts.however part of the interest rate risk was mitigated 
as £6.7m is subject to an interest rate swap, effectively fixing the l ibo r at 0.7675% and the interest rate paid at 
approximately 2.5% for this part of the loan.
