learning community across halma.in changing the hite name from 
meaning the halma innovation

nomination committee report
role of the committee
the committee is appointed by the 
board and operates under written 
terms of reference, which are available 
on the group’s website.the board has assessed the viability of the company over a three-year 
period, taking into account the group’s current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks and uncertainties.in drawing its 
conclusion, the board has aligned the period of viability assessment with 
the group’s strategic planning process (a three-year period).whistleblowing
the committee has responsibility for 
ensuring that arrangements are in 
place for employees to raise concerns 
or suspicions they may have about 
possible wrongdoing in financial 
reporting or other matters.confidential reports from this service 
are provided to the company 
secretary for investigation and to 
report any significant cases to the 
committee.under the 
direction of carole cran, the following 
process was carried out on behalf of 
the committee:
 — a desktop review of external audit 
providers to the ftse 100 was 
carried out (the ftse 100 was 
considered to be the most suitable 
benchmark given the global reach, 
market capitalisation and growth 
potential of halma).the committee undertook a significant 
review of the remuneration policy in 
2015 leading to a new policy receiving 
the support of 98% of shareholders at 
our 2015 agm.potential reward opportunities are based on halma’s remuneration policy, applied to salaries as at 1 april 2017. in the 
case of the chief executive, finance director and other executive directors this assumes a performance share award 
level of 200%, 175% and 150% of salary respectively (which is the basis on which the policy will be applied in 2017/18).nbs reports directly to the committee chairman and is a signatory to the code of conduct for remuneration

the accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 60 based on service to the end 
of the year.transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using crest and the directors can refuse to register a transfer 
of an uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations governing the operation of crest.auditor
each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this annual report and accounts confirms that:
 — so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and 
 — the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.materiality
the materiality that we used in the current year was £7.5 million which was determined on the basis of 5% of statutory 
profit before taxation.our assessment of risks of material misstatement
the assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets is a key risk 
due to the quantum of the balance and 
the judgements involved in setting the 
key assumptions and assertions used by 
management to support their assessment 
of the carrying value.at the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.key sources of estimation uncertainty 
contingent consideration 
determining the value of contingent consideration recognised as part of the acquisition of subsidiaries requires 
assumptions to determine the expected performance of the acquired business and the amount of contingent consideration 
that will therefore become payable.the principal annual rates used for this purpose are: 
leases 
the costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.for defined benefit plans, the 
asset or liability recorded in the company balance sheet is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and 
the present value of the defined obligation at that date.
