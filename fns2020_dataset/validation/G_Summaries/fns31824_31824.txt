not required to comply with the code, however,

time, and continuing thereafter, governance has 
always been considered important to the control 
and management of the business.in the 12 months leading up 
to the company’s ipo, the executive directors 
conducted a considerable number of meetings 
and presentations with institutional investors and

and potential shareholders will continue.the

major shareholders and commits to providing an 
accessible professional approach and provision 
of timely and accurate data in its interactions 
with its shareholders.following enquiry into, and discussion of 
management’s processes in this regard along with consideration of the draft annual report and 
accounts, the audit and risk committee  recommended to the board that it could make the required

our approach to remuneration
as set out more in depth in the proposed 
remuneration policy, the remuneration 
committee’s approach to remuneration is based 
upon offering a competitive, but not excessive, 
reward package for executive directors that 
aligns their pay with the strategy of the group.in the context of the above, the remuneration 
committee has sought to implement a 
remuneration policy that equips the group to 
retain and, where necessary, recruit the calibre 
of executive directors necessary to support its 
ambitious long-term strategy.irrespective of the achievement of the strategic and/or personal targets, 
no part of the bonus shall be payable unless a threshold level of the 
ebitda-based target is achieved.the remuneration committee is of the opinion that, given the 
commercial sensitivity of the detailed performance measures used for 
the annual bonus plan, disclosing precise targets in advance would not 
generally be in the interests of the group or its shareholders.the remuneration committee  is of the opinion that, given the commercial 
sensitivity of the detailed performance measures used for the psp, 
disclosing precise targets for those conditions would often not be in the 
interests of the group or its shareholders.4. statement of consideration of 
shareholders’ views
the remuneration committee  actively welcomes 
the input of shareholders in respect of its 
remuneration policies and decisions and is 
committed to engaging in an open and 
transparent dialogue with shareholders in 
relation to executive remuneration.annual report and accounts 2017

the maximum level of annual variable pay, which may be awarded to a new executive director, will 
be in line with the maximum amounts specified in the annual bonus plan and psp, as set out in the 
above, being a total of 225 % of salary.if an event occurs which means, in the opinion 
of the remuneration committee, that the 
performance conditions or associated targets 
are no longer an appropriate measure of the 
performance of the group’s business or its 
adherence to strategy then, in exceptional 
circumstances, the remuneration committee  
shall have the discretion to adjust, supplement 
or amend any performance condition or target, 
subject always that the adjusted, supplemental 
or amended performance condition must be not 
materially less difficult to satisfy.annual report and accounts 2017

30 january 2017 and remained an employee

decided that, given the commercial sensitivity 
of the detailed performance measures used for
