sonae modelo continente
i’m delighted that we are 
extending our deep group-
wide partnership with hilton 
to bring new manufacturing 
investment and capability to 
poland.its potential impact the group is reliant on its suppliers to provide sufficient volume of products, to 
the agreed specifications, in the very short lead times required by its customers, 
with efficient supply chain management being a key business attribute.its potential impact such incidents could result in systems or manufacturing process stoppages with 
consequent disruption and loss of efficiency which could impact the group’s sales.description of risk the group’s it systems could be subject to cyber attacks including fraudulent 
external email activity.we monitor and review all incidents and 
accidents in the workplace so that we can 
take appropriate action to improve working 
conditions whilst remaining focused on 
reducing both the absolute number of 
accidents and the number of serious 
accidents.in the uk the group follows the better 
payment practice code which requires a 
company to agree the terms of payment 
with its suppliers, to ensure its suppliers 
are aware of those terms and to abide by 
them.as an international group of 
companies we are fully aware of the 
broad spread of our responsibilities in all 
the countries in which we operate from 
protecting the environment to safeguarding 
the health and safety of our employees, 
respecting human rights, ensuring honesty, 
integrity and fairness in all our business 
dealings and operating our businesses  
in a safe and responsible manner.the group has also implemented an  
anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy  
to comply with the bribery act 2010.
modern slavery
we aim to ensure that the way we run  
our business prevents and deters any form 
of modern slavery and human trafficking 
from occurring anywhere in our business 
and supply chain.– the directors have general powers to 
manage the business and affairs of the 
company.directors’ statement as to disclosure 
of information to auditors
the directors who were members of 
the board at the time of approving the 
directors’ report are listed on pages 32 
and 33. having made enquiries of fellow 
directors and the company’s auditors, 
each of these directors confirm that:
 – to the best of each director’s knowledge 
and belief, there is no information 
relevant to the audit of which the 
company’s auditors are unaware; and
 – each director has taken all the steps a 
director might reasonably be expected 
to have taken to be aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.with the exception 
of the non-executive chairman, who 
is presumed under the code not to be 
independent following his appointment, 
the board considers the non-executive 
directors to be independent.during the current financial 
year the group were not advised of, nor 
did the group identify, any such conflicts 
of interest.the committee meets 
at least six times per year and seeks to 
focus and co-ordinate risk management 
activities throughout the group in order 
to facilitate the identification, evaluation 
and management of key business 
risks.the committee considered the expected 
impact of new ifrs standards in relation 
to ifrs 9 financial instruments and 
ifrs 15 revenue recognition which 
are effective from 1 january 2018 and 
was satisfied with the assessment that 
there is no material change ahead of their 
implementation next year.on behalf of the nomination committee

governance
directors’ remuneration report consequently during 2018 the 
remuneration committee will pay close 
attention to any reforms implemented by 
the government in the coming months 
and will also review our general approach 
following publication of the revised 
corporate governance code which is 
expected later this year.the payment may be in the form of 
additional shares or cash and may assume reinvestment.however, employee remuneration policies are based on the 
same broad principles and the remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees as a whole.for good leavers, outstanding share awards may vest at the original vesting date, or on the date of 
cessation if the committee decides, subject to time pro-rating and the performance conditions being satisfied.consideration 
of employment 
conditions elsewhere 
in the group
the committee takes into account the general employment reward packages of employees across the group 
when setting policy for executive director remuneration and is kept informed of changes in pay across the 
group.legacy arrangements
for the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the company to honour any commitments entered 
into with current or former directors (such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes) that have been 
disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.the directors’ remuneration policy 
is subject to a binding resolution every 
three years or sooner where any changes 
are made.in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in this 
information (ca06).directors’ remuneration
in our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
companies act 2006 (ca06).the registered number of the company is 06165540.
the company maintains a premium listing on the london stock exchange.the reasons why the directors consider  
this basis to be appropriate are set out in the performance and financial review on page 20.
the financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when 
otherwise indicated.(c) group companies
the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have  
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 – assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 – income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
 – all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and disclosed as a separate component 
of equity in a foreign currency translation reserve.the merger and reverse acquisition reserves arose during 2007 following the restructuring of the group.borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.to the extent there is 
no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity 
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.the fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding adjustment to equity.details on the fair valuation being disclosed in note 17.
during 2017 and 2016 there were no critical other accounting estimates or judgements in relation to the application of the group’s 
accounting policies.
