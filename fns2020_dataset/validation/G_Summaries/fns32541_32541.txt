the independence, effectiveness and 
commitment of each of the non-executive 
directors has been reviewed by the committee

time commitment of all the non-executive 
directors during the year.i have 
thoroughly enjoyed my time at landsec, and

and nicholas cadbury also met separately 
with cbre.a fixed-fee arrangement (subject to

work, we have disclosed the fees paid to them 
in note 9 to the financial statements.in addition, the committee considered, took 
action and made onward recommendations to 
the board, as appropriate, in respect of other 
key matters including the viability statement,

back and new issue, maintenance of the group’s 
reit status and other specific areas of individual

the appropriate yield (based on recent market 
evidence), changes to market rents (ervs), what 
will occur at the end of each lease, the level 
of non-recoverable costs and alternative uses.other disclosures

directors’ 
remuneration 
report – 
chairman’s 
annual 
statement
dear shareholder,
i am pleased to introduce the directors’ 
remuneration report for the year.the political and economic uncertainty 
to which i alluded last year has certainly 
accelerated in some unexpected ways, 
beginning with the uk’s decision to leave the 
european union.4.2 — the outturn is calculated on the basis of a threshold of £65m.5.2
people – ensuring that the office move to victoria was 
maximised as an opportunity to embed the purpose, 
vision and values and create a step change in a more 
collaborative and innovative culture, to be measured 
through movement in “before” and “after” employee 
surveys versus a recognised external benchmark.accordingly, the 10,495,131 
ordinary shares held in treasury at 31 march 2017 
remained unchanged from those held at the 
beginning of the year.information provided to 
the company under the dtr is publicly available 
to view via the regulatory information service on 
the company’s website.there are no special control 
rights attaching to them save that the control 
rights of ordinary shares held in the ebt can 
be directed by the company to satisfy the 
vesting of outstanding awards under its various 
employee share plans.subject to the above, the trustee  
may take such action with respect to the offer 
as it thinks fit.the rights, including full details relating to voting 
of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer 
relating to the company’s ordinary shares, are 
set out in the articles and in the explanatory 
notes that accompany the notice of the 2017 
agm.further information regarding the 
company’s practical safeguarding of human 
rights and promotion of equal opportunities 
is included as part of the social review in the 
strategic report on page 38. 
political donations 
no political donations were made in the year 
(2015/16: nil).auditor and disclosure of information to  
the auditor 
so far as the directors are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information that has not been 
brought to the attention of the company’s 
auditor.compared to the prior year, there have been no changes to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement.the group is in the process of assessing the impact of ifrs 9, but adoption of the new 
standard may impact the measurement and presentation of the group’s financial liabilities.adjusted net assets excludes the fair value of interest-rate swaps used for hedging purposes and the bond exchange de-recognition adjustment.group

other unrecognised temporary differences 140 –

the other unrecognised temporary differences relate to the premium paid on the redemption of the group’s medium term notes.if, in subsequent 
periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its carrying value, the impairment is reversed to 
align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value.the group purchased £3m of its a3 mtn due in 2022,  
£7m of its a10 mtn due in 2025, £20m of its a4 mtn due in 2026, £23m of its a5 mtn due in 2027 and £2m of its a7 mtn due in 2032. the table below 
summarises the aggregate purchases, together with the premiums paid.the group’s overall risk 
management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the group’s financial performance and includes the use of derivative 
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.in line with 
the policy approved by the board of directors, where the group manages the deposit only independently rated banks and financial institutions with a 
minimum rating of a- are accepted.the fair value of the redemption liability is determined as the present value of the amount the group would be required to pay to settle the liability (an 
exit price).defined benefit scheme
the pension & assurance scheme of the land securities group of companies (the scheme) is a registered defined benefit final salary scheme subject  
to the uk regulatory framework for pensions, including the scheme specific funding requirements.the weighted average share price at the date of vesting during 
the year was 1,006p (2016: 1,262p).the table below summarises the apms included in these annual results, where the definitions and reconciliations of these measures can be found,
