very characteristics that can lead to plastics 
being a problem for the environment can 
also be applied to solve key environmental 
challenges, such as the management of 
water, or the management of various 
attributes of climate.furthermore, polypipe 
works with industry leading partners 
such as veolia to source quality recyclable 
bales of plastic bottles and containers.not only is the polymer material 
recyclable at the end of its product 
life, which is designed to be at least 50 
years, the benefits of plastic make it a 
much more considerate choice for the 
environment versus alternative materials.in addition, the light weight attribute of 
plastics means that plastic pipes can be 
70% cheaper to transport than equivalent 
size concrete pipes and can be handled 
and stored much more safely on-site.with the room being completely round, 
it was impossible to locate radiators to fit the curve of the wall.in addition, the principal risks listed below do not comprise all of the 
risks that the group may face and they are not listed in order of priority, probability or magnitude of potential impact.the group contracts with several third party providers
