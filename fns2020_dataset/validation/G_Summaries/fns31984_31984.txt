we continue to operate in an increasingly regulated environment and we have again strengthened our legal, risk and 
compliance departments by additional recruitment over the last financial year .as disclosed more fully in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the partners of north row capital llp, in which 
the group held a 60% interest, decided to terminate the fund resulting in an impairment loss of £0 .the committee met on six occasions during the year and is wholly responsible for determining the 
remuneration of the chief executive and senior risk and compliance staff .the group established an employee benefit trust (“ebt”) on 3 december 2010 in order to acquire ordinary shares in the 
company in connection with the deferred share element of the profit related bonus under the ltis as detailed above .the scheme is a discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the company’s 
shares in the future at a price set on the date of the grant .as a result of 
feedback and in recognition of the ongoing industry debate, the committee resolved to introduce changes to the annual 
bonus arrangements with effect for the 2017/18 financial year and, during the course of that year, to review further the 
arrangements for an equity based long-term incentive scheme to replace the current long term incentive scheme .the overriding objectives remain for the policy to be linked to the group’s strategy, aligned with shareholders’ interests with 
significant long term equity participation with both annual and long term elements and to be compliant with the relevant fca 
regulations and other guidance .the group maintains separate, 
independent risk and compliance departments, which 
ensures conformity with the regulations of its key regulators, 
as well as relevant statutes, in all of our dealings with 
our clients .the group considers that regular 
training is extremely important .under the terms of the pensions act 
2008, on commencing employment 
all eligible employees are 
‘auto-enrolled’ into the group 
pension scheme .report of the directors

given current market and industry trends .a pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been used, 
based on the group’s assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks relating to brooks macdonald international .the key assumptions inherent in the value-in-use calculations for the braemar cgu were a pre-tax discount rate of 11%, 
annual revenue growth rates ranging from 10% to 28% and a long-term growth rate of 2% .the table below provides an analysis of the financial instruments that, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair
