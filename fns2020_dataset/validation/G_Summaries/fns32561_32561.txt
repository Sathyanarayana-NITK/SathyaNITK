for executives, our approach continues 
to be designed so as to:
• align with the business strategy and 
the achievement of planned business 
goals;
• support the creation of sustainable 
long–term shareholder value;
• provide an appropriate balance 
between remuneration elements  
that attract, retain and motivate the 
highest calibre of executive talent; and
• encourage a high–performance 
culture by ensuring performance–
related remuneration constitutes a 
substantial proportion of the 
remuneration package and by linking 
maximum payout opportunity to 
outstanding results.• if cash is taken, the amount  
is reduced by the value of 
the employer’s national 
insurance liability.executive directors – potential value of 2017/18 package
performance measures
with the exception of base salary, 
benefits, pension and participation  
in the sharesave scheme, all other 
elements of the remuneration packages 
of the executive directors are linked  
to performance.annual incentive scheme
the annual incentive scheme has been 
designed to incentivise outstanding 
performance across a number of key 
stakeholder measures and it rewards 
approximately 90 executives with  
both a cash payment and an award of 
deferred shares.the strategic individual objectives will  
be quantitative measures linked to 
individual responsibilities in the context 
of our strategic objectives, and will be 
reviewed in advance by the committee.annual incentive scheme
if a director leaves the company for a 
‘permitted reason’ under the rules of the 
scheme (or if the committee decides to 
apply ‘good leaver’ status in accordance 
with the discretion outlined on page 86 
of this report), the default position 
would be that deferred shares would 
vest on the date of leaving and a  
pro–rated cash award would be made 
for the incentive year.non-executive directors have 
letters of appointment setting out their 
duties and the time commitment 
expected of them.the column showing awards not subject to performance conditions does not include the deferred shares issued 
under the incentive scheme in 2017.
please see tables below and on the following pages for details of ltip awards, deferred shares and sharesave options.the table below 
shows a summary of the personal strategic objectives for each of the executive directors, together with details on which of the 
three strategic priorities (see pages 8 to 13) each objective is linked to:

independent auditor’s report to the members  
of whitbread plc
opinion on financial statements 
of whitbread plc
in our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the group’s 
and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 2 march 2017 and of the group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting 
standards (ifrs) as adopted by 
the european union;
• the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with united 
kingdom generally accepted 
accounting practice involving frs 101 
‘reduced disclosure framework’;
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the companies 
act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, article 4 of 
the ias regulation.in addition, we also assessed one-off items identified through the course of the audit, 
but which had been recognised within underlying profit before tax; and
• for each of the items identified above: obtained and assessed management’s accounting papers 
and considered the judgements and assumptions used in these.in addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit.the group has adopted the following standards and interpretations which have been assessed as having no financial impact 
or disclosure requirements at this time:
• the iasb’s annual improvement process, 2012–2014;
• ias 1 disclosure initiative – amendments to ias 1;
• ias 16 and ias 38 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation – amendments to ias 16 and ias 38;
• ias 16 and ias 41 bearer plants – amendments to ias 16 and ias 41;
• ias 27 equity method in separate financial statements – amendments to ias 27;
• ifrs 10, ifrs 12 and ias 28 investment entities: applying the consolidation exception – amendments to ifrs 10, ifrs 12 
and ias 28; and
• ifrs 11 accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations – amendments to ifrs 11.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of whitbread plc and all its subsidiaries, together with 
the group’s share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associate incorporated using the equity method of 
accounting.the income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period.consolidated accounts 2016/17   whitbread annual report and accounts 2016/17 134

restructuring
restructuring provisions have been recognised as a result of the group’s decision to exit certain markets and restructure 
its operations.the issue of shares in lieu 
of cash dividends was treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share 
premium account.under the governing documentation of the whitbread group pension fund, any future surplus in the fund would be 
returnable to whitbread plc by a reduction in future contributions.in addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the pension scheme will receive a share of the 
income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in moorgate slp, which was established by the group 
in the year ended 4 march 2010 (the share in profits is accounted for by the group as contributions when paid).
