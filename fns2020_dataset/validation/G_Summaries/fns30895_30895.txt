making a difference  
in greener shipping 
transforming efficiency and 
operations – environmental 
compliance
monitoring ships’ energy consumption and 
emissions is required by law in many parts of the 
world.evidence of this is continued 
high utilisation of inmarsat’s unique l -band 
tactical satellite service (‘l -tac’) – a highly 
resilient communication service that 
market outlook
the growth of government and military 
satellite communications will be driven by 
internationalisation of demand beyond 
the established space-equipped nations, 
major events, budgetary stimulus, technology 
obsolescence and new opportunities emerging 
from a structural shift from government 
procurement of proprietary space infrastructure 
to the acquisition by governments of off-the-shelf 
services from commercial partners to replace 
or complement proprietary capabilities.over the medium term, we expect 
to transition a portion of these customers 
onto gx for aviation ifc services.as a result of the above, adjusted 
ebitda in 2017, decreased by $43.4m from 
the prior year, and adjusted ebitda margin 
decreased to 53.7%, from 59.8% in 2016.
operating profit
as noted above, the one-off costs associated 
with the headcount reduction programme reduced 
operating profit in 2017. in addition, depreciation 
and amortisation for 2017 increased by $57.3m

strategic report | chief financial officer’s review group balance sheet
the table opposite shows the condensed 
consolidated group balance sheet.› we continue to improve the reliability of our satellites 
and services which are critical to our end-users.we may not be able to coordinate usage in the future  
and/or may be charged for the spectrum which could 
affect our ability to provide services.we work with organisations such 
as the itu, and participate in conferences such as the 
world radio conference to brief them on the ongoing 
need for our frequency allocations.› we develop and implement a people strategy where we identify 
key employees, skills and skills gaps to manage the human 
resource effectively and enable delivery of the strategy of the 
company.despite this reclassification 
of sir bryan’s non-executive directorship, he 
fulfils his responsibilities with an independent 
view, providing critical thinking and contributions 
and continues to act in the best interests of the 
company.he is responsible for:
 › the day-to-day management of inmarsat’s 
operations and its financial results
 › recommending the strategic objectives 
for the inmarsat group, for debate, 
challenge and approval by the board
 › responsibility for ensuring we meet the 
milestones for our key programmes with a 
priority to target revenue growth and deliver 
enhanced returns to shareholders and
 › chairing the executive management board

and social governance, community investment, 
and other corporate social responsibility matters, 
as well as responsibility for health and safety.› monitoring of controls: the audit committee 
receives regular reports from the internal 
and external auditors and assures itself that 
the internal control environment of the group 
is operating effectively.management 
continues to focus on how internal control and 
risk management can be further embedded 
into the operations of the business and to 
deal with areas of improvement which come 
to management’s and the board’s attention.the company has an established disclosure 
committee with responsibility for reviewing 
and approving controls and procedures over 
the public disclosure of financial and related 
information and other procedures necessary 
to enable the chief executive officer and 
the chief financial officer to provide their 
certifications in relation to publicly disclosed 
information.the committee also makes recommendations 
to the board on the composition of the 
board’s committees and will review and make 
recommendations in relation to the structure, 
size and composition of the board including 
the diversity and balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience, and the independence of 
the non-executive directors, including the 
tenure of each director.appointment and 
reappointment
the directors may appoint additional 
members to join the board during the year.the committee comprised 
a majority of independent non-executive 
directors and meets as and when necessary, 
generally twice a year.this enabled the audit committee 
to review and clarify the completeness of 
financial reporting disclosures prior to their 
release by the board.the committee discussed these 
with the external auditor during the year and, 
where appropriate, details of how they have 
been addressed are provided in the independent 
auditors’ report on pages 105 to 111.

the data for other employees relates to the average pay across staff based in the uk, which is deemed to be the most appropriate employee group.the purpose of this report is to provide 
information to the company’s shareholders.due to the highly material nature of airtime revenue, the high volume of transactions and the inherent risk that manual postings  
are susceptible to manipulation, a significant risk, whether due to fraud or error, has been identified that if these postings are not 
accurate, complete or related to transactions which have occurred.inmarsat plc | annual report and accounts 2017 122 financial statements | consolidated financial statements 123 inmarsat plc | annual report and accounts 2017 financial statements | consolidated financial statements
