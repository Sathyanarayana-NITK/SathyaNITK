the aim rules for companies.under company law, when 
preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in 
accordance with an appropriate set of generally accepted

models to assess whether these were consistent with our

performance and the markets in which they operate.we also considered the changes to the 
overall group as a result of the acquisitions of cyberghost

business activities and transactions reside.the
