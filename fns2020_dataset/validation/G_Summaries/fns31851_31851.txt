given the recommended cash offer for 
the business from stonegate, it is likely that 
the ownership of the company will change 
in the next few weeks.during the year, we 
recruited two corporate sales managers 
to also develop this part of the market.results
the year-on-year growth in total revenue 
of +9.2 per cent and adjusted ebitda*** 
of +16.0 per cent reflects good progress 
despite the absorption of significant cost 
headwinds affecting the whole sector.the cumulative effect of the 
restatements was to reduce profit after 
tax for the period ended 2 july 2016 by 
£1.7 million, and to reduce net assets as 
at 2 july 2016 by £3.3 million.michael shallow independent non-executive director – appointment date: 16 february 2015

the board is appointed by shareholders, 
who are the owners of the group.the 
board’s principal responsibility is to act 
in the best interests of shareholders 
as a whole, within the legal framework 
of the companies act 2006. it is also 
collectively responsible to shareholders 
for the long-term success of the group.in the 
short term, the resultant actions have been 
largely reactive to ensure that reporting 
deadlines were met and that the company 
could respond appropriately to two 
approaches regarding possible offers for 
the group.this separation of responsibilities between 
the chairman and the chief executive officer, 
coupled with the schedule of reserved 
matters, ensures that no individual has 
unfettered powers of decision making.the chairman 
and the company secretary work 
together to ensure that board papers 
are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely 
manner to directors, and of sufficient 
quality to enable the board to discharge 
its duties.remuneration committee report

dear shareholder
i am pleased to present, on behalf 
of the board, the remuneration report 
of the remuneration committee.however, 
given the accounting matters that came 
to light shortly after mike foster’s interim 
appointment, culminating in the market 
announcement and given the approach 
from stonegate pub company limited 
(“stonegate”) to potentially make an 
offer for the group, we moved quickly 
to secure mike foster’s services on a 
permanent basis.the committee also ensures that 
an effective system of control and risk 
management is in place with regards to 
remuneration, which includes access to 
the audit committee to discuss matters of 
operational and financial risk.these include:
 > timing of awards and payments;
 > the size of an award (within the limits 
noted in the table above) and when 
and how much should vest;
 > who receives an award or payment;
 > dealing with a change of control or 
restructuring of the group;
 > determining whether a participant is 
a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes and whether and what 
proportion of awards vest;
 > any adjustments required to awards 
in certain circumstances (e.g.under the terms of the service 
agreement, mark mcquater is entitled 
to an annual car allowance of 10 per cent 
of his basic salary, permanent health 
insurance, private health insurance for 
himself, his spouse and his family, life 
insurance and a pension contribution 
of 15 per cent of basic salary, which was 
increased to 17.5 per cent effective at the 
beginning of the current reporting period.revolution bars group plc

the committee does not consult with employees directly on matters of executive remuneration.the chief executive officer is invited 
to attend meetings, although is not

own remuneration are discussed.the table above shows shareholdings as at both the start and end of the reporting period and the percentage of the guideline 
currently met as at 1 july 2017.
total shareholding, which counts towards the measurement of the guideline, is calculated on the basis of legally owned 
shares.in parallel, the new team was 
asked to review the application of all key 
accounting policies and practices and this 
identified several other issues also 
requiring adjustments to prior periods.election of directors
on the recommendation of the 
committee and in line with the code, 
all of the group’s directors will stand 
for election at the forthcoming agm 
and will subsequently offer themselves 
for re-election on an annual basis.jemima bird was appointed to the
