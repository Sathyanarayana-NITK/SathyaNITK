understandable, and also that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.as part of its review, the committee monitored the provision of non-audit services by kpmg audit

of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases.when the group exchanges with the existing lender one debt instrument into another one with substantially different terms, 
such exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial 
liability.depreciation of assets in the course of construction commences when 
the assets are ready for their intended use.in respect of equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included  
in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest 
rate.an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.defined benefit costs are 
categorised as follows:
 – service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements).the value recognised for equipment sales is the value of the cash received from the sale.it is expected that there will be a change in accounting for some contracts where the current accounting policy would be to 
recognise the sale and associated cost on a gross basis with the entity as principal in the arrangement.significant judgement is 
required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.the 
restructuring provision relates to employee termination benefits, consulting fees and other costs of the transformation 
programme.18(b) credit risk
credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group’s receivables due from customers and cash and cash equivalents.the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of 
each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the statement of financial position.fair value hierarchy
the table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to 
which the fair value is observable (as described in the accounting policy in note 1.4).the estimated fair value of the options granted was £2.035, and the aggregate of the estimated fair value of the 
options, which will be recognised over the vesting period was £128,000.the saye scheme contains provisions for 
‘good leavers’ as defined in the saye scheme, which enable ‘good leavers’ to exercise options under the savings contract at 
the date the participant ceases to hold employment with the group.the estimated fair value of the 
options granted was £0.387 per share.recruitment award
