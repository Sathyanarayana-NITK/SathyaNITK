on 19 april 2017 m stephen exercised 1,200,000 share options at the exercise price of 6.25 pence per share, the 
market value of these shares at exercise was 9.75 pence resulting in a gain of 3.5 pence per share.see note 18 to the annual report 
and accounts for the terms of the above options and warrants.the financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and united kingdom 
accounting standards (united kingdom generally 
accepted accounting practice), including financial 
reporting standard 102 “the financial reporting 
standard applicable in the uk and republic of ireland”.the level of materiality we set is based 
on our assessment of the magnitude of misstatements 
that, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to have influence on the economic decisions of 
the users of the financial statements.we agreed with the audit committee that we would 
report to that committee all identified corrected and 
uncorrected audit differences in excess of £4,000 for 
the group and in excess of £2,000 for the company 
(representing 3% of financial statement materiality) 
together with differences below that threshold that, in 
our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.based on that 
assessment, all entities within the group were subject to 
full scope audit and was performed by the group audit 
team at the group’s main offices in borehamwood.our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
in light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
group and the parent company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the strategic report 
or the directors’ report.we have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters in relation to which the companies act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•   adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
financial statements business review corporate governance symphony environmental technologies plc annual report & accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 18
•  the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; 
or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specific 
by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and international standards on auditing (uk).the company’s shares are listed on the aim 
market of the london stock exchange.revenue 
from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the 
following conditions have been satisfied:
a)  ownership of the significant risks and rewards has 
been transferred to the buyer.among other things, this requires 
that there is a market for the output from the 
intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, 
if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in 
generating such benefits;
•   there are adequate technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the development and to use  
or sell the intangible asset; and

and accounts

•   the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset 
during its development can be measured reliably.the recoverable amount is the 
higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions 
less costs to sell, and value in use based on an 
internal discounted cash flow evaluation.transactions in foreign currencies 
are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the date of the transaction.the group’s management have performed an 
impact assessment of the effects of ifrs 15 on the 2017

interest rate risk
the group seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk where possible, but this is offset by the availability of trade 
finance arrangements which are transaction specific to meet liquidity needs and so have variable interest rate terms.the group hedges the transactions where possible by buying goods and selling them in the same currency.a summary of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities as stated in the statement of financial position together 
with a sensitivity analysis showing the effect of a 10% change in rate with sterling is shown below:
