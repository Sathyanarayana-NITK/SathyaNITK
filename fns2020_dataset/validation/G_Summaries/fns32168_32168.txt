flybe subsequently entered into a contract in march 
2016 with nordic aviation capital (‘nac’), to cancel 
obligations to lease nine of the 24 used bombardier 
q400 turboprop aircraft it was committed to under 
the terms of the embraer and republic agreement, 
and in return to take ownership of 10 q400 aircraft it 
was under contract to lease, for a cash consideration 
of u sd131.8m (£103.0m).flybe faces trading risks presented by current 
economic conditions in the aviation sector, particularly 
in relation to passenger volumes and yields and the 
associated profitability of individual routes.based on this assessment, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the company and the 
group will be able to continue to operate, meet all their 
liabilities as they fall due and have a viable business 
model during the three-year period to march 2020.
in making this statement, the directors have also made 
the following key assumptions on the basis that it 
would not be meaningful to attempt to measure the 
impact of major events occurring in these areas:
 > funding for capital expenditure in the form of 
capital markets debt, bank debt, or aircraft leases 
will remain available;
 > t here will not be a prolonged grounding of the 
flybe fleet or a substantial proportion thereof; and
 > t here will neither be a significant change in 
government regulation nor significant problems 
arising from brexit.flybe’s policy for 
health and safety is defined in the health, safety 
and environment manual.exeter city’s football in the 
community charity team is used 
and endorsed by a wide range of 
civic and educational bodies to 
deliver social, health and fitness 
projects across the area.t he at r72-600 is the newest aircraft in the flybe fleet 
and is used for the swedish sas white l abel operation

of the business is included in the strategic report.the rights and obligations attaching to the c ompany’s 
ordinary shares are set out in the c ompany’s articles 
of association.in addition there were a number 
of ad hoc meetings of the board and the remuneration 
c ommittee to deal with the circumstances surrounding 
the resignation of saad hammad and the appointment 
of c hristine o urmieres-widener.all of the non-executive directors 
have, during the course of the year, received updates 
on best practice, as well as more formal training 
sessions on directors’ duties, disclosure obligations 
and share dealing compliance, as well as bringing 
knowledge and information gathered from their other 
business interests.responsibilities
the responsibilities of the audit c ommittee, further 
details of which can be found in its terms of reference 
at www.flybe.com/corporate/governance include 
monitoring and reviewing:
 > the integrity of the group’s financial statements 
and any formal announcements relating to flybe’s 
performance;
 > management’s response to any major external or 
internal audit recommendations;
 > the effectiveness of the group’s internal financial 
and operational controls and risk management 
systems;
 > the effectiveness of the external audit process 
including their independence, objectivity and cost – 
see auditor independence on page 78;

 > policy on the engagement of the external auditor to 
supply non-audit services;
 > key areas of risk management to support the 
board’s role in overseeing an enterprise-wide 
approach to risk identification, management and 
mitigation; and
 > the effectiveness of communication between the 
external auditor and both the audit c ommittee and 
the group’s financial and senior management.the audit c ommittee agrees the 
scope of the external audit work and discusses the 
results of the half-year review and the full-year audit 
with the external auditor, the c hief financial o fficer 
and c hief executive o fficer.the committee is satisfied that the judgements made 
by management are reasonable, and that appropriate 
disclosures have been included in the accounts.with the risk profile of 
flybe and the limited number of qualified resources, 
it seemed an opportune point to proceed with this 
strategy.directors’ remuneration continued

bonus which lapses if circumstances occur which would warrant 
the company summarily dismissing the e xecutive for misconduct 
(whether or not the c ompany has chosen to do so).therefore, when calculating how many shares were actually 
awarded, the c ommittee used the 89.5p share price used for the 2015 awards as opposed to the average share price of the last three dealing 
days prior to grant, thereby resulting in an award over fewer shares.given the competitive nature of the c ompany’s sector, 
the specific performance targets are considered to 
be commercially sensitive and accordingly are not

c ommittee may lapse part/all of any unvested psp 
award and/or any shares that are the subject of a post-

that the event is not to the benefit or detriment

letter, the resolution approving the annual report on 
remuneration was passed with a substantial majority 
at the 2016 agm.our audit work was 
completed by the group audit team and comprised 
a full scope audit on both uk components where the 
extent of our testing was based on our assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality 
of the group’s operations in that component being: 
flybe l imited £1.81m (fy16: £1.50m) and flybe aviation 
services l imited £0.63m (fy16: £0.84m).scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
an audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.avios purchases the 
flights from flybe on behalf of its customers and 
these are included in the deferred income and once 
transportation has been provided, in the income 
statement revenues.disposals of property, plant, equipment 
and intangible assets
t he gain or loss on disposal of property, plant, 
equipment and intangible assets after deducting 
any costs associated with selling, disposing of or 
retiring the relevant asset is recognised in the income 
statement and reported under other operating gains 
or losses.cash flow hedges
c hanges in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and are effective as 
hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income and any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item.
