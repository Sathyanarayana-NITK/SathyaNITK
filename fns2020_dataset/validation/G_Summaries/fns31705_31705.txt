the total dividend 
for the year of £2.4m is based on 
a dividend cover of 3.0 times the 
group’s profit after tax, adjusted for 
exceptional items, which is in line 
with our guidance on dividend cover 
stated at the time of the ipo.tamdown operates within the 
more economically resilient areas 
of the south east of england and 
london where the undersupply of 
housing appears to be more acute 
compared to the rest of the uk.this is in line with our 
guidance at the time of the ipo.nexus infrastructure plc | annual report and financial statements 2017
