table	below	were	settled	in	cash,	no	amounts	were	deferred.the	performance	
period	for	these	awards	is	three	years	from	the	date	of	grant	although	there	is	then	a	further	deferral/holding	period.electronic copies of the annual report and financial

notice	of	annual	general	meeting,	other	corporate	publications,	
press	releases	and	announcements	are	available	on	the	group’s	
website	at	capreg.com.we	confirm	that:
•	 we	have	concluded	that	the	directors’	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	in	the	preparation	of	the	financial	statements	
is	appropriate;	and
•	 we	have	not	identified	any	material	uncertainties	that	may	cast	significant	doubt	on	the	group’s	ability	to	continue	as	a	going	
concern.•	 we	audited	the	basis	of	accounting	for	the	acquisition,	including	the	
calculation	of	the	goodwill	arising	on	acquisition.we	have	agreed	the	
required	internal	rate	of	return	for	the	recognition	of	a	performance	
fee	for	each	management	contract	to	the	underlying	agreement	
and	compared	it	against	the	current	forecast	investment	return	
based	on	the	property	valuations	at	30	december	2014	and	
forecast	value	movements.the	nature	of	the	group’s	operations	and	its	
principal	activities	are	disclosed	in	note	2a	and	in	the	operating	and	financial	reviews.fair	value	for	measurement	and/or	disclosure	purposes	in	these	financial	statements	is	determined	on	such	basis,	except	for	share	
based	payments	that	are	within	the	scope	of	ifrs	2,	leasing	transactions	that	are	within	the	scope	of	ias	17,	and	measurements	
that	have	some	similarities	to	fair	value	but	are	not	fair	value,	such	as	net	realisable	value	in	ias	2	or	value	in	use	in	ias	36.
in	addition,	for	financial	reporting	purposes,	fair	value	measurements	are	categorised	into	level	1,	2	or	3	based	on	the	degree	to	
which	the	inputs	to	the	fair	value	measurements	are	observable	and	the	significance	of	the	inputs	to	the	fair	value	measurement	in	
its	entirety,	which	are	described	as	follows:
•	 level	1	inputs	are	quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities
•	 level	2	inputs	are	inputs	other	than	quoted	prices	included	within	level	1,	that	are	observable	for	the	asset	or	liability,	either	
directly	(i.e.the	corresponding	rent	liability	to	the	leaseholder	is	included	in	the	balance	sheet	
as	a	finance	lease	obligation.the	fair	value	of	interest	rate	swaps	is	calculated	by	reference	to	appropriate	
forecasts	of	yield	curves	between	the	balance	sheet	date	and	the	maturity	of	the	instrument.changes	in	fair	value	are	included	
as	finance	income	or	finance	costs	in	the	income	statement,	except	for	gains	or	losses	on	the	portion	of	an	instrument	that	is	an	
effective	hedge	of	the	net	investment	in	a	foreign	operation,	which	are	recognised	in	the	net	investment	hedging	reserve.23714.04    15 april 2015 10:01 am      proof 5
