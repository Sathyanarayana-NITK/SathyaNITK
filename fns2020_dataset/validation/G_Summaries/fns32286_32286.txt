i should also like to take this opportunity to thank the members 
of the service improvement panel, the resident inspector team 
and the complaints review panel for their hard work and vital 
contribution throughout the year to governance, scrutiny, 
engagement and to driving further improvements.because the board is not 
involved in the day-to-day 
operations, we can focus on 
always looking a little further 
into the future.”

co-opted member of the 
board and chair of the 
development committee  
and bushmead homes
paul brings us over 36 years’ 
experience in residential 
development and property 
management, the majority of which 
has been in the housing association 
sector.during the year to 31 
march 2017, 2,520 properties were resurveyed to keep our stock 
condition data up to date.23 report and financial statements 2017
financial statements additional information governance strategic report value for money
we have a value for money (vfm) strategy which sets out the 
framework of how efficiencies and savings are generated and how 
the delivery of ‘value’ is measured.the board has concluded that we have been successful in delivering 
vfm, having continued to maintain tight control of operational costs, 
invest in improvements to service delivery and existing stock, deliver 
new homes and restructure our funding at lower cost.we explored 
a number of options for redeveloping the site including selling the site in its existing state, and concluded that we would generate the 
most value by converting pilgrims house into apartments for sale.during 2016/17, we redefined our core operating area 
to encompass 11 local authorities across the oxford 
to cambridge arc, and withdrew from seeking new 
development opportunities in south oxfordshire and the 
vale of white horse.bpha 
limited acts only as landlord and holds 
no equity interest
bushmead homes limited develops 
properties for outright sale
bpha limited (via bushmead homes 
limited) has a 25% interest in gog
magog partnership llp, whose principal 
activity is the development of residential 
accommodation for private sale and of 
affordable residential accommodation
for sale to registered providers
hca continues to rate us as g1 
and v1, meaning we are properly 
governed and have the capacity 
to mitigate risk effectively.as at the date of signing of these financial statements, the board 
of bpha comprises six non-executive directors, three executive 
directors and one co-opted board member.corporate governance
during the year, we complied with our chosen code of governance, 
namely the national housing federation code of governance 2015.
the board recognises its responsibility for all aspects of the 
business and has in place a comprehensive and effective 
governance framework.the board cannot delegate ultimate responsibility for the system 
of internal control, but has delegated responsibility to the audit 
and risk committee to regularly review the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control.34 the board has received the annual report of the internal 
auditor which did not identify any matters that would undermine 
the overall integrity of the system of internal control.these risks are 
monitored quarterly, ensuring we perform within the 
parameters of the strategy and that we remain loan 
covenant compliant.there is ongoing investment 
in software systems and it infrastructure, which is 
designed to reduce the risk of external threats and 
other disruptions to core services.approval of report

co-operative and community benefit society law requires the 
board to prepare financial statements for each financial year.in preparing these financial statements, the board is required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
• state whether applicable uk accounting standards and the 
statement of recommended practice have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
