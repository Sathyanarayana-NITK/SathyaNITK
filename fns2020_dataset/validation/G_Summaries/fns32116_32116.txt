strategic report
our markets
the group’s core retail focus is the sale of consumer 
electricals and mobile phone products and connectivity.diversity 
we value the benefits a diverse workplace brings, and the 
importance diversity plays in achieving the right mix of skills, 
knowledge and experience our organisation needs to reach 
its potential.the role of the senior independent director (‘sid’), set out 
in writing and reviewed annually by the board, is to support 
the chairman, be available to any shareholders who feel 
they are unable to raise issues with the chairman directly, 
and to discuss with the chairman the results of the latter’s 
performance review.the company secretary submitted the draft 
report to the chairman and presented it to the board for 
consideration at its may 2017 meeting.the operation of these processes provides comfort on the 
standard of our customer and service delivery.the 
internal audit programme for 2016/17 consisted of reviews 
across a range of areas documented and prioritised in the 
group’s internal audit plan, which was prepared taking into 
account the principal risks across the group and approved 
with input from management and the audit committee.the audit committee chairman receives and reviews 
all reports from the internal audit department detailing 
its material findings from testing performed and any 
recommendations for improvement.details of the movements in issued share capital during 
the year are provided in note 22 to the group financial 
statements.the directors have no present intention to issue 
ordinary shares, other than pursuant to obligations under 
employee share schemes.this year the committee has continued to oversee 
the improvement of reporting and controls as well as 
responding to specific matters that have arisen.jock lennox
chairman of the audit committee

the board continues to be satisfied that the chairman of the 
committee, a member of the institute of chartered accountants 
of scotland, and gerry murphy, a member of the institute 
of chartered accountants in england and wales, both meet 
the requirement for recent and relevant financial experience.the committee’s 
deliberations are reported by its chairman at the subsequent 
board meeting and the minutes of each meeting are circulated 
to all members of the board following approval.in addition the chairman meets separately with the external 
auditor and the group director of internal audit outside of 
formal meetings and without management present.during the year ended 29 april 2017, 
consideration was given to the suitability and application of the group’s accounting policies and practices, including areas 
where significant levels of judgement have been applied or significant items have been discussed with the external auditor.• the committee concluded that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable, and that the measures used and disclosures provided were appropriate to 
provide users of the annual report and accounts 2016/17 with a meaningful assessment of the 
performance of the underlying operations of the group; the board was advised of the conclusion.• the committee concurred with the business’s plans to undertake a comprehensive gdpr 
readiness assessment and has requested management to present their findings and 
recommendations in the coming year.whilst management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an appropriate system of risk identification and internal 
control, and for the prevention and detection of irregularities and fraud, internal audit supports management in the assessment 
and mitigation of risks, as well as reporting on the effectiveness of the systems of internal control as operated by management.directors who participate in the share plan would still be 
required to pay back the remainder of the loans (10% in 
the case of the dixons awards and 20% for the carphone 
awards).the committee is 
very aware that much of the success of the group is due 
to the dedication and hard work of all our employees.corporate governance
remuneration policy
66 dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2016/17
long term incentive scheme (variable pay): long term incentive plan (‘ltip’)
• purpose and link to strategy long term incentive schemes are transparent and demonstrably aligned with the 
interests of shareholders over the long term.in particular we consulted in 2016 with our shareholders on the new remuneration policy 
being put to the vote at the annual general meeting in september 2016. where there are substantial votes against 
resolutions, explanatory reasons will be sought, and any actions in response will be communicated to shareholders.we concur with the 
treatment adopted in relation 
to the impairment of goodwill 
and other acquisition 
intangibles and are satisfied 
that the assumptions in 
the impairment model are 
within an acceptable range.management 
is therefore required to exercise 
judgement in respect of the level of 
consumer default within the contract 
period, consumer renewals, expected 
levels of consumer spend and 
consumer behaviour beyond the initial 
contract period and recognise network 
commissions when they are considered 
to be reliably measurable.in particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed.where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the group.amounts are 
only recognised where the group has a clear entitlement to 
the receipt of the rebate and a reliable estimate can be made.during the year, changes in estimates relating to contracts 
entered in previous periods totalled £21 million (2015/16: 
£3 million)  .this will have a material effect on 
both non-current and current liabilities, fixed assets and 
the measurement and disclosure of expense associated 
with the leases which under the new standard will be 
treated as depreciation and financing expense which 
were previously recognised as operating expenses over 
the term of the lease.corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the income statement 
and balance sheet and results in a non-cash remeasurement cost which can be volatile due to corporate bond yield 
rates prevailing on a particular day and is also unrepresentative of the actual investment gains or losses made or the 
liabilities paid and payable.further information about individual directors’ remuneration, share interests, share options, pensions and other 
entitlements, which form part of these financial statements, is provided in the remuneration report.the valuation expert has appropriate recognised professional qualifications as well as recent experience 
in the location and category of the properties being valued.financial statements
