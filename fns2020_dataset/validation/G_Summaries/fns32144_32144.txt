over half of our £247.1m investment in the year was in 
new situations, predominantly comprised of liberation 
group in the unquoted pool and new fund drawdowns.the funds pool performed well over the year, achieving 
a total return of 23.1%, following a total return of 5.9% 
in the previous year.all of the established funds 
performed well over the year, with the us quoted 
market and private equity funds showing particularly 
good returns.caledonia risk management process
risks are identified and assessed through a risk 
dashboard, capturing the most significant business risks 
facing caledonia and documenting the actions required 
to achieve an acceptable level of risk.he is currently non-executive chairman of nex group and 
of non-standard finance.the chief executive is responsible for the 
implementation of the board’s strategy and policies and the 
management of the company’s activities, other than those 
matters specifically reserved to the board.the schedule of 
authorities is reviewed annually by the board.further development of the 
board’s visibility of the governance and control environments 
within the larger unquoted portfolio companies was also 
identified as a key action point.first, only independent directors, being those 
who have no interest in the matter being considered, are able to 
take the relevant decision and, second, in taking the decision, 
the directors must act in a way which they consider, in good 
faith, will be most likely to promote the success of the company.going concern and viability
the audit committee considered the funding needs of the 
company and its financial capacity, including available bank 
credit and liquid funds, to be wholly sufficient to confirm the 
going concern of the business.to assist in reaching this view, the audit 
committee considered a report prepared by management 
highlighting the positive and negative statements included in 
the annual report to ensure that they fairly reflected the results 
for the year.if the governance committee believes that a director may be 
subject to a conflict of interest which may prejudice his or her 
ability to exercise independence of judgement, it may make 
such recommendations to the board as it may think fit, 
including that the director abstains from participating in any 
decision of the board or any of its committees on the matter 
concerned.work of the governance committee
the governance committee met twice during the year and the 
principal matters it considered were: 
•	 the review and approval of the corporate governance report 
for the year ended 31 march 2016
•	 the review of potential conflict situations notified by 
directors in accordance with the companies act 2006 and 
the making of recommendations to the board in relation 
thereto
•	 consideration of the influence of the cayzer family concert 
party (‘cayzer concert party’) on caledonia’s board and 
whether it was in the general interest of the non-cayzer 
concert party shareholders, with the conclusion that it was
•	 the review and approval, on behalf of the board, of the 
statements of compliance with the independence provisions 
of the listing rules relating to premium listed companies

the companies act 2006 requires the company’s auditor to 
report to the shareholders on certain parts of the directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether, in its opinion, those 
parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the large and medium-sized companies and groups 
(accounts and reports) (amendment) regulations 2013. 
the parts of the annual report on directors’ remuneration 
that have been audited are indicated in that report.executive directors are also eligible to receive other minor 
benefits and expenses payments (again including payment of any tax thereon).opportunity 
and recovery or 
withholding 
provisions
the percentage of basic salary for the chief executive is 22.5% and for other executive directors 17.5%.the remuneration committee keeps these measures 
and the levels at which incremental and maximum entitlements are earned under 
review in order to ensure that they remain sufficiently challenging and aligned 
with the company’s strategy and key performance indicators.the remuneration committee may in addition make bonus 
commitments or share awards on the appointment of an 
external candidate to compensate for remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, 
taking into account factors such as any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted, 
for example cash or shares, and the time over which they would 
have vested.in the event that a new 
director resides overseas, the remuneration committee may 
agree a reasonable relocation package and tax equalisation 
arrangements.the company’s navtr was 18.0% over the year, therefore achieving a maximum 
pay-out.for the half of the 2014 performance share scheme awards measured over the 
three years to 31 march 2017, caledonia’s annualised navtr over the period was 
11.4%, resulting in maximum vesting.the ftse all-share total return index 
has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company 
measures its delivery of value over the longer term.tsr growth over eight years

the table below shows the total remuneration received by 
the chief executive in each of the eight years to 31 march 2017, 
prepared on the same basis as in the single total figure in the 
table on page 56, and the percentage of the maximum potential 
short and long term incentives received in those years.in addition, the directors have recommended a special dividend 
of 100.0p per share (2016 – nil).we challenged the 
assumptions around sustainability of earnings based on the plans 
of investee companies and whether these are achievable and we 
obtained an understanding of existing and prospective investee 
company cash flows to understand whether borrowings can be 
serviced or refinancing may be required.6. we have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
under isas (uk and ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.in particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the audit committee report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee.finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accrual basis in the statement of comprehensive income using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise.the provision was estimated 
based on the amount of the claim against the subsidiary.the traded 
multiples for comparable companies are determined by 
dividing the enterprise value of the company by its ebitda.
