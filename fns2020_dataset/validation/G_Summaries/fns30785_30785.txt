annual report and accounts 2017 business model
we focus on long-term outcomes 
and positive social, economic 
and environmental impact.we have 
increased carer pay rates across the 
business and focused on those care 
contracts which provide a better mix of 
longevity , spend certainty and price, 
which allows us to offer carers more 
attractive terms and conditions.in addition, the care division is facing 
a challenging environment where the 
ability to recruit and retain carers is 
restricting performance.→ we are continually monitoring 
our future skills requirements.whilst the group’s continuing operations are based in the uk, 
the large network of branches does reduce the risk of serious 
business interruption.focus on building sustainable, 
long-term partnerships
we are increasingly selective 
in bidding for new contract 
opportunities.the finance cost in respect of bank borrowings 
was £2.7m (2016: £2.8m), reflecting a lower blended interest 
rate on the group’s interest rate hedging arrangement.the level of capital expenditure in respect of 
property , plant and equipment in any single year has a close 
correlation to the number of new contracts mobilised in that 
period.this became increasingly 
evident following the challenges encountered in 2017, where 
secured revenues reduced over the course of the year .principal external appointments:

key audit matter – group how the matter was addressed in the audit – group 
risk 1 – revenue recognition, 
contract accounting and onerous 
contract provisions our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
revenue is recognised throughout the 
group as the fair value of consideration 
receivable in respect of the performance 
of contracts and the provision of services.past experience has 
indicated that there is significant 
headroom in the goodwill balance relating 
to the social housing division cash 
generating unit (‘cgu’) but limited 
headroom in the goodwill balance relating 
to the care division cgu, which accounts 
for £112.3m of the carried goodwill.the group’s accounting policy on impairment is shown in the ‘principal accounting 
policies – group’ section of the financial statements and related disclosures are 
included in note 10. the audit committee identified carrying value of goodwill as a 
primary area of judgement in its report on page 61, where the audit committee 
also described the action that it has taken to address this issue.this benchmark is considered the most appropriate 
because the principal activity is that of an investment 
holding company .non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and 
the non-controlling shareholders’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.for transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change of control, the difference between the fair value of 
the consideration paid and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.deferred taxation liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences in full with no discounting.deferred taxation is calculated using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.the only element of 
revenue or profit recognition that requires judgement is against those jobs that are part complete or those completed works 
that have not been subject to a final valuation.the gross amount due from customers for contract work is presented as an asset for all contracts in progress for which costs 
incurred, plus recognised profits (less recognised losses), exceed progress billings.new standards and interpretations not yet applied
ifrs 15 ‘revenue from contracts with customers’
on 1 january 2018, ifrs 15 replaces the existing revenue recognition accounting standards – ias 18 ‘revenue’ and ias 11 
‘construction contracts’ .the majority of the charge of £1.1m (2016: charge of £0.6m) 
represents losses associated with previous acquisitions which were utilised in the year.the carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the following cgus:
goodwill
arising on purchased
consolidation goodwill total
£’000 £’000 £’000
housing 93,585 406 93,991
care 99,651 — 99,651
193,236 406 193,642
an asset is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the unit’s recoverable amount, which is based upon value in use.this trend continued following the subsequent rise in the 
national living wage in april 2017. providers have typically passed these rate increases on to their carers in full, adding some 
stability in a sector where recruitment and retention represent a significant constraint.management is particularly pleased that 
all local authorities in scotland, which covers around one third of the care activities, who have adopted the scottish living wage, 
which as at 1 april 2018 increases to £8.75 per hour.the group seeks to finance its operations through a combination of retained 
earnings and borrowings and investing surplus cash on deposit.127
