the energy excludes transport of 
goods to and from site and the movement of 
the associated vehicles on site, but internal 
transport on site is included.this restructuring programme is expected 
to complete in 2019. 
these actions will complete the integration of the pac (dispersions) 
acquisition and will allow us to deliver, as previously announced, 
the run rate synergies savings of $12m by the end of 2018, with a 
further incremental $2m of run rate savings to be delivered in 2019.
our niche businesses in specialities showed strong underlying 
volume and margin growth along with the contribution made by the 
acquisition of speciality additives.further information and the reconciliation to the ifrs measures are included in notes 2, 5 and 6.

our approach
our primary focus as an employer is to ensure that our employees 
work safely in a safe and secure environment.effective she leadership to deliver she 
performance is a primary duty and expectation of management 
at all levels in the group, aligned to our three long term goals:
1. to have no accidents or incidents; 
2. to have no adverse impact on the health of those who work in, 
or live near our operations, nor on the health of those who use 
our products; and
3. to minimise any environmental burden created by our activities.performance in 2017
an increase in energy consumption and associated emissions from 
the plant in the czech republic that uses brown coal and accounts 
for 31% of group emissions meant that overall emissions also rose 
in 2017 compared to 2016.
however, a reduction in reported voc emissions, implementation of 
energy related projects and the purchase of “green” grid electricity 
for all uk sites meant the overall emissions increase at group level 
was 1.1% tonnes co 2 equivalent/tonne production against the 2.5% 
increase in gj/tonne energy used.skills and experience: neil held senior executive 
positions at british aerospace and in the uk 
motor manufacturing industry before becoming 
chief executive of rac holdings from 1995-1999. 
neil has considerable experience as an 
independent non-executive director and public 
company chairman gained in multiple sectors 
and geographies.key appointments: no external appointments.• the board’s understanding of the views of key stakeholders and 
the markets in which the company operates was considered, 
and the board’s oversight of relevant technological 
developments, and the culture and behaviours throughout the 
company, was reviewed.we asked for regular updates to the board on particular 
aspects from the developing procurement function and the 
review of our business information processes and systems.the 
committee also had a private meeting to discuss forthcoming agendas.further details of this process are given in the governance 
section on page 56. 
other activities in the year
the committee reviewed gender pay gap data and will 
approve the proposed reporting for external publication in 
the first quarter of 2018. ceo/average employee pay ratio 
data was discussed and reviewed and will form part of our 
reporting remit from 2019 onwards.performance targets will be 
determined by the committee 
at the beginning of the annual 
performance period.the committee may adjust 
awards upward or downward 
to reflect the overall 
performance of the 
company or the individual.the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer are required to 
build interests in shares of at least 200% and 150% of salary respectively.synthomer plc annual report 2017  75

the graph above compares the total shareholder return performance of the company with that of the ftse 250 (excluding investment and

or on the transfer of securities in the company.these, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole.we have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

104  synthomer plc annual report 2017 retirement benefit costs
current and past service costs in respect of the group's defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the consolidated income 
statement.these special items are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s performance would lead to a 
distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure the group’s financial statements are in compliance with ifrs but do not 
reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year.2017 2016

5 underlying segmental performance
the ifrs profit measures show the performance of the group as a whole and as such includes all sources of income and expenses, including 
both irregular items and those that do not relate to the group’s ongoing businesses.the group considers that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from underlying performance avoids the 
potential double counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a special item from underlying performance.summarised balance sheet (100%)
