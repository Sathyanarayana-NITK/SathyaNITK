effectively and, within that, i have 
responsibility to ensure that a robust 
succession plan is in place to cover 
all eventualities.it sets the group’s

chairman following the retirement of maureen kempston darkes 
on 18 may 2017. other members during the year included the 
company chairman, phil aiken, non-executive directors stephen 
billingham (from 6 january 2017 to 6 july 2017) and iain ferguson 
(until 6 january 2017 and from 6 july 2017), and the group chief

to be submitted for review, whilst other limits vary according to 
geography and nature of the contract.5 the average middle market price of ordinary shares in the company for the three dealing dates before the psp award dates, which was used for calculating the number of shares 
granted, was 301.9p for the 2014 award, 235.4p for the 2016 award and 276.3p for the 2017 award.6  the group chief executive and chief financial ofﬁcer are required to hold shares in the company worth 200% and 150% of base salary respectively and must retain no fewer than

gain on disposal of investments 
the group continued its programme of realising accumulated value 
in the investments portfolio and generated income by disposing 
of a 20% interest in connect plus (m25) holdings ltd resulting in 
a net underlying gain of £86m after recycling gains of £85m from 
reserves to the income statement.background
the group statement of changes in equity includes the total 
comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the 
company and non-controlling interests and also discloses 
transactions which have been recognised directly in equity 
and not through the income statement.dividends
following the declaration of an interim dividend of 1.2p in 
august 2017 which was paid in december 2017, the board is 
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 2.4p, giving a total recommended 
dividend for the year of 3.6p.using the ﬁve-step 
model required by the new standard, the impact of the £3m credit 
to equity represents the acceleration of revenue on transition to 
ifrs 15 which was not recognised by the group under the previous 
revenue standards.the adoption of ifrs 16 is not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact 
on the group’s net results or net assets, although the full impact 
will be subject to further assessment.2.3 foreign currencies
transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange at the date of the transaction.provisions are recognised when: the group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that 
an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.b) taxation
the group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and 
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes.during 2017, the group 
recognised net actuarial gains of £246m in equity (2015: £120m 
losses), including its share of the actuarial gains and losses arising 
in joint ventures and associates.balfourbeatty.com/ar2017
