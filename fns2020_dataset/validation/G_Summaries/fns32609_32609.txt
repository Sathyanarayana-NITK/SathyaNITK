roll-out	 of	 the	 customer	 first	 programme	 across	
the	 group	 will	 embed	 a	 unified	 and	 elevated	 level	
of	 customer	 service	 delivery	 by	 aligning	 our	 sales	
and	 marketing	 strategy	 with	 service	 delivery.during	 the	 year,	 we	 took	 steps	 to	 further	 enhance	 our	 private	
jet	 and	 jetcard	 offers,	 and	 we	 expect	 to	 evolve	 jetcard	 in	 the	
years	 ahead	 to	 reflect	 the	 lifestyle	 needs	 of	 our	 customers,	
in	 partnership	 with	 camper	 &	 nicholsons	 international.we	 continue	 to	
monitor	 technology	 platforms	 in	 the	
private	 jet	 space,	 but	 we	 fundamentally	
believe	 –	 and	 our	 customers	 seem	
to	 agree	 –	 that	 until	 technological	
capabilities	 have	 further	 developed,	
complex	 travel	 scheduling	 is	 better	
handled	 by	 people	 rather	 than	 machines.all	 directors	 attend	
an	 annual	 strategy	 day	 with	 the	 operating	
board	 and	 other	 senior	 managers.in	 accordance	 with	 best	 practice,	 all	 other	 directors	 will	 resign	
at	 the	 2017	 agm	 and	 stand	 for	 re-election,	 with	 the	 exception	
of	 richard	 everitt	 who,	 as	 previously	 explained,	 is	 standing	
down	 from	 the	 board.the	 key	 internal	 procedures	 in	 place	 for	 the	 year	 ended	
31	 january	 2017	 and	 up	 to	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 the	 annual	
report	 are	 as	 follows:
•	a	 detailed	 and	 comprehensive	 annual	 budget	 is	 produced	
and	 formally	 approved	 by	 the	 board
•	the	 board	 maintains	 a	 schedule	 of	 key	 matters	 reserved	
for	 its	 approval,	 which	 include	 financing	 and	 changes	 to	
banking	 arrangements,	 all	 significant	 capital	 expenditure	
and	 all	 acquisitions	 and	 disposals
•	both	 the	 board	 and	 the	 operating	 board	 receive	 monthly	
financial	 reports,	 showing	 the	 performance	 of	 each	 division	
and	 country,	 with	 relevant	 commentaries	 to	 highlight	
variance	 from	 budget	 or	 particular	 areas	 of	 concern
•	business	 performance	 reports	 are	 circulated	 to	 the	
operating	 board	 on	 a	 weekly	 basis	 for	 sales	 bookings,	
and	 monthly	 to	 monitor	 overall	 performance
•	clearly	 defined	 authority	 limits	 and	 controls	 are	 in	 place	
over	 contract	 signing	 limits,	 purchasing	 commitments	 and	
the	 extension	 of	 credit	 to	 clients;	 in	 particular,	 brokers	
operate	 within	 individual,	 pre-set	 limits	 of	 authority	
and	 only	 those	 staff	 who	 have	 successfully	 completed	
a	 six-month	 probationary	 period	 can	 sign	 charter	
commitments	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 group.during	 the	 year	 under	 review,	 the	 agm	 was	
held	 in	 june	 2016	 and	 each	 member	 of	 the	 board	 attended	 and	
was	 available	 to	 take	 questions.all	 shareholders	 are	 entitled	
to	 vote	 on	 the	 resolutions	 put	 to	 the	 agm	 and	 all	 votes	 cast	 are	
counted,	 whether	 in	 person	 or	 by	 proxy,	 by	 means	 of	 a	 poll	 on	
every	 resolution	 in	 the	 notice	 of	 agm.following	 consultation	 with	 its	 advisers,	 a	 number	
of	 recommendations	 were	 put	 forward	 and	 after	 careful	
consideration	 of	 candidates	 against	 criteria	 and	 interviews	 by	
each	 member	 of	 the	 committee	 and	 the	 chief	 financial	 officer,	
the	 committee	 recommended	 to	 the	 board	 that	 shaun	 smith	
be	 appointed	 as	 a	 non-executive	 director.the	 committee	 undertook	 this	 review	 process	 throughout	 the	
year	 and	 subsequent	 to	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 to	 include	 the	
date	 of	 approval	 of	 this	 annual	 report.significant issues related to the financial statements
the	 significant	 accounting	 and	 audit	 matters	 considered	 by	
the	 committee	 and	 discussed	 with	 the	 external	 auditor	 during	
the	 year	 and	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 31	 january	 2017	 year	 end	 were:	
roll-out of new contract approval policy
as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 change	 in	 revenue	 recognition	 policy	
adopted	 in	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	 31	 january	 2016,	 the	 group	
has	 undertaken	 a	 full	 review	 of	 its	 contract	 approval	 policy	
resulting	 in	 the	 launch	 of	 a	 new	 policy	 during	 the	 year	 to	
ensure	 contracts	 that	 are	 principal	 in	 nature	 can	 be	 identified	
by	 management.based	 on	 the	 results	 of	 this	 analysis,	 the	 board	 has	 a	 reasonable	
expectation	 that	 the	 company	 will	 be	 able	 to	 continue	 in	 operation	
and	 meet	 its	 liabilities	 as	 they	 fall	 due	 over	 the	 three-year	 period	
of	 the	 assessment.going concern

of	 not	 less	 than	 12	 months	 from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 these

foreseeable	 future	 and	 that	 the	 company	 is	 a	 going	 concern.the	 reward	 structure	 for	 our	 people	 is	 built

respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
as	 explained	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 directors’	 responsibilities	 statement,	 the	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	 financial	
statements	 and	 for	 being	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view.depreciation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 so	 as	 to	 write	 off	 the	 cost	 of	 assets	 less	 their	 residual	 values	 over	 their	
estimated	 useful	 lives,	 as	 follows:
short	 leasehold	 property	 over 	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis
leasehold	 improvements	 over 	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis
fixtures	 and	 equipment	 10%-33% 	 per	 annum	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis
motor	 vehicles	 	 25%	 reducing	 balance
i) impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 group	 reviews	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 its	 tangible	 and	 intangible	 assets	 to	 determine	 whether	
there	 is	 any	 indication	 that	 those	 assets	 have	 suffered	 an	 impairment	 loss.in	 assessing	 value	 in	 use,	 the	 estimated	 future	
cash	 flows	 are	 discounted	 to	 their	 present	 value	 using	 a	 pre-tax	 discount	 rate	 that	 reflects	 current	 market	 assessments	 of	 the	
time	 value	 of	 money	 and	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 asset	 for	 which	 the	 estimates	 of	 future	 cash	 flows	 have	 not	 been	 adjusted.if	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 an	 asset	 (or	 cash-generating	 unit)	 is	 estimated	 to	 be	 less	 than	 its	 carrying	 amount,	 the	 carrying	
amount	 of	 the	 asset	 (or	 cash-generating	 unit)	 is	 reduced	 to	 its	 recoverable	 amount.financial	 assets	 are	 initially	 recognised	 at	 fair	 value	 plus	 transaction	 costs,	 except	 for	 financial	 assets	 held	
at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 which	 are	 initially	 recognised	 at	 fair	 value,	 and	 transaction	 costs	 are	 expensed	 in	 the	 income	
statement.revenue	 is	 measured	 as	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	
consideration	 received	 for	 the	 provision	 of	 goods	 and	 services	 to	 third-party	 customers	 and	 is	 stated	 exclusive	 of	 value	 added	
tax	 and	 is	 only	 recognised	 where	 there	 is	 a	 contractual	 right	 to	 receive	 consideration	 for	 work	 undertaken,	 the	 amount	 can	 be	
measured	 reliably	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 future	 economic	 benefits	 will	 flow.97 air partner plc  |  annual report and accounts 2017
