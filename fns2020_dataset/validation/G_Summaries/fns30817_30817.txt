strategic report 
corporate responsibility 27
we provide every member of the team with equal opportunities 
to thrive, as well as specific and relevant job-related training 
designed to expand individual capabilities and give people 
the tools needed to reach their potential.we have used the world business council for sustainable 
development/world resources institute greenhouse gas 
protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard (revised 
edition), and emission factors from the uk 2013 government’s 
ghg conversion factors for company reporting.damage to our fbo network was limited 
although there were some excess payments made on our insurance 
policies by signature.looking forward the combination of an efficient, lower 
cost, flexible engine overhaul and test facility in dfw and a renewed 
focus on customer service will drive further improvement in financial 
performance and allow us to execute our strategy for value creation 
from our ero business.executive directors must obtain the prior consent of the board before accepting  
a non-executive directorship in any other company.senior 
managers’ performance and related financial incentives are tied in part to their 
success against selected annual hse improvement objectives.in accordance with the uk corporate governance code, the audit and risk 
committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of internal audit using 
outside specialists as well as self-assessment techniques.we made 
a number of changes to the proposed policy as a direct result of feedback from 
shareholders.in accordance with the arrangements on appointment there was no change to the 
fee payable to the chairman in respect of 2017. the non-executive directors’ fees were increased in line with the increases for other members of staff.64

the committee does not expect to change the pension or benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2018.
annual cash bonus
for 2018, the committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 65% of salary (subject to shareholder approval at the agm) and 
will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives.in respect of the 2017 financial year, simon pryce will receive a bonus pro-rated to the period worked during the year and based on the satisfaction of the performance 
conditions at the end of the year.the committee may make adjustments for exceptional items in the performance period if it is not fair and equitable to do so.the remuneration package for any new recruit would be determined in accordance with the principles set out on page 76. the committee is mindful that it wishes to 
avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and is aware of guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or 
long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance conditions associated with the award.the committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are 
made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim 
arising in connection with the termination of an executive director’s office or employment.agreements
under section 992 of the companies act 2006, the company discloses that in the 
event of a change of control in the company: (i) the company’s commitments under 
the $1,650 million acquisition financing agreement dated 23 september 2015 and as 
amended and restated on 16 november 2015, its $650 million revolving credit facility 
dated 10 april 2014, its $300 million private note placement dated 18 may 2011 (as 
amended) and its $200 million private note placement dated 17 december 2014 
could become repayable; (ii) the engine lease agreement dated 29 june 2009 (as 
amended) under which $83 million of aircraft engines have been leased to the engine 
repair & overhaul (ero) business could be terminated; (iii) the consent of netjets 
would be required for the transfer of the benefits under its contract with signature 
flight support; (iv) the operating licence with london luton airport operations 
may be terminable; and (v) certain licence agreements within the ero and ontic 
businesses are terminable or require the consent of the counterparty but none of 
these contracts in their own right are significant to the group.we are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the 
uk, including the financial reporting council’s (frc’s) ethical standard as applied to 
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements.equity investments that fall within the scope of the 
standard are usually measured at fvtpl unless an irrevocable 
election is made to recognise them within other comprehensive 
income.associated undertakings are those investments other than 
subsidiary undertakings where the group is in a position to exercise 
a significant influence, typically through participation in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee.subsequently associates and joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method, where the group’s share of post-
acquisition profits and losses and other comprehensive income 
is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and 
other comprehensive income (except for losses in excess  
of the group’s investment in the associate or joint venture unless 
there is an obligation to make good those losses).management must be committed to the sale which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one 
year of the date of classification.the value-in-use calculations are based 
on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and detailed financial projections for the next four years, as approved by 
management, with a terminal growth rate after four years.the business’ assets 
were impaired in 2016 based on the fair market value established in that disposal process, see note 25.
in relation to signature flight support and ontic, management has concluded that for these cgus no reasonably foreseeable change in the 
key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.as a result of this performance and with no visible recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft 
flying, an impairment review was carried out at 30 june 2016 for both the dai and h+s cgus within the ero business.notes to the consolidated financial statements – continued 119

where assets have been written down or impaired, the recoverable amount has been determined by reference to its value in use, estimated 
using the forecast cash flows over the remaining life of the asset and discounted using a rate of 10.0% (31 december 2016: 10.9%).included in the group’s trade receivables balances are debtors with a carrying amount of $47.0 million (2016: $58.7 million) which are past due 
at the reporting date for which the group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are 
still considered recoverable.the fair value on initial recognition is the 
transaction price unless part of the consideration given or received is for something other than the instrument itself.146

the number of options and the associated share prices in the tables below have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the shares 
issued under the terms of the rights issue.at the beginning of april 2016, management committed to a 
plan to sell substantially all of the asig business and as such at that point the relevant assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale.the remuneration of directors and key executives is determined by the remuneration committee having regard to the performance of 
individuals and market trends.deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.the final cash 
contribution will be made by the abf structure to the plan in march 2034, at which point the prepayment will be fully unwound.
