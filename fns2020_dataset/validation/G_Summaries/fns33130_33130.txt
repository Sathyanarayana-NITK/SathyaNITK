the group agrees payment terms with suppliers
when it enters into purchase contracts, taking
into account local good practice, and seeks to
abide by these payment terms whenever
satisfied that the supplier has provided the
goods or services in accordance with the agreed
terms and conditions.the company encourages all of its employees to
participate in the growth of the group and
welcomes staff input at all levels.when new members are appointed to the board,
they are provided with advice from the company’s
solicitors in respect of their role and duties as a
public company director .the
details of each executive director’s individual
package are fixed by the committee in line with
the policy adopted by the full board.because of the limitations that are inherent in any
system of internal control, this system is designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance
against material misstatement or loss.the group has well established procedures which
have been developed over many years for
identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the group.• terms of reference for the board and its
subcommittees, including a schedule of matters
reserved for the board and an agreed annual
programme of fixed agenda items for board
approval.at present, the size of the business
is at a scale that does not justify the need for a
full-time internal audit function.where necessary, specific work is
commissioned to supplement published
as well as complying with provisions of the
combined code as disclosed in the corporate
governance statement, the company has
applied the principles relating to directors’
remuneration as described below.in preparing those financial statements, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards
have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements, and
• prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company and the group will
continue in business.the directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and the group and to
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the companies act
1985. they are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and
the group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.we report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view
and are properly prepared in accordance with
the companies act.an audit includes
examination on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.long term
projects are assessed on a project by project basis
and are reflected in the profit and loss account by
recording turnover according to the degree of com-
pletion.• foreign currency and financial instruments
exchange profits and losses resulting from trading
are accounted for in the results for the period.results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the
relevant period.this resulted in a reduction of the tax charge for the year ended 30 june 2001
amounting to £1,000,000 of which £391,000 was debited to deferred tax asset and of which £609,000
was debited to corporation tax.13 • acquisitions
