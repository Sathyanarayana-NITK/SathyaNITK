auditors
the directors who were members of the board at the time of 
approving the report of the directors are listed on pages 36 to 
37. having made enquiries of fellow directors and of the 
company’s auditors, each of these directors confirms that:
• so far as each director is aware, there is no information 
relevant to the preparation of the company’s auditor’s 
report of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• each director has taken all the steps a director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
company’s auditors are aware of that information.under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent company and of the profit 
or loss of the group and parent company for that period.the directors’ impairment assessment showed that all 
segments had headroom above the carrying value of the net 
assets including goodwill when subject to the directors’ 
sensitivity analysis.the plc finance team consolidates the reporting packs of communications; medical; marketing; and immersive and the 
central functions.going concern
in accordance with isas (uk) we report as follows:
reporting obligation outcome
we are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.impairment testing is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which the 
goodwill relates.transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies are initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.at the time of approving the 
financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and are forecasting to remain in compliance with future covenant 
facility requirements.accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparation in the financial statements.in making this adjustment, inputs 
required are the equity market risk premium (that is the increased return required over and above a risk-free rate by an investor 
who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment (‘beta’) applied to reflect the risk of the cgu relative to the 
market as a whole.the amount arising or released in the prior year represented a change in the estimated future 
financial performance of the acquired company.specific details of the exercise conditions of options granted to directors are set out in the report of the directors on 
remuneration.in particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.(ca06)
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the corporate governance 
statement (on pages 40 to 43) with respect to the parent company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its 
administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the 
dtr.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
