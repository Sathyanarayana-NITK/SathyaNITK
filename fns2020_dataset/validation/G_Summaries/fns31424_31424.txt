the 2017 losses
have been fully recognised in these accounts 
so any improvement in the next two years 
will contribute to earnings.the accounting policy requires an assessment 
of the carrying value of each syndicate 
participation against the latest average auction 
prices.the capacity acquired on the “off-risk” years 
that is retained 100% by helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the group.the aep 1 in 30 figure is the weighted average of each syndicate’s 1 in 30 projections which serves as a guide to the portfolio aggregate.the 2017 losses 
from three hurricanes making landfall in the us were significant but the losses were absorbed 
by the strong capital position of the insurance industry.the high aggregation of coastal 
exposures in the us and other developed markets is one reason why further catastrophe 
losses and dislocations cannot be ruled out in the future.the committee meets the auditors and 
reviews reports from the auditors relating to 
the accounting and internal control systems.conclusions relating to going concern 
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the isas (uk) require us to report to you where: 
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.annual report and financial statements 2017 — helios underwriting plc 21

matters on which we are required to report by exception 
in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.helios underwriting plc — annual report and financial statements 2017 26

the notes are an integral part of these financial statements.the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources to meet their underwriting and other 
operational obligations for the foreseeable future.the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised and recorded 
as goodwill.adjustments to the 
amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the adjustments are made.the provision is made on 
a syndicate-by-syndicate basis by the relevant managing agent.closed years of account
at the end of the third year, the underwriting account is normally closed by reinsurance into the following year of account.the provision is determined initially by the managing agent on 
a similar basis to the reinsurance to close.the key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty set out below therefore relate to those made in respect of the company 
only, and do not include estimates and judgements made in respect of the syndicates.for the purposes of setting capital requirements for the 2017 and subsequent years of account, each managing agent will have prepared a 
lloyd’s capital return (“lcr”) for the syndicate to agree capital requirements with lloyd’s based on an agreed assessment of the risks impacting 
the syndicate’s business and the measures in place to manage and mitigate those risks from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.annual report and financial statements 2017 — helios underwriting plc 39

5. segmental information
nigel hanbury is the group’s chief operating decision-maker.the group’s role in managing these risks, in conjunction 
with the group’s members’ agent, is limited to a selection of syndicate participations and monitoring the performance of the syndicates and 
their managing agents.15. financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
the group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
level 1: the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded securities) is based on quoted market prices 
(unadjusted) at the end of the reporting period.the group entered into a lloyd’s deposit trust deed which gives lloyd’s the right to apply these monies in settlement of 
any claims arising from the participation on the syndicates.after the alignment of accounting policies and other 
adjustments to the valuation of assets and liabilities to reflect their fair value at acquisition, the fair value of the net assets was £279,000.the following table explains the fair value adjustments made to the carrying values of the major categories of assets and liabilities at the 
date of acquisition:
