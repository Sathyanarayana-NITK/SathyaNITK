we have worked in partnership with the london 
borough of bexley to design a masterplan for 
the shopping centre, retail park and surrounding 
council owned land.as part of this process we have 
identified the potential to build a number of towers 
in the airspace above our existing ownership, and 
whilst we are unlikely to build all of these towers, 
we have now included provision for up to 300 units 
within the ‘early feasibility stage’ section of our 
risk‑controlled development pipeline.41 newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017

as well as generating high levels of low risk cash

of inbuilt value creating development opportunities.the asset manager is responsible for risk within

the company and its advisers monitor any 
changes to the relevant legislations that affect 
the group’s business and how these changes 
may affect it.the annual strategy is two‑fold:
1. raise funds for a single charitable cause at 
a corporate and portfolio level with an agreed 
fundraising target set at the beginning of the year
2. each newriver shopping centre will support 
a single charity important to the local community 
they belong to, with a fundraising target set at 
the beginning of the year.there is a clear division of responsibility between the chairman, who is responsible for the leadership of the board, and the c hief 
executive, who is responsible for managing and leading the business.as part of this process the 
committee meets with the company’s auditors, deloitte, who 
produce a detailed report covering their audit plans, materiality 
criteria and any issues identified during the course of their 
audit together with recommendations for improving accounting 
processes.internal control structure 
the group does not have an inte rnal audit team.while all of 
the necessary checks and balances were being done, the 
documentation confirming this was not always completed in a 
timely manner and this will be addressed during the current year.audit plan 
in respect of the audit for the financial year ended 31 march 
2017, deloitte presented their audit plan (prepared in 
consultation with management) to the committee.the details of this 
process are to be found on the following page.alongside the development of the remuneration policy, the 
company developed a new annual bonus plan to operate 
from the 2017/18 financial year.the executive directors delivered 
successfully against a range of financial, operational and 
strategic objectives including, but not exclusively, paying a 
progressive, fully covered dividend, increasing the value of 
assets under management and transitioning the business from 
aim to the main market.82 newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017

going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the group 
as required by the listing rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained 
within note 1 to the financial statemen ts and the directors’ statement on the 
longer-term viability of the group contained within the directors’ report on  
page 104. 
we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to: 
• the directors’ confirmation on page 74 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; 
• the disclosures on pages 55 to 57 that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated; 
• the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; and 
• the directors’ explanation on page 120 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what peri od they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.the extent and variety of judgements involved in the valuation of the pub portfolio is different to the rest 
of the investment property portfolio due to the specific operational nature of the properties, as well as the 
contractual arrangements in place with marston’s, the co-op and lt pub management.in determining whether other acquisitions and dispos als were considered to be material or complex by 
nature, we made inquiries of management, examined the sale and purchase agreements for a sample 
of transactions and recalculated the relevant accounting entries made.110 newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017   newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017

our application of materiality 
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.financial statements
