> further developing leadership and management capabilities
> improving the strength and diversity of the talent pipeline
>  improving employee engagement.us corporate integrity agreement reporting
in april 2010, astrazeneca signed an agreement with the us 
department of justice to settle an investigation relating to the  
sales and marketing of seroquel ir.astrazeneca has ended the investigation of zibotentan as a potential 
treatment for cancer following the results of clinical trials in patients 
with advanced prostate cancer.a competitor to 
crestor, atorvastatin, was available in generic form in the us beginning 
in late 2011.
seroquel continued to be the most prescribed atypical anti-psychotic, 
with sales up 10% to $4,123 million (2010: $3,747 million).these measures are adjusted to exclude certain significant  
items, such as charges and provisions related to our global 
restructuring programmes, amortisation and impairment of the 
significant intangibles relating to the acquisition of medimmune  
in 2007, the amortisation and impairment of the significant 
intangibles relating to our current and future exit arrangements 
with merck in the us and other specified items.in cases where the transaction 
has two or more components, we account for the delivered item  
(for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate 
unit of accounting and record revenue on delivery of that component 
provided that we can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value  
of the undelivered component.the roles of the board, the board committees, the chairman, the 
ceo and the set are documented, as are the board’s delegated 
authorities and reserved powers.for the purposes of the uk 
corporate governance code, the board remains satisfied that at least 
one member of the audit committee has recent and relevant financial 
experience.the committee meets regularly to assist and inform the 
decisions of the ceo concerning inside information and its disclosure.the annual corporate contributions 
budget is reviewed and approved by the us general counsel, the  
us vice-president, corporate affairs and the president of our us 
business to ensure robust governance and oversight.we have changed the format of the report this year.without reducing 
disclosure, we have sought in the first part to answer the question: 
what was paid to the executive directors in 2011 and why?this report has been prepared in accordance with the large and 
medium-sized companies and groups (accounts and reports) 
regulations 2008 (regulations) and meets the relevant requirements 
of the financial services authority’s listing rules.>  during 2011, as a result of the vesting of the 2008 share award 
under the psp, the ceo received 201,932 ordinary shares and  
a cash payment in respect of dividends accrued.>  a review of performance metrics used by the r&d organisation.performance conditions and performance targets
psp
other than in exceptional circumstances, which are prescribed in the psp rules, the vesting of psp share awards is contingent on the satisfaction of specified performance 
targets (balanced equally between cash flow and tsr) and continued employment with the group.the board believes that the processes and accountabilities which are 
in place (described below) provide it with adequate information on the 
key risks and uncertainties we face.these include: failure to obtain the required regulatory 
or marketing approvals for the product candidate or its manufacturing facilities; unfavourable 
clinical efficacy data; safety concerns; failure of r&d to develop new product candidates; and 
failure to demonstrate adequate cost effective benefits to regulators and the emergence of 
competing products.the predictability of the outcome and timing of 
review processes remains challenging, particularly  
in the us, due to competing regulatory priorities and 
a continuing sentiment of risk aversion on the part of 
regulatory reviewers and management.also, 
under many of our strategic alliances, we make milestone payments well in advance of the 
commercialisation of the products, with no assurance that we will recoup these payments.many 
of these mechanisms shift a greater proportion of the cost of medicines to the individual via 
out-of-pocket payments at the pharmacy counter.in some cases, those governments most severely impacted by the 
economic downturn may seek alternative ways to settle their debts through, for example, the 
issuance of government bonds which might trade at a discount to the value of the debt.basis for preparation of financial statements 
on a going concern basis
information on the business environment astrazeneca operates 
in, including the factors underpinning the industry’s future growth 
prospects, are included in the directors’ report.these assets are not used in the research and 
development activities of other products.our 
pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.during 2011, the group disposed of astra tech (see 
note 22) resulting in a curtailment gain of $44m.in september 2010, astrazeneca and merck reached an agreement 
with respect to the treatment of vimovo under the agreements, 
pursuant to which astrazeneca will pay merck certain amounts with 
respect to vimovo only if it exercises the second option and as part 
of the exercise price for the second option.patent litigation
arimidex (anastrozole)
patent/regulatory proceedings outside the us
astrazeneca is engaged in proceedings in canada and russia 
regarding patent and/or regulatory exclusivity for arimidex.in november 2011, the tokyo high court reversed 
the tokyo district court’s decision and ruled that neither astrazeneca, 
nor the japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare, had any 
liability for the iressa product liability claims filed in the tokyo district 
court.in 2011, astrazeneca paid 
$35.75m in aggregate in connection with agreements to settle the 
claims of the putative class of direct purchasers and those plaintiffs who 
have opted-out of that class.in july 2011, medimmune received a similar court order to produce 
documents from the office of the attorney general for the state of 
new york medicaid and fraud control unit.all other services include assurance services in relation to third party compliance with manufacturing and distribution agreements and third 
party royalty agreements, an audit in connection with the disposal of astra tech, and advisory services supporting management in their 
development of competency and development frameworks for staff, and in their outsourcing arrangements for the provision of it infrastructure.
