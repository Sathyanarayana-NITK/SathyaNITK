appointed to the board in april

director of asos plc, shaftesbury 
plc and london and partners

to maintaining the highest standards 
within the group.it meets monthly to review operating 
performance and has delegated 
authority from the board to deal with 
operational matters such as the  
approval of minor capital projects and 
refurbishments, the agreement and 
approval of minor contracts with third 
parties and employee appointments.in identifying suitable candidates the 
committee shall:
•  consider candidates from a wide 
range of backgrounds
•  consider candidates on merit and 
against objective criteria, taking care 
that appointees have enough time 
available to devote to the position
•  consider the use of external advisers 
or advertising to facilitate the search, 
if applicable; and
•  consider the requirements set out in 
the company’s memorandum and 
articles of association.deloitte llp has been the company’s 
auditor since 2009. their performance  
is reviewed by the committee which 
considers their effectiveness and 
independence, and partner rotation, 
which occurred at the start of 2017.
the auditor provides taxation advisory 
services in addition to audit services and 
from time to time may provide non-audit 
services to the group.key 
features of the system of internal control 
include a detailed review of performance 
against budgets and forecasts which are 
subject to scrutiny and approval, reports 
to the board from each operating area, a 
requirement for authorisation of capital 
expenditure following formal investment 
appraisals and a close involvement of the 
executive directors in the operation of 
the business.the chairman, chief 
executive and finance and it director 
make an annual presentation of the 
group’s results to professional investors 
and analysts.in addition to funding 
a pension, the company maintains an

which enables them to maintain contact 
with former colleagues.the remuneration committee is chaired 
by bill brett.the aggregate gain, subject to tax,  
made by the highest paid director on  
the exercise of share options in 2016  
was £86,000.due to changes in legislation the highest 
paid director and one other executive 
director are no longer contributing 
members of the company pension 
scheme.the shares were acquired  
in connection with the company’s future 
obligations under the share schemes.in preparing those financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•  state whether applicable uk 
accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.conclusions relating to going concern
we are required by isas (uk) to report in 
respect of the following matters where:
•  the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparation of the 
financial statements is not appropriate; or 
•  the directors have not disclosed in the 
financial statements any identified 
material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the group’s or the 
parent company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include 
the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified.these matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.we have 
therefore identified the valuation of the 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
as a significant risk of material misstatement.responsibilities of directors
as explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. |strategicreport |governance |  financial statements |otherinformation
