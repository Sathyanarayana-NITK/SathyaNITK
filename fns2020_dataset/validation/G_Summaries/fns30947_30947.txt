the importance placed by the company on 
human rights is reflected in the group’s training 
programme which seeks to ensure that all 
employees are aware of their rights and the 
company’s commitments.the ongoing inflationary environment which exceeds the rate of devaluation 
of the argentinian peso relative to the us dollar has led to an increase in 
costs for the group as an exporter.under the terms of the agreement, each of 
eduardo hochschild and pelham investment 
corporation (being the entity through which  
mr hochschild holds his shares in the company) 
(the ‘major shareholder’) undertakes that:
i.   all transactions with the company (and its 
subsidiaries) will be conducted at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms;
ii.a crucial part of the role of the senior 
independent director is to meet with major 
shareholders if concerns have not been 
addressed by the executive team.sustainability
 – reviews of the social and political climate in 
peru and argentina and their potential impact 
on the group;
 – review of the community-led blockade which 
temporarily prevented access to the pallancata 
mine; and
 – performance of the group against the 
internally-designed environmental corporate 
scorecard.– risk management – consideration and 
challenge of risk management assessments 
which incorporate a risk matrix detailing  
(i) the most significant risks facing the group; 
(ii) an evaluation reflecting the likelihood of 
the occurrence of the risk and the extent of the 
potential impact on the group, and  
(iii) commentary on the steps taken to 
manage each specific risk.– whistleblowing – the audit committee 
reviewed the adequacy of the group’s 
whistleblowing policy taking into account the 
reports received through the various online 
and offline channels established by the group.safeguards
additional safeguards to ensure auditor 
objectivity and independence include:
 – six-monthly reports to the audit committee 
from the auditor analysing the fees for 
non-audit services rendered; and
 – an annual assessment, by the audit committee, 
of the auditor’s objectivity and independence 
in light of all relationships between the 
company and the audit firm.on 1 january 2018, michael 
rawlinson assumed the chair of the committee 
following enrico bombieri’s retirement from the 
board, and eileen kamerick was appointed a 
member of the committee.the directors 
may also decline to recognise any instrument 
of transfer relating to a certificated share 
unless the instrument of transfer:
 (i)   is duly stamped (if required) and is 
accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate(s) and such other evidence of 
the right to transfer as the directors may 
reasonably require; and 
 (ii)  is in respect of only one class of share.dividends and distributions
subject to the provisions of the companies act, 
the company may by ordinary resolution from 
time to time declare dividends not exceeding the 
amount recommended by the directors.we have also increased the minimum shareholding 
requirement for executive directors from 200% to 250% of salary and, in 
recognition of prevailing best practice and the investor focus in this area, 
we have widened the scope of the group’s malus policy such that a wider 
variety of acts (or failure to act) may be brought within the remuneration 
committee’s discretion to reduce incentive payouts.the company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level 
of experience, responsibility, individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.not applicable
dbp
death, ill health, disability, redundancy, injury, 
retirement with agreement of the director, or any 
other reasons the committee may determine in its 
absolute discretion
any outstanding awards would typically be pro-rated 
for time.the fee paid to the chairman is determined by the 
committee, and base fees to non-executive directors are 
determined by the board.overview of our audit approach
key audit 
matters
 – recoverability of the carrying value of the group’s mining assets
 – revenue recognition
 – mine rehabilitation provisions
audit scope – we performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components, for two components we performed audit procedures 
on specific accounts and for the remaining 13 components we performed other audit procedures
 – the components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 97% of adjusted ebitda (on absolute basis), 100% of 
revenue and 96% of total assets
materiality – overall group materiality of us$6.0m (2016: us$6.3m) which represents approximately 2% of adjusted ebitda

further information key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.as a result of the audit 
procedures performed, 
we have concluded  
that management’s 
impairment indicator 
analysis and impairment 
assessment for the 
group’s cgus has been 
carried out appropriately 
and in accordance with 
the requirements of ifrs.the significant number of sales transactions and complex terms 
under which title, risks and rewards pass to the customer 
increases the risk of cut-off errors.we have also identified risks in 
relation to the calculation of the adjustment for provisional 
pricing, including the estimate of silver and gold in the 
concentrate sold.the group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the senior statutory auditor visits each of 
the primary operating locations where the group audit scope was focused.in addition, the primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process, attended closing meetings either in person or by call and reviewed key audit working papers 
on risk and other areas.under ias 18, revenue is recognised at the estimated fair value of the 
total consideration received or receivable when the gold and silver is delivered, which is usually when title has passed to the customer.goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the nci, and any 
previously interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.t ogether 
with the us$29,396,000 recognised as a deferred income (refer to note 23) that will be realised once the option is exercised or terminated; the total 
recoverable value of the project under a value in use approach amounts to us$37,081,000.on 30 november 2016, imsc renegotiated terms of the agreement, extending the validity of the agreement to 1 december 2017 .the 
options vest over a five-year period in tranches of 20% of the shares after each of 2, 3 and 4 years and the balance after 5 years.annual report & accounts 2017

peru 
in accordance with peruvian legislation, owners of mining concessions must pay a mining royalty for the exploitation of metallic and non metallic resources.t o manage the credit risk associated with commercial activities, the group took the following steps:
 – active use of prepayment/advance clauses in sales contracts
 – delaying delivery of title and/or requiring advance payments to reduce exposure timeframe (potential delay in sales recognition)
 – obtaining parent guarantees or contracting directly with parent company to shore up the credit profile of the customer (where possible)
 – maintaining as diversified a portfolio of clients as possible
t o manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the group took the following steps:
 – increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk
 – limiting exposure to financial counterparties according to board approved limits
 – investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments (money market accounts, term deposits, us t reasuries)
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.the other financial instruments of the group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest 
bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.the financial statements are presented in us dollars (us$) and all 
monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.movements in the provision for impairment of receivables:
