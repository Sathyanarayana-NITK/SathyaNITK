our people
as part of our vital initiatives for the coming year we are committed to 
providing development opportunities for our employees and have 
been working with them on individual employee development plans 
to deliver the required targeted training to allow them to deliver 
enhanced performance to the business in its growth phase.we have 
completed surgeon and industry voice of customer feedback, 
identified the regulatory and pre-clinical pathways and targeted 
our pre-clinical trials to begin in early 2018 with wound market 
clearance expected to follow in late 2018.
additionally, the company’s cartilage chondromimetic
®
 programme 
has advanced significantly since the acquisition of the assets of 
orthomimetics at the end of 2015. with first human use in 2009 and 
original launch in 2010, chondromimetic
®
 offers a rare opportunity to 
come to market with over seven years of in-patient results.the r&d side of our strategy has evolved the most in selecting our 
key three projects (cartilage, wound healing and bone grafts) and 
doing the in-depth work to refine the customer requirements and 
novel product attributes.the group recognises and seeks to encourage the involvement 
of its employees, with the aim being the recruitment, motivation and 
retention of quality employees throughout the group.the functional currency of the company 
is sterling.overheads
the group has continued to invest in both its sales and marketing 
and r&d resources during the year in order to support the growth 
in global demand for its products and services.there was also a revision to the cash earn-out payable under the 
southern lights biomaterials agreement resulting in a release 
of £0.262 million (2016: £nil) both of which are shown in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as separately 
identifiable items.the key elements of the control system in operation are:
• 
the board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
for decision and has put in place an organisational structure 
with clear lines of responsibility defined and with appropriate 
delegation of authority; 
• 
the subsidiaries’ boards also meet regularly with a formal 
schedule of matters for decision; and
• 
there are procedures for the planning, approval and monitoring 
of capital expenditure and information systems for monitoring 
the group’s financial performance against approved budgets 
and forecasts.going concern
the directors believe that the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting is appropriate because they consider that the group 
has considerable financial resources, together with a robust sales 
pipeline and commitments from a number of customers.remuneration policy
the policy of the committee is to reward executive directors 
in line with the current remuneration of directors in comparable 
businesses in order to recruit, motivate and retain high-quality 
executives within a competitive marketplace, thereby enhancing 
shareholder value.results and dividends
the trading results for the year and the group’s financial position 
at the end of the year are shown in the attached financial statements.the financial statements are required by law and ifrss adopted 
by the eu to present fairly the financial position of the group and 
the company and the financial performance of the group.this report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006. 
our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.the locations and principal activities of the subsidiaries are 
set out in note 10. the registered office is c/o shepherd and wedderburn llp, condor house, 10 st. paul’s churchyard, london ec4m 8al.the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial liabilities incorporated at fair value.the difference between the amount of revenue recognised and the amount invoiced 
on a particular contract is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as deferred income.the subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify 
as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.derecognition of financial instruments
the derecognition of financial assets takes place when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial 
instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all of the cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed 
through to an independent third party.the results and financial position of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
(a)  assets and liabilities for each reporting date are translated at the closing rate at that date; and
(b)  income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate 
on the dates of the transactions).deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset 
is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.with the exception of ifrs 16, none of these amendments are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the group.4 separately identifiable items

1.  the release of the contingent consideration provision in the year ended 31 march 2017 relates to the reassessment of the earn-outs payable for the acquisitions 
of collagen solutions llc and collagen solutions nz limited (formerly southern lights ventures 2002 limited).the release in the year ended 31 march 2016 
relates to the reassessment of the earn-outs payable for the acquisition of collagen solutions llc.this is because the outstanding share options would have the effect 
of reducing the loss per ordinary share and would therefore not be dilutive under the terms of ias 33. goodwill relates to the acquisition of collagen solutions (uk) limited, the purchase of the 
assets of collagen solutions llc in january 2014, the acquisition of southern lights ventures 2002 limited in december 2014 and the 
investment in cre8ive collagen limited in july 2016. this goodwill has been allocated to the combined group as a single cgu for the 
purposes of the impairment review, since this is the lowest level within the entity at which management monitors goodwill for internal 
purposes.the key assumptions underlying the cash flow projections within the impairment review are revenue growth, margins 
and the level of operating expenditure.key assumptions used in the growth calculations for years ended 2017 to 2019 are:
• 
gross margins  – between 70% and 73%
• 
annual revenue growth – between 37% and 53%
• 
increase in operating costs – between 2% and 11%
the recoverable amount of the cgu exceeds the carrying amount of the cgu by 422.9%.the directors consider the revenues to be 
the most sensitive assumption used in the impairment reviews.notes to the financial statements continued financial statements
