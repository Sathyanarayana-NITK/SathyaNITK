as evidenced by the differing performance in the early and late summer 
periods this financial year, the weather will continue to have an impact 
on the timing of customer purchase, but the overall trends are positive.this 
measure helps to understand 
the financing structure of the 
group.in the annual report & accounts the 
board sets out what it considers to be the principal commercial and 
financial risks to achieving the group’s objectives.2. business strategy
the aim of the group’s business 
strategy is to deliver long-term 
value to our shareholders.profits and dividends
the group’s results for the year are set out in the consolidated income 
statement on page 108. the profit before tax on ordinary activities was 
£75.4m (2016: £81.5m) and the profit after tax amounted to £59.5m 
(2016: £64.9m).the assessment of 
viability has specifically considered risks that could threaten the 
group’s day-to-day operations and existence.the assessment 
considered how risks could affect the business now, and how they 
may develop over three years; and
• financial analysis and forecasts showing current financial position 
and performance, cash flow projections, dividend strategy, 
funding requirements and funding facilities.director t enure

succession planning for the board is ongoing and as the 
chairman, dennis millard, will have been in office for nine 
years in 2018 and so, in accordance with best practice, the 
intention is that he will stand down at the annual general 
meeting in july 2018. t o manage this succession, in the 
second half of the financial year ahead the nomination 
committee will begin the process of identifying suitable 
candidates and recommending an appointment to the 
board.where raised 
and unresolved in a board meeting, the unresolved business can 
be recorded on behalf of a director in the minutes of the relevant 
meeting.the principle 
that candidates are considered “on merit and against objective 
criteria, and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the board, 
including gender” is established in the t erms of reference of the 
nomination committee.our process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the group and assessing the effectiveness of related 
controls routinely identifies areas for improvement, but the board has 
neither identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses that 
it has determined to be material or significant.management 
continually strives to produce a clear and transparent annual 
report and accounts, which provides a complete picture; 
• the corporate website – provides investors with timely 
information on the group’s performance as well as details of 
corporate social responsibility activities; 
• management roadshow – allows key investors to access 
management, usually attended by the chief executive officer, 
chief financial officer and ir director;
• attending broker conferences – management regularly attend 
and present at various conferences hosted by a variety of 
brokers to ensure a wide variety of shareholders, including 
those from different geographies, also have access to 
management; and
• responding promptly – the group is committed to responding 
to any investor-related queries within a short time frame.chairman’s introduction 
i am pleased to present the report of

of halfords’ corporate governance framework 
with particular emphasis on the quality of financial 
reporting, internal control, and risk management 
systems.david adams

audit committee also provide the opportunity for the independent 
non-executive directors to meet without the executive directors 
present and to raise any issues of concern with the auditor.provisions are made 
to reflect this.overall, the committee is confident that the proposed approach will support the 
company’s strategy over the next three years, and that it is fair and balanced.restricted share plan (“rsp”)
the committee has introduced a new share plan to promote further 
the alignment of more colleagues’ interests with shareholders and 
to support engagement and commitment.executive directors are 
excluded from the rsp.• link variable pay to performance and the delivery of the 
agreed strategy – provide management with the opportunity to 
earn competitive remuneration through annual and long-term 
variable pay arrangements that are designed to support delivery 
against key strategic objectives.the majority of the award will be subject 
to meeting a financial performance target.for these purposes ‘payments’ includes the committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time 
the award is granted.performance share plan (“psp”): the performance measures for 
2017 awards are group revenue and underlying eps growth.the remuneration package for a newly appointed non-executive director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy table 
for non-executive directors above.as set out in the chief executive’s statement 
on page 6, the results of the autocentres 
division were not in line with management’s 
expectations, and, as such, the risk of 
impairment to the associated goodwill has 
increased.employee benefits
i) pensions
the halfords pension plan is a contract-based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor 
independently.depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
• leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
• leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;
• motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
• fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
• computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
• land is not depreciated.key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due.all financial assets are 
recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.the tredz and wheelies businesses contributed £36.7m revenue and a profit of £1.8m to the group’s profit before tax for the period between 
the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.the goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the uk which management monitors on an 
overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being car servicing.this is the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which is not higher than the group’s operating segments as reported in note 1. 
the value-in-use of the goodwill held at 31 march 2017 and 1 april 2016 is driven by, and is most sensitive to, the key assumptions underlying 
the recoverable amounts of the group cash-generating units, which are the discount rate and growth rate.the growth rates used beyond the range of the budgets 
are shown on the next page.
