a number of significant transactions were, however, 
completed in 2017. 
the main european transaction of note, was the 
acquisition of de boer structures by losberger- 
creating the largest structures business in the world.our first acquisition since the ipo was gld 
productions, a specialist provider of furniture into 
the music and event sectors, based in the uk.revenue grew in all regions, 
with particularly strong organic revenue growth in the 
us, with the winning and delivery of three events for 
the us pga adding some £5m of incremental revenue 
in 2017. the main pga championship delivered higher 
than typical revenue in 2017 due to the location of the 
event and the type of product supplied, which will not 
be repeated in 2018. 
in the middle east & asia region revenue grew by £4m, 
with the project for the dubai world trade centre 
generating significant, but one off, sales revenue in 
the year.using an adjusted earnings figure, shown in the table 
below, and the year end number of shares for the full 
year period, the adjusted basic earnings per share 
figure was 3.5 pence.financial review continued 21

alternative performance measures
the group uses alternative performance measures 
such as adjusted ebitda, adjusted earnings per share 
and adjusted roce (as defined below), to allow the 
users of the financial statements to gain a clearer 
understanding of the underlying performance of the 
business.in the table above and due 
to the ipo in july 2017, the 31 december 2017 number 
of shares in issue has been used for both periods.the main risks identified by the board and the related controls and mitigation strategies are set out below.the repercussions of any such incident 
would almost certainly affect the group’s ability 
to win or retain business in the local geography 
and internationally, across all sectors in which 
arena operate.annual report & accounts 2017 35

directors’ report
review of business 
the chief executive’s review provides a review 
of the business, the group’s trading for the year 
to 31 december 2017 and an indication of future 
developments.going concern
based on the overall strength of the group’s balance 
sheet, including the availability of committed but 
undrawn banking facilities with expiry dates not before 
december 2019; and together with a review of its 
forecast future operating budgets and forecasts, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation that the group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.acquisition of the gld productions ltd business
on 1 february 2018 the group acquired the 
business and assets of gld productions ltd for 
total expected consideration of £0.9 million.auditors
each of the persons who is a director at the date of 
approval of this report confirms that:
• so far as the directors are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditor is 
unaware; and
• the directors have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the companies act 
2006. they are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.these three 
components account for 90% of the group’s revenue, 99% of the group’s ebitda and 
93% of the group’s total assets.the classification of these expenses 
affects the numbers presented on the income statement, the balance sheet and the 
cash flow statement.these financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the group operates.amendments to ias12 recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
the group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year.the core principle of ifrs 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods 
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services.all changes to these assets and liabilities 
that arise after the group gained control of the subsidiary are charged or credited to the post acquisition profit 
and loss account.finance costs/income
initial debt issue costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the 
facility.share options and other equity 
instruments
the selection of valuation models, such as the black–scholes model, and 
parameters used in order to determine the fair value of certain share awards 
requires judgement.annual report & accounts 2017 73
