the notes on pages 30 to 45 form an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.basis of consolidation and business combinations
the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries, as outlined in note 23.
subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control.if the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is less than the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, the difference is 
recognised as negative goodwill and is reflected directly in the statement of comprehensive income.estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.the term of the lease is the full 
lease period where there is a reasonable expectation at the inception of the lease that the tenant will not utilise the lease break clause.any subsequent qualifying capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period in 
which the expenditure is incurred and included in the book cost of the properties.operating leases
properties leased out under operating leases, where the group is the lessor, are included in investment property in the consolidated statement of 
financial position.an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate.when the group 
considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off.no corporation tax was incurred 
during the year (2016: nil) and cpml was dissolved on 30 may 2017.
the company is registered under the non-resident landlord scheme and is liable to uk taxation at a rate of 20% on net rental income from its 
investment properties.to the extent that the directors assess this to be material, 
the fair value of the share options are determined at the grant date and are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.3 operating segments
the group has adopted ifrs 8 “operating segments” which requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about 
components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“codm”) to allocate resources to the segments and to 
assess their performance.however, as the acquisition of the subsidiary entities was conditional on the company listing and, due to the combined nature of the fees 
payable, they have all been presented as listing costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.where the loan to value is 
less than 55% of the group’s gross portfolio value an interest rate of 1.85% over libor is charged, where the loan to value equals or exceeds 55% an 
interest rate of 2.75% over libor is charged.these disclosures include, where appropriate, consideration of the group’s investment properties which, whilst not constituting financial instruments as 
defined by ifrs, are considered by the board to be integral to the group’s overall risk exposure.the board produces regular reports on any tenant arrears which are monitored by the directors in 
order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.in order to mitigate liquidity risk the group aims to have sufficient cash 
balances (including the expected proceeds of any property sales) to ensure that the group is able to meet its obligations for a period of at least 12 
months.the group invests in properties which the directors believe will generate a combination of 
long-term growth in income and capital for shareholders.
