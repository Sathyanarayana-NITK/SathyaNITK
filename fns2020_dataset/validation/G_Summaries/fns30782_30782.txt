 " companies can depend on us 
to give them the comfort and 
confidence that comes with 
knowing their products comply 
with all relevant standards."• we saw an improved level of demand 
for testing activities in the minerals 
business.the board considers that the diverse nature of 
business lines and geographies in which the group operates 
significantly mitigates the impact that any of these scenarios 
might have on the group’s viability.examples include 
the opportunities provided by new markets and 
customers, a failure to innovate in terms of service 
offering and delivery, the challenge of radically new 
and different business models, and the failure to 
foresee the impact of, or adequately respond to and 
comply with, changing or new laws and regulations.systems functionality – a failure to define the right it 
strategies, maintain existing it systems or implement 
new it systems with the required functionality and 
which are fit for purpose, in each case to support 
the group’s growth, innovation and competitive 
customer offering.in the year, the group drew on facilities it had in place at 
31 december 2016. during the year us$100m of its existing 
bilateral term loan facility was repaid.to support this policy in action, all people working for or on 
behalf of intertek are required to sign our code of ethics upon 
joining the company or before commencing work on our behalf, in 
order to confirm their acceptance of the high standards expected 
of them in all business dealings.as such, 
our aim is to improve operational and natural resource efficiency 
in a consistent manner across all of our 1,000 sites, and to 
establish a global community of sustainability champions who 
share their site level knowledge and experience for the benefit 
of others.the nomination committee deliberated on a broad range of 
candidates to ensure individuals with wide-ranging experience, 
expertise and attributes were considered to support the existing 
skills on the board and to support the continued growth and 
success of the group.the board is responsible for 
ensuring the appropriateness and effectiveness of the group’s 
management and control framework in order to support the delivery 
the board is committed to the successful 
delivery of long-term sustainable growth 
and shareholder value which is 
underpinned by the highest standards 
of corporate governance.”

continued the board has established formal and transparent arrangements 
to apply the corporate reporting, risk management and internal 
control principles as set out in the code.in 
addition, andrew martin has extensive recent and relevant 
financial experience, particularly gained as the group finance 
director of compass group plc.during the year, the committee reviewed and considered the 
following areas of judgement to be exercised in the application of 
the accounting policies:
claims
from time to time the group is involved in various claims and 
lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of business.the committee reviewed the impairment consideration and 
calculations prepared by management considering the trading 
assumptions, the discount rates used as well as the sensitivities 
included by management, details of which are contained in 
note 9 to the financial statements.in the event that an engagement for non-audit services arises, 
the policy is designed to ensure that the external auditor is only 
appointed where it is considered to be the most suitable supplier 
of the service and the necessary prior approvals have been given 
in accordance with the policy.the committee reviews the balance between base salary and 
performance-related remuneration against the key objectives 
and targets so as to ensure performance is appropriately rewarded.for good leavers, awards will normally vest on the original 
vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.when 
considering the remuneration arrangements for the executive 
directors for the year ahead, the committee is informed of 
salary increases across the wider group.any shares purchased in this 
way may be held in treasury which, the directors believe, will 
provide the company with flexibility in the management of its 
share capital.where treasury shares are used to satisfy share 
awards, they will be classed as new issue shares for the purpose 
of the 10% limit on the number of shares that may be issued over 
a 10-year period under the relevant share plan rules.significant agreements – change of control
the company is not a party to significant agreements which 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following 
a takeover bid apart from a number of credit facilities with banks 
together with certain senior notes issued by the company.the 
total amount owing under such credit facilities and senior note 
agreements as at 31 december 2017 is shown in note 14 to the 
financial statements.these agreements contain clauses such 
that, in the event of a change of control, the company can offer 
to or must repay all such borrowings together with accrued 
interest, fees and other sums owing as required by the 
individual agreements.the rules of the company’s incentive plans contain clauses 
relating to a change of control resulting from a takeover and in 
such an event awards would vest subject to the satisfaction of 
any associated performance criteria.material interests in shares
up to 5 march 2018, being the latest practicable date before the 
publication of this report, the following disclosures of major 
holdings of voting rights have been made (and have not been

employment
information about the group’s employees, employment of 
disabled persons and employment practices is contained within 
the sustainability and csr report on pages 48 to 51. information on 
employee share schemes is in note 17 to the financial statements.responsibility statement of the directors 
in respect of the annual financial report
each of the directors, whose name and functions are listed on 
pages 68 and 69, confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the group and parent company financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the company’s 2017 annual report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service 
is completed, usually when the report of findings is issued.based on information 
currently available, the directors consider that the cost to the group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely 
to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the group in the foreseeable future.the timing of the cash outflow is uncertain, but 
is likely to be within one year.awards may be 
granted under the dsp to employees of the group (other than the executive directors of the company) selected by the remuneration 
committee over existing, issued ordinary shares of the company only.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditor's professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditor, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.going concern
in accordance with isas (uk) we report as follows:
reporting obligation outcome
we are required to report if we have anything material 
to add or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether 
the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of 
any material uncertainties to the group’s and the 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
