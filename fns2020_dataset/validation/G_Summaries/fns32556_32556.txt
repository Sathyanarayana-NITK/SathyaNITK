controls, including reviewing the group’s annual financial statements, 
considering the scope of the annual audit and the extent of the 
non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, advising on the
appointment of external auditors and reviewing the effectiveness  
of the systems and processes for the management of risk and the 
effective operation of the financial and internal control systems in 
place within the group.•  approved the remuneration and terms of engagement of the  
external auditors.the board has, however, delegated responsibility for 
review of the risk management methodology and effectiveness of

opinion
in our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 24 march 2017 and 
of the group’s loss for the period then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrss) 
as adopted by the european union and ifrss as issued by the international accounting standards board (iasb);
• the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with united kingdom generally accepted accounting 
practice, including frs101 “reduced disclosure framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.conclusions related to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of 
the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the financial statements and 
the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained within the 
strategic report, on page 27 .furthermore, for a sample of sites, we performed an assessment of the reasonableness of the forecast costs that 
underpin the cash flows used in the calculation of the provision.there is a risk that the judgements made by management in valuing the defined benefit pension liabilities 
including the use of assumptions on the discount rate, mortality assumption, inflation level, pension increase and 
measures of longevity may be overly optimistic.we have challenged management on the long range growth rates utilised in comparison to those used by relevant 
comparable groups and market reports on future waste volume growth.the transaction does not meet the definition of a business 
combination under ifrs 3 business combinations and as such,
falls outside the scope of that standard.the consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the  
sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred to  
the group, liabilities incurred by the group to the former owners  
of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree.if the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss  
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.debt and equity instruments issued by a group entity are classified as 
either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance 
of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial 
liability and an equity instrument.the £0.4 million of acquisition related expenditure in the 52 weeks 
ended 25 march 2016 includes £0.3 million in relation to the 
acquisition of phs chemical waste limited and the trading assets  
of enviroco limited’s sheffield-based hazardous waste business.the recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
