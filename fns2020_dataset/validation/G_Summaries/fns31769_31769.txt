group’s staff dedicated to end-user 
customer support, focusrite makes sure 
that the users of its products have the 
best possible experience.the strategic report has been approved 
by the directors and signed by order of 
the board.it is this team that has generated the 
strong growth over the last decade and it signals significant 
strength in depth within the group.the board has a schedule of matters reserved for its 
consideration which includes, but is not limited to, matters of 
strategy, risk management, consideration and approval of 
financial budgets, major capital expenditure decisions, 
acquisitions and disposals, approval of the interim and final 
results and the recommendation of any dividends.the board has arranged a schedule of meetings to consider 
strategy, performance and the framework of internal controls 
and will both support and challenge the management team to 
deliver the objectives set.the ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
annual report and accounts and the half-yearly reports remains 
with the board.following dave froker’s decision to retire at the end of 
2016, the nomination committee led the process to appoint his 
successor with the assistance of odgers berndtson, an 
international executive search firm.details of each director’s contractual arrangements, including 
notice periods, are included as part of the directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 37 to 41 and that information is 
incorporated by reference into the directors’ report.other than the general provisions of the 
articles of association and prevailing legislation, there are no 
specific restrictions on the size of a holding of the company’s 
share capital.the directors’ report has been approved by the board of 
directors on 21 november 2017.
signed on behalf of the board.accordingly, although not required to comply with schedule 8 of the large and medium-sized companies and groups 
(accounts and reports) regulations 2008 (the ‘regulations’), the company has used these regulations as guidance for presenting 
selected disclosures where it considers these to be relevant, helpful and appropriate.directors’ remuneration report focusrite plc annual report 2017 38
base salary
base salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually and determined taking account of individual performance, scope of 
responsibility, relative pay levels within the group and reference to external market data as referred to above.to the extent they elected to do so, the company made a matching award of shares 
(the ‘matching shares’).an award of 
options under the company’s enterprise management incentive plan (‘the emi plan’) was made to jeremy wilson prior to the 
company’s flotation on aim when he joined focusrite in september 2014. this emi plan award has three tranches, each in respect 
of a three-year performance period, running respectively to the end of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.these awards are worth a 
maximum of 100% of base salary at the time of grant and are based on the achievement of eps targets.our procedures included:
• control design: evaluating the group’s 
procedures for calculating the inventory 
provision;
• tests of details: comparing the cost of a 
sample of inventory items to after date sales to 
identify items sold at below cost.application of these standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements in the future.goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non‑ controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the amounts of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.interest income
interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably.3 significant accounting policies continued

strategic report governance financial statements
if vesting periods or other non‑ market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.a financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as at fvtpl upon initial recognition if:
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
• the financial asset forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and ias 39 ‘financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at fvtpl.for listed and unlisted equity investments classified as afs, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below 
its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.also included within central administration costs is the charge relating to 
the share option scheme (note 29) of £145,000 for the year ended 31 august 2017 (2016: £120,000).14 tax continued
