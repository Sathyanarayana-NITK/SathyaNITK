in order to improve operating performance 
and better align capacity with demand, 
the group commenced a restructuring 
of its uk tiles business in march 2017. the 
re‑ organisation will increase manufacturing 
flexibility, reduce inventory and involve the 
loss of around 90 jobs and has resulted in 
a charge of £2.3m.whilst the value of 
scheme assets rose by £38.5m in the year 
on the back of improving equity markets, 
the value of the liabilities increased by 
£45.5m, which was mainly due to a lower 
discount rate of 2.60% (2016: 3.55%).in the previous year, the total of £23.6m comprised outflows of £19.3m and 
£3.1m in respect of the acquisitions of croydex and abode respectively, together with 
£1.2m paid to the former shareholders of vado under the earn‑ out arrangement.the board then focused 
on an extreme but plausible scenario, similar to that 
encountered by the group following the global financial 
crisis of 2008/9, and considered the impact on its 
financial performance after taking mitigating actions.norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017 25

their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the code; and considering whether

the basis of the shareholders’ best interests.
