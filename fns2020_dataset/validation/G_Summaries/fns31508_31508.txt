continuing losses of the group or delays in the 
implementation of cost savings may lead to a lack 
of liquidity.additionally, 
the cost of onerous leases increased by 
£2.4m to £6.9m reflecting an increased 
number of branch closures year on year.our primary responsibility is, as 
always, safety – of our colleagues, 
our customers and of the 
equipment we hire – and making 
sure that hss is a safe place for 
people to work in and to hire from.this part of the annual report provides an overview of the group’s existing 
approach to corporate governance and how we continue to evolve our corporate 
governance structure(s) to better mitigate risk and ensure compliance with 
prevailing legislation on an ongoing basis.alan peterson

the main corporate governance issues 
addressed by the board or one of the 
four sub-committees of the board during 
the year were as follows:
strategic review
during 2017 , the board engaged with 
an independent party to work with hss 
management, to undertake the most 
extensive review of the business to date.looking ahead
the implementation of the findings from our 
strategic review and the new management 
team give me great confidence that we have 
assembled a strong operational team and an 
experienced board, both of which will drive 
the long-term success of the business.the 
principal purpose of this agreement is to ensure that the company 
and its subsidiaries are capable of carrying on their business 
independently of exponent and the exponent shareholders and 
that any transactions and relationships between them are at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms.roles and responsibilities
the committee has responsibility for overseeing the financial 
reporting and internal financial and risk management controls of 
the company, as well as maintaining an appropriate relationship 
with the external auditor and reporting its findings and 
recommendations to the board.the committee assesses that the approach adopted is reasonable.risk management and internal controls
an overview of the company’s approach to risk, risk management 
and internal controls through 2017, together with a summary of 
the principal risks facing the group, is provided on pages 14 to 17.
during 2017 the committee reviewed the overall risk management 
and internal control framework, the work and role of the internal 
audit team and the underlying process for capturing and reporting 
risk and control data.the culture of our business means that we seek to ensure we 
have the same approach to reward for all our colleagues where 
appropriate and therefore have designed a reward framework 
which we can cascade consistently and one which is relevant  
not only for our executive directors but also for our senior team 
who participate in the annual bonus and the long term incentive 
plan (ltip).the annual bonus will 
be subject to core hire rental revenue growth (30% of the overall 
opportunity), adjusted ebitda performance (30% of the overall 
opportunity), net leverage ratio (30% of the overall opportunity) 
and a reduction in riddors (10% of the overall opportunity).the committee is mindful of the impact of 
the refinancing on the group’s three-year plan numbers and has 
therefore decided to wait until this has been agreed before setting 
the targets for the 2018 ltip.the remuneration committee meets as often as is deemed 
necessary, but in any event at least three times a year.the 
directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of 
the financial statements contained therein.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified.our audit work in respect of this area included the identification and testing of the 
operating effectiveness of key controls in respect of the existence and value of hire 
stock, including the authorisation of additions, the use of unique asset identification 
numbers, and the reconciliation of the fixed asset registers to the accounting records.using data analytical and reperformance techniques we recalculated the depreciation, 
additions and disposals in the fixed asset registers for the current year, and reconciled 
this to the charge included in the accounting ledgers.we utilised our 
own valuation specialists, particularly around the appropriateness of the discount  
rates used by the directors comparing this against the cost of capital for the group  
and other comparable companies in the industry.notes to the consolidated

dividends
dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements in the period in which they are 
declared by the company.the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial 
position date.both employees and employers are 
required to make contributions, with the employer’s contributions for each employee determined by the level of contribution made by 
the employee and the employee’s length of service within the group or subsidiary company.in the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based  
on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.the capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included in liabilities in the statement of 
financial position and analysed between current and non-current amounts.fair values 
reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the group entity and counterparty 
where appropriate.as branches and distribution centres rolled into the ndec, there was a period of increased costs due to the operation of both the new 
and old models in parallel.based on this viu modelling and impairment testing, the directors do not consider the goodwill and indefinite life brands assets carried 
in the balance sheet at 30 december 2017, for any of the cgus, to be impaired.therefore, the fair value of the award in aggregate is determined by reference to 
the market value of the original ltip share awards at the date of grant.forward-looking statements
