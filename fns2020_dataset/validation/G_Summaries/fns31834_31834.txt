the group has not recognised 
the potential net deferred tax asset of 
£1,293k related to these accumulated 
losses and other timing differences 
in the current year.within cash flow from operations, 
the loss for the year was offset by the 
collection of the large trade debtor 
balance that existed at the start of 
the year.the appetite for each risk 
is also established to ensure that 
the appropriate level of mitigation 
and monitoring is planned into 
the ongoing oversight process.in 
addition, the group maintains 
manufacturing relationships with a very 
small number of contract manufacturers, 
all of whom are currently based in the 
european union – which it considers to be a 
relatively safe environment to prevent the 
leakage of intellectual property.to 
mitigate the impact of the loss of individual 
team members, systems are in place to 
ensure common processes and clear 
documentation of all r&d findings so that 
responsibilities for projects can transfer 
with as little disruption as possible.directors and their interests

1. nature of operations and general information
plant impact plc is the group’s ultimate parent company.the projections take into account the new business 
opportunities highlighted in the strategic report, the timing and quantum of which will affect the group’s cash requirements, 
which are continually monitored by the board.the directors also noted that the group has demonstrated its 
capability in securing contractual arrangements and maintaining customer relationships which increase the probability of 
improving revenues and that it has recently raised additional funds through the placing of new shares prior to the year end.amortisation periods are 
determined according to the expected useful economic life of the product.the classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial recognition.share-based payments
the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award.revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.in cases where the technical feasibility is felt to have been proven already in the research 
phase then the early stage development phase will be skipped and the project will migrate straight to the late stage 
development phase.the achievement of the performance conditions has been modelled and an estimated life of the options has been calculated.these products are currently generating commercial revenues in europe, the 
americas, middle east and africa and as such there is no indication of impairment of the carrying value of related development 
costs.during the year, goodwill and development costs relating to the pest control segment were tested for impairment in 
accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets.these options are subject to holding conditions and vest on performance conditions as set out in the directors’ 
remuneration report on page 42. the fair value of standard options is calculated at the time of grant using a trinomial model.amortisation of the fair value resulted in a charge for the year of £753k (2016: £624k).the group’s policy on investment of surplus funds limits the placing of deposits to institutions with strong 
credit ratings.in addition to the above criterion, the options are also subject to the following condition:
• if the share price has declined more than 30% below the share price hurdle which triggered the vesting of the option, the 
vesting of the option should be delayed until the share price achieves that share price hurdle for at least 20 consecutive 
dealing days.
