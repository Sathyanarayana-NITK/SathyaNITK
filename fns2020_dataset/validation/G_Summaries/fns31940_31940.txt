as set out in note 2 to the financial 
statements, revenue increased by 1 1% 
to £71.6m (2016: £64.5m) and underlying 
operating profit increased by 13% to 
£8.0m (2016: £7 .1m).this is comprised of an estimated rdec 
credit in respect of the current year of 
£5.2m (2016: £5.4m), together with £1.4m 
arising from the routine amendment of 
open applications as a result of further 
analysis of the qualifying expenditure 
incurred.in addition, having been approached 
by the landlord of leased premises at our 
midlands technical centre, an agreement 
was reached to sell and lease back a 
property which had been built on the 
site, together with an extension in the 
term of the overall lease.this was as a result of the uk referendum 
vote to leave the eu on 23 june 2016, 
which had a favourable impact on 
revenue during the year, but a marginal 
impact on profit.in addition to any 
formal training, this might be through 
taking part in one of our various internal 
strategic- or improvement-oriented 
projects, working on a customer project 
at a different technical centre or on-site 
at a client organisation, or by going on an 
international assignment.internal procedures 
are in place to ensure that the technical content of our 
output is of high quality and meets client requirements 
without infringing the rights of others, within time and 
cost targets.the board has 
considered the risk appetite and profile 
of the group in this context, and has 
determined that this remains appropriate 
for the group as a whole.further research 
with widespread and increasing concern over the 
health consequences of nanoparticle emissions, the 
european commission is supporting ricardo and 
other researchers, including the pmp group, in further 
investigations into measurement technologies, 
systems and methodologies that might support a 
lowering of the current particle size threshold.in addition to meeting external 
packaging envelope restrictions, the pack needs to 
be engineered to be capable of securely housing 
the individual cell pouches, while also allowing 
for expansion and contraction, and providing the 
requisite thermal management of the cells through its 
cooling system.the final design of the battery module combined 
the mounting of the individual cells into a backing 
plate assembly, which doubled as part of the thermal 
management system, maintaining the desired 
operating temperature of the individual cells.i am pleased to 
advise that bill spencer joined the board on 24 april 201 7 and it is intended that he will be 
appointed chair of the audit committee at the close of the agm in november 201 7 .the board agenda is set by 
the chairman in consultation with the chief executive officer and 
the company secretary.sir terry morgan is primarily responsible for leading the board and 
ensuring its effectiveness.the committee meeting in september 2017 carried out a full 
review of the year-end consolidated financial statements and of 
the audit, based upon reports prepared by the chief financial 
officer and the external auditors, together with taking into account 
any significant accounting policies, any changes to them and any 
significant estimates or judgements.the risk rating of a contract is categorised into five levels, with 
one being the lowest and five being the highest.the committee reviewed, challenged and evaluated the 
significant judgements taken and was satisfied that both the level 
of capitalisation during the year and the carrying value of the 
development assets was appropriate.the directors encourage the 
participation of all shareholders, including private investors, at the 
agm and as a matter of policy the level of proxy votes (for, against 
and vote withheld) lodged on each resolution is declared at the 
meeting and displayed on the company’s website.taking shareholders’ views into account
when considering ricardo’s remuneration policy and its implementation, 
the committee is always keen to ensure that it takes into account the 
views and opinions of all the relevant stakeholders in the business.in the spirit of continuous improvement and in order to ensure that our 
remuneration policy continues fully to support achievement of business 
objectives and delivery of value to shareholders, the committee will 
continue to review our policy periodically in the context of the changing 
business environment.for awards made in the years ending 30 june 2016 and 2017 .the targets applicable to the tsr portion of these awards will 
be the same as those which applied to awards granted last year.dividends
the directors recommend the payment of a final ordinary share 
dividend for the year ended 30 june 2017 of 13.88 pence per 
ordinary share on 17 november 2017 to shareholders who are on 
the register of members at the close of business on 27 october 
2017 , which together with the interim dividend paid on 6 april 
2017 makes a total of 19.3 pence per ordinary share for the year 
(2016: 18.1 pence).none of these are considered to be significant in terms of 
their likely impact on the business of the group as a whole.where management have made an assessment of anticipated 
recovery of overspends and scope increases within the contract 
accounting, we have considered the appropriateness of this 
judgement, challenging the evidence provided and reading 
correspondence with third parties to support the position taken.we considered the 
position taken by management to be appropriate.further details are given in note 20.
 
 retirement benefit obligations
 the group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that provides 
benefits to a number of current and former employees.this scheme 
is closed to new entrants and the accrual of future benefits for active 
members ceased at the end of february 2010. the value of the deficit 
is particularly sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s assets, 
discount rates and actuarial assumptions related to mortality.provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the 
relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the group’s liability.acquisition-related expenditure 
is incurred by the group to effect a business combination, including 
the costs associated with the integration of acquired businesses 
together with dual-running costs incurred during a transitional

future commitment in respect of operating leases which expire in

credit (‘rdec’) scheme have been restated.the last triennial valuation of the rgpf was completed with an effective date of 5 april 2014. at that date, the assets of the fund had a market 
value of £96.3m and were sufficient to cover 79% of the benefits that had accrued to members when assessed on the trustees' prudent funding 
basis.
