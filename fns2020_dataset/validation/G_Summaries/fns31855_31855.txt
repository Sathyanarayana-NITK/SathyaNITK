of their knowledge:
• the company financial statements, which have been

accepted accounting practice (united kingdom accounting 
standards, comprising frs 101 “reduced disclosure framework”, 
and applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;
• the group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the group; and
• the directors’ report on pages 55 to 57, together with 
the our financials and our risks sections on pages 22 to 27 
and pages 15 to 19 respectively of the strategic report, 
include a fair review of the development and performance

specified procedures performed over another chinese operation, which were performed by 
the component auditor, the group engagement team performed all of the audit procedures.the directors are 
responsible for the other information.our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.(ca06)

audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the strategic report and directors’ report.other code provisions

and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company 
obtained in the course of performing our audit.a further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the frc’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment 
with the relevant provisions of the code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding 
of the group and company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit.71 annual report and accounts 2017 abcam plc

goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.foreign currencies
for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed 
in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company and the reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements.such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.dividend distribution
dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, when paid.the recent historical 
trend showed a very low level of actual write-offs, thereby resulting in a revision of the expected collectability of the group’s debtor
