 – strategic alignment – having regard to the risk appetite 
of the company and alignment to the company’s long-term 
strategic goals;

with appropriate reward for superior performance; and
 – avoiding the creation of incentives that will encourage 
excessive risk taking or unsustainable company performance.the remuneration committee recognises 
the need to maintain flexibility in the benefits

able to support the objective of attracting and 
retaining key personnel in order to deliver the 
company’s strategy.the committee will apply a holding period 
of two years post vesting to the ltip unless
