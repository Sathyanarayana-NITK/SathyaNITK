oct technology dominates the retinal scanning and imaging 
arena, but the longer term development partnerships we have 
with medical diagnostic companies in the areas of cardiovascular 
disease and cancer detection are now moving to the prototype 
and early commercial model stage, with the prospect of new 
product launches in the near future.the products supplied into this market span the complete 
breadth of the company’s technology portfolio.the adjusted effective rate of tax was 25.2% (2016: 27.3%), 
the reduction caused by a number of factors including a lower 
applicable corporate tax rate in the uk, tax deductions being 
available on intangibles on recent us acquisitions and certain 
one off effects in the prior year.the effective rate of tax of 
29.4% (2016: 30.2%) was higher than the adjusted effective 
rate because of the effect of the interest charge on deferred 
consideration which is not subject to tax, and the restructuring 
and acquisition costs being incurred in the uk which has a lower 
tax rate than the overall rate for the group.these 
measures are used to illustrate the impact of non-recurring and 
non-trading items on the company’s financial results.aerospace & defence (a&d)
a&d revenue was £34.9 million, up 74.5% on last year, 
benefitting from the full year effect of the two acquisitions in 
fy16 and the acquisition of stingray in fy17.the majority of this growth was driven by a strong 
performance in our optical coherence tomography (“oct”) 
market driven largely by our customers’ development cycles.as a result of two key customers delaying the delivery of product 
from existing orders, kent periscopes did not reach its threshold 
for the first tranche of its earn-out to be triggered.staff
the group workforce increased from 755 at 30 september 
2016 to 823 at the end of september 2017, an increase of 68. 
this is a net position and therefore reflects both the work the 
business has done in driving efficiency improvements and the

we reviewed the underlying transactions, tested the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired together with the intangible assets identified as part of the purchase price allocation 
and reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements.we believe that profit before tax is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the entity, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.conclusions relating to going concern
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which isas (uk) require us to report to you when: 
•  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or 
•  the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.responsibilities for the financial statements and
the audit
responsibilities of the directors for the financial 
statements
as explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on pages 31 and 32, the directors are

notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 september 2017
1. general information
gooch & housego plc (the “company”) is incorporated and 
domiciled in the united kingdom.the group has 
facilities in the united kingdom, germany and the united states.ifrs 16 leases 
this new standard will apply to the group for the first time in the 
year ending 30 september 2020. following adoption of the 
standard, management expect all of the group’s operating leases 
to be reclassified onto the balance sheet.the excess of the costs of 
a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.the financing charge 
which arises on the discounted consideration between the 
acquisition date and the date of payment is included within 
finance costs.c. subsidiaries 
the results and financial position of subsidiaries that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
•  income and expenses for each income statement are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 
transactions); and
•  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity.on consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and  
of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity.intangible assets
a. goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business 
combination over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired business.capitalised software costs are amortised using the straight 
line method over their estimated useful lives of up to 5 years 
and charged to administration in the income statement.current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year using rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and 
any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.in 
accordance with ifrs 2 the fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as 
an expense in the income statement.incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.b. long term contracts 
revenue is recognised on long term contracts by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance 
sheet date.notes to the financial statements

based specialist designer and manufacturer of high performance optical and opto-mechanical subsystems for demanding defence 
and commercial applications.in accordance with ifrs 2 the fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in the income statement.if the amount of 
estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is 
recorded directly in equity.
