matthew will formally replace 
mark on the board with effect from 1 january 2018.
outlook 
we have delivered another significant improvement in 
business performance in the year helped by the acquisition  
of the brand architekts and major new product launches in 
our manufacturing business.the convergence of a number of macro trends has created 
a significant and demonstrable opportunity for smaller more 
agile companies to create and profitably grow well-crafted 
and well positioned brands in the personal care and beauty 
sector.it offers us the opportunity to further develop our knowledge 
and capabilities in e-commerce which we believe will be 
critical to the further development of our owned brands 
business in the years ahead.pr and marketing agencies were consolidated across the 
portfolio in the course of the year which has led to better 
quality output at lower cost.we have put in place dedicated resource to grow this area 
and are pleased in the course of the year to have opened new 
distribution channels for a number of our brands in france, 
netherlands, austria and chile.revenue growth was 36% at £74.3m (2016: £54.5m), 
and 8% excluding the acquisition of the brand 
architekts which completed on 27 june 2016.  
the weakness of sterling has increased sales  
revenue by £3.4m, with £1.8m of this coming from  
us dollar denominated sales and £1.6m from the euro,  
so revenue growth on a constant currency basis would 
have been 31%, and 2% excluding the acquisition.underlying operating profit is shown before charges for 
share-based payments, with a provision made of £1.76m 
(2016: £0.22m), reflecting the share price appreciation 
in the year and the impact on the accounting valuation 
of the phantom shares awarded at the closing share- strategic report

price of 395p (2016: 180p).the exceptional item of £0.34m in the current period relates 
to “one off” costs incurred in the acquisition of the brand 
architekts ltd. in 2016 there was an exceptional credit of 
£0.65m relating to the closure to future accrual of the defined 
benefit pension scheme.at the reporting date, 
the yields on bonds of all types were lower than they were at 
25 june 2016. this has resulted in lower discount rates being 
adopted for accounting purposes compared to last year, 
which has been coupled with an increase in expectations of 
long term inflation, with the combination materially increasing 
the fair value of the scheme liabilities, with the strong 
investment return performance only partially mitigating.accordingly, we continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and accounts.during the year a 
number of employee workshops and briefings have taken 
place to engage employees in the delivery of ‘building a 
better swallowfield’.the group discloses on and is assessed on the ecovadis csr 
platform giving assurance of meeting the highest standards of 
sustainable procurement, business practices environment and 
labour practices.a statement made pursuant to the modern slavery act 2015 
setting out the steps the group has taken to ensure that 
slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply 
chains or in any part of our business has been incorporated 
within our ethical policy, and can be found on our website.the group achieved the mandatory 
requirement under the esos scheme to comply by december 
2015.  the report continues to assist the group in identifying 
any further savings opportunities.the board is accountable 
to the company’s shareholders for good governance and this 
statement describes how the principles of good governance 
set out in the uk corporate governance code, published 
by the financial reporting council are applied within 
the company.he was a member of the accounting standards

of london finance & investment group p.l.c., western selection p.l.c., heartstone inns limited, and some

strategic report
the strategic report set out on pages 10-35 provides a fair 
review of the group’s business for the year ended june 2017.  
it also explains the objectives and strategy of the group,  
its competition and the markets in which it operates,  
the principal risks and uncertainties it faces, employee 
information, the group’s financial position, key performance 
indicators and likely future developments of the business.the financial

of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of 
the profit or loss of the group for that period.in accordance with ifrss as adopted 
by the european union, goodwill is not being amortised but is 
being tested for impairment annually.our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.annual report & accounts 2017

matters on which we are required to report under the companies act 2006
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.the group financial statements consolidate those of the 
parent company and all of its subsidiaries as of june 2017. the 
parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the subsidiary.the assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the statement of financial position date.for cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the 
liability needs to be re-measured at the end of each reporting 
period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair 
value recognised in the profit or loss.the size of the deficit is sensitive to the market value of the 
underlying scheme investments and the actuarial assumptions 
which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the 
discount rate used in assessing the liabilities, mortality rates, 
and other demographic factors.there have been a number of options granted during the course of the financial year to 24 june 2017 with further details  
given below:
the company has used the qca-irs option valuer tm (based on the black-scholes-merton based option pricing model) to 
calculate the fair value of the outstanding share options.the first 50% of the award is linked to certain share price targets and the remaining 50% is linked to earning per share targets.to the extent that both of the performance conditions are met at the end of the three-year performance cycle, then the options 
can be exercised at nil cost.annual report & accounts 2017 – 73 –
