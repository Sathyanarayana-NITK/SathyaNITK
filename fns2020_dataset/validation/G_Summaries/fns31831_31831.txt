of a uk listed company, excluding the chairman, should comprise 
non-executive directors determined by the board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from relationships or 
circumstances which may affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors’ judgement.the anonymity of all respondents was ensured 
throughout the process in order to promote the open and frank 
exchange of views.the key areas of recommendation set out in the 
report resulting in actions agreed by the directors are set out 
below and will be monitored by the board over the next year.committee performance evaluation
during the year, the board appointed an independent specialist 
corporate governance consultancy, lintstock, to conduct a formal 
externally facilitated evaluation of the performance of the board, 
its committees, the directors and the chairman in compliance 
with the code.after the year end, the committee considered the outcome of the performance evaluations when discussing the effectiveness 
of the non-executive directors seeking re-election at the annual general meeting 2017.  governance report

audit committee report
dear shareholder,
i am pleased to introduce the audit committee 
report for the year ended 31 july 2017, which 
outlines the activities of the committee 
during the year.the policy is in line with the new eu audit directive and 
regulation which states that the total non-audit fees for any 
financial year should not exceed 70% of the average of the 
external audit fee over the last three financial years.the company has a group-wide code of conduct and anti-bribery 
and corruption policy.the committee retains the discretion to 
vary the level of bonus paid away from 
the formulaic outcome to reflect overall 
company and individual performance.common award terms
the committee will operate the ltip and dsbp in accordance 
with the respective rules, the policy set out above and the listing 
rules where relevant.the assumptions used for these charts are as follows:
levels of performance assumptions
fixed pay all scenarios > total fixed pay comprises base salary, benefits and pension
 > base salary – effective as at 1 august 2017
 > benefits – as set out in the single figure table for the 2016/17 year
 > 15% of base salary pension contributions
variable pay below threshold performance > no payout under the abp
 > no vesting under the ltip
in line with expectations > 60% of the maximum potential payout under the abp 
 > 25% vesting under the ltip , assuming awards equivalent to 150% and 
125% of base salary are granted to the ceo and the cfo, respectively
maximum performance > 100% of the maximum potential payout under the abp (i.e.when a good leaver leaves holding 
unvested ltip awards, the award will vest taking into account the 
extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied 
and, unless the committee determines otherwise, the period of 
time that has elapsed between grant and the date of leaving as a 
proportion of the vesting period.statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the group 
although pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group 
are taken into account to ensure the relationship between the pay 
of executive directors and employees remains appropriate, the 
committee does not consult with employees when formulating 
the policy.in addition to the stretching performance conditions set out above, for awards to vest, the committee must be satisfied with the 
overall financial performance of the company over the performance period.results and dividend
the group’s results for the year are shown in the statement 
of comprehensive income on page 98.
an interim dividend of 1.35 pence per share was paid to 
shareholders on 4 may 2017 and the directors are recommending 
a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 july 2017 
of 2.80 pence per share.the directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website.during the year the group recognised revenue of £185.1 million
