developments during the year 
  during the year zotefoams began working on 
improvements to its risk management processes as 
well as the tools and guidelines to achieve this goal.they have also undertaken 
a sensitivity analysis over the key trading assumptions 
and considered the potential financial and operational 
impacts of the principal risks and uncertainties set out 
on pages 25 to 29. 
on the basis of this and other matters considered and 
reviewed by the directors during the year, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the five-year period.the group has appropriate contingency plans in  
place in the event of the failure of certain major pieces 
of equipment.the group has a hedging policy, which is approved 
by the board.the last triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme is 
as at 5 april 2017 and the outcome of this is still being 
considered.4.

topics, but there is always a discussion at one of the 
meetings each year to consider the activities of the 
committee during the year and areas for improvement.these included improving the 
succession plans of both the board and the group’s 
senior management, redesigning the risk management 
process and utilising more ‘in flight’ reviews to enhance 
the effectiveness of the board.zotefoams plc annual report 2017 48
annual report on remuneration
statement of implementation of the directors’ remuneration policy in 2018 (unaudited)
base salary and annual bonus
due to the previous directors’ remuneration policy providing a base remuneration below the market for the 
executive directors, upon approval of the new directors’ remuneration policy at the 2017 agm, the executive 
directors’ base salaries were increased, effective 1 april 2017 , by 6% to £238,500 per annum for the group ceo, 
d b stirling and by 9% to £156,500 for the group cfo, g c mcgrath.the total award vesting is the sum of the awards for tsr and eps.none of the committee members are involved in the day-to-day management of the 
business.in 2017 , the remuneration committee considered the following matters:
  completing a wholesale review of the remuneration strategy for the executive team and finalising the creation 
of the new directors’ remuneration policy, which included consulting with a number of the group’s largest 
shareholders; 
  the directors’ remuneration report for 2016 and relevant matters; 
  the annual bonuses for the executive team and the employees; 
  the grant of hmrc approved share options; 
  the grant of awards under the long-term incentive plan and the deferred bonus share plan and the vesting  
of awards made in 2014 under the long-term incentive plan; 
  the salary review of the executive team and the company secretary; 
  evaluating its effectiveness, in particular in formulating the new directors’ remuneration policy and the services 
provided by the remuneration consultant; 
  bonus arrangements for the uk workforce; 
  considering new rules for the long-term incentive plan, the deferred bonus share plan and the annual bonus 
plan;
  reviewing pension matters for the uk workforce; and
  performance targets to be used for the 2018 directors’ annual bonus and long-term incentive plan awards.for further information on the 
performance of the entity refer to the strategic report.we designed audit procedures at group and 
significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk 
of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or 
through collusion.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements.the company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the companies act 2006 from presenting the company profit and loss account.as a consequence, the directors believe that the group is well placed to manage its business risks.zotefoams plc annual report 2017 76

2.4 derivative financial instruments
the group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, financing and investment 
activities.the fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the statement of financial position date, being the present value of the quoted 
forward price.development costs previously recognised  
as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.for loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.the liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the end of the reporting period, less the fair value of plan assets.deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.lease rentals amounting to £106k (2016: £66k) and £377k (2016: £110k) relating to the lease of machinery and property, respectively, are included  
in the income statement (note 22).zotefoams plc annual report 2017 92
