in the markets where the group operates.we concluded that the wacc discount rates, 
ltgr, customer retention rates and cash flow 
forecasts used by management in the 
impairment assessment are within a reasonable 
range as at 31 december 2017.

would lead to a revision of the amortisation 
periods applied for purchased intangible assets.we assessed the accounting of the business combinations for 
compliance with ifrs 3 ‘business combinations’.in assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements, 
and to make sure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts 
in the financial statements, of the 88 reporting components of the group, we 
selected 25 components covering entities headquartered within the united 
kingdom, united states of america, italy, france and sri lanka, which represent 
the principal business units within the group.for these 
components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and 
testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations, to respond to 
any potential risks of material misstatement to the group financial statements.we have nothing to report in this regard.the implementation of ifrs 9 will not have a significant impact on the results of 
the group.on the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the assets and 
liabilities acquired.risk committees maintain an ongoing watch over 
these risks and the associated policy frameworks to protect the group against potentially severe volatility in 
the sovereign debt markets.in addition, the group’s ccps and certain other 
subsidiary companies are required to maintain a 
level of liquidity (consistent with regulatory 
requirements) to ensure the smooth operation of 
their respective markets and to maintain 
operations in the event of a single or multiple 
market stress event or member failure.the table below analyses the group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
