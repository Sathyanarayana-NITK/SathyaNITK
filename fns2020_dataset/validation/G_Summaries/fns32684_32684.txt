throughout the year we 
implemented a number of changes to the pricing models and 
added further personalisation to our content.the total remuneration 
payable for the 8ball acquisition was £4.0 million in cash and 
£10.1 million in share-based payments with the remainder of 
£0.9 million relating to the infiapps second year earn-out 
payment.the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at 
the year end is £17.4 million (2016: £5.6 million) with the increase 
of £10.8 million and unwinding of interest of £1.0 million being 
recognised in the profit or loss account.the ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the annual report and the half-yearly 
report remains with the board as a whole.john le poidevin, as a fellow of the institute of chartered 
accountants in england and wales and former audit partner 
and chair of other public company audit committees, is considered 
to have recent and relevant financial experience.financial reporting and significant financial judgements
set out below are the significant issues considered by the 
audit committee and discussed with the external auditor in 
relation to the financial statements and how these were then 
subsequently addressed.as a result of this review, the committee decided that its 
previous policy was still, in the main, appropriate for the 2017/18 
financial year and for the foreseeable future.as disclosed in the remuneration report in respect of the 
financial year ending 31 august 2016, due to transaction activity during the previous financial year and then close periods, it was 
not possible to grant the planned awards; therefore, the award made in the year comprised both the 2016/17 award and the 
award carried over from 2015/16.disclosures to auditor
the directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor 
is unaware, and each director has taken steps that ought to 
have been taken as a director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
company’s auditor is aware of that information.under 
that law, and as required by the aim rules for companies, the 
directors have elected to prepare the group financial statements 
in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(“ifrss”) as adopted by the european union (“eu”).key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.the accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised, and 
the related player liabilities, is dependent on the effectiveness 
of the systematic and manual financial controls in relation to 
player liabilities, calculation of bonuses, jackpots and prizes 
granted to players, cash and bank reconciliations.as a result of this review management determined that the 
weaker than expected social gaming market had an adverse 
effect on the projected value in use of that social gaming cash 
generating unit and consequently these intangible assets have 
been written down to their assessed value in use.key audit matters continued annual report and financial statements 2017 stride gaming plc 33
matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the companies (jersey) law 1991 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• 
proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• 
the consolidated financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.responsibilities of directors 
as explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, 
and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.the cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree.distribution costs
distribution costs represent the costs of delivering the service to the customer and primarily consist of processing and royalty 
fees, promotional and advertising costs together with gaming and other regulatory costs, all of which are recognised on an accruals 
basis.impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the 
net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.notes forming part of the financial statements continued

deferred tax 
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.deferred tax is charged or 
credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity through other comprehensive income.where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the profit or loss account is charged with the fair value 
of goods and services received or, in the case of an asset, recorded within the appropriate classification.available-for-sale investment
the group holds 24.25% (2016: 24.25%) in the equity share capital of qsb gaming limited, a company incorporated in alderney 
and an operator of online casino and bingo gaming sites in the spanish market.further details in relation to key estimates and judgements are set out in note 23.

the group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £355,000 (2016: £401,000) in respect of losses amounting to £2,110,000 
(2016: £2,004,000) that can be carried forward against future taxable income.the directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions which would cause the 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.as a result of this review the group determined that the weaker than expected social gaming market had an 
adverse effect on the projected value in use and consequently the intangible assets have been written down to their value in use.the contingent remuneration arose as a result of the 8ball games limited acquisition in the prior year and the infiapps acquisition 
in the year ended 31 august 2015, of £4,036,000 and £932,000 respectively.included in the above movement in deferred tax liability is a release of £749,000 of the deferred 
tax liability arising on the acquisition of infiapps as a result of the impairment of certain intangible assets in the year.general objectives, policies and processes
the board has overall responsibility for the determination of the group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst 
retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the 
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the group’s finance function.the group’s policy in this case is to allow the subsidiary 
to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own operations in that currency.
