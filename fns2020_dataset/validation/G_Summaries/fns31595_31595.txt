of ordinary shares, adjusted for any potential dilutive impact of the 
assumed conversion of the employee equity-settled share-based

operating in a dynamic and continually volatile environment requires 
a flexible and responsive risk management process that can match 
the pace of change and provide management with a concise view 
of the group’s risk profile at any point in time.those identified have targeted development plans based on their career

health and safety
due to the nature of our industry, the 
group will always be exposed to the 
risk of a health and safety incident 
en route to a destination, in the 
accommodation or during an excursion.we continue to rebalance our destination mix and add new destinations to 
our portfolio, thereby mitigating the impact of geopolitical events
 > we have developed a hotel security framework, which defines a set of minimum 
security standards that should be operational in our hotels.it also reviews the interests of candidates prior to making 
recommendations to the board for the appointment of new directors.the below sets out progress in respect of 
the action points identified following last year’s internal evaluation:
outputs from 2016 evaluation
areas of focus identified: progress:
the format and quality of board papers should continue 
to be developed to shift the emphasis from reporting 
past events to highlighting important matters that 
require the board’s guidance.during the year the nominations 
committee held six scheduled meetings and spent more time looking at succession 
planning (see nominations committee report on pages 78 to 79]for more details).this is 
fully described in the risk management section on pages 54 to 59.
the group’s internal control and risk management systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.some of their keys responsibilities are: 
 > monitoring the integrity of the annual, half-year and quarterly 
results statements, including reviewing the significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them; 
 > reviewing the company’s internal financial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems; 
 > monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal audit function; 
 > establishing and overseeing the company’s relationship with 
its external auditors, including monitoring their effectiveness 
and independence; and
 > monitoring matters raised pursuant to the company’s 
whistleblowing arrangements.corporate governance report

1  the frc stated that the scope of their review was based on the company’s fy16 annual report 
& accounts and was conducted by staff of the frc who have an understanding of the relevant 
legal and accounting framework.as part of the ongoing in-destination compliance programme, the 
committee chair and group general counsel & company secretary 
visited cyprus and turkey and met with key business partners to 
receive first-hand feedback in respect of the company’s general 
governance and compliance practices in-destination.the principal responsibility of the committee is 
to make recommendations to the board on all new appointments to 
the board, as well as board balance and composition.in accordance with its articles, the company has granted third-party 
indemnities, to the extent permitted by law, to each director and the 
group company secretary, which were in force during the financial 
year and up to the date of signing this report.employees who hold shares under the thomas cook baye or vested 
shares under any of the company’s executive share plans, are sent a 
form of instruction by the relevant trustee in respect of any general 
meetings of the company, so that they may instruct the trustee to 
vote on their behalf.an affected share notice can, if it so specifies, have the 
effect of depriving the registered holder of the right to attend, vote 
and speak at general meetings which they would otherwise have 
had as a consequence of holding such shares.variable remuneration 
is a combination of both short and long-term incentives which are 
strongly linked to the rigorous execution of the strategy.this includes consideration of: 
 > salary increases for the general employee population;
 > overall spend on annual bonus;
 > participation levels in the annual bonus and any long-term 
incentive plans;
 > company-wide benefits (including pension); and
 > any other relevant factors as determined by the committee
in order to take into account the views of the general employee 
population when formulating executive director pay policy, the 
committee may review information provided by the hr function and 
feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.annual report on directors’ remuneration

deferred bonus plan (dbp)
under the dbp, one third of any bonus payment made to executive directors under the group bonus plan is deferred into shares for a period 
of two years on a compulsory basis.the dbp awards shown in the previous table represent one third of the fy15 bonus and fy16 bonus 
respectively.phase 2 relates to the impairment of 
financial assets and requires the calculation of impairment on an expected loss basis rather than the current incurred loss basis.ifrs 17 
establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope 
of the standard.actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise 
within the statement of comprehensive income and expense.the costs that we have separately disclosed in relation to these programmes include the cost of external professional advice and 
redundancies, as well as the cost of dedicated personnel (both external consultants and internal employees) assigned to new operating 
model projects.reassessment of contingent consideration
in december 2016, the group announced its intention to acquire full control of its uk retail store network, following notification by 
the co-operative group (‘the co-op’) of the decision to exercise its option over its stake in their uk retail joint venture.the fuel pricing assumption 
is primarily driven by the fuel hedges in place and the forward fuel curve at the time that the budget is set.the directors consider that the carrying amounts of these assets approximate to their fair value.for further details refer to note
