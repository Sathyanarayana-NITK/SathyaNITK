during the year the risk committee was reconstituted, with a change in the membership.the role and responsibilities of the committee
the company board is ultimately responsible for the group’s risk management framework.the board regularly reviews the group’s key risks and to support the discharge of this 
responsibility, in addition to the audit committee, the board established the risk 
committee in 2014. 
the purpose of the risk committee (the committee) is to identify, measure, track, mitigate, 
and manage risks faced by the group over time with the intention of exposing threats to be 
mitigated and opportunities to be exploited.after 
a tender process was completed, the 
external search consultants, blackwood 
group, were appointed to carry out the 
search for the role of the chairman.the report includes an overview of the 
remuneration policy (set out on pages 
57 to 61) that was introduced with effect 
from 26 january 2017. it also includes the 
amount paid to our executive and non-
executive directors for the year ended 
30 september 2017 and details of how 
the policy will be implemented during the 
financial year ended 30 september 2018.
a complete copy of the remuneration 
policy can be found in the 2016 annual 
report and is available on our website.the value of benefits may 
vary from year to year 
depending on the cost to 
the company from third 
party providers.remuneration policy report

notes to policy table
in addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and 
implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report will be honoured.as detailed in last year’s directors’ remuneration 
report the weightings were adjusted for the year under review (from 70% financial and 30% personal) to place a higher weighting on key 
financial objectives.70% of the award is subject to a challenging range of earnings 
per share targets to be achieved in the financial year ending 30 september 2019.chairman and non-executive director fees
during the year the committee reviewed the chairman’s fee in light of the time commitment required of the role and the fees payable at 
comparator companies and decided on an increase of 3%.annual report

performance graph
the chart below compares the value of £100 invested in ite group plc shares, including reinvested dividends, on 30 september 2008 
compared to the equivalent investment in the ftse 250 index and ftse small cap index, over the last nine financial years.the other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with isas (uk).depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following 
bases:
leasehold land and buildings  – term of lease
plant and equipment  – 4 to 10 years
assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control over those policies.the carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.foreign currencies
transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where 
applicable.notes to the consolidated accounts continued
