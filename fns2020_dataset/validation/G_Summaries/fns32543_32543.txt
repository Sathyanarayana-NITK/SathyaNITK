our performance:
t orque transmission
renold torque transmission is an international 
manufacturer of high integrity torque transmitting 
products used where public safety or assured 
plant operation is critical.the one-off cost of 
the transfer was £2.9m (see note 2(c)) and 
benefits are expected to be realised during 
the next financial year.since the mine needs to remain 
operational at all times, the reliability, high 
efficiency, and quality of the renold solution 
were key factors in the award of the contract.a number of major projects totalling 
approximately £7.8m are already committed 
as at the date of this report including £6.0m 
for the relocation of our chinese chain 
manufacturing facility and £1.2m in respect 
of the roll out of our global it system.æ the fall in exposure over the years has largely been driven by the significant 
falls in membership numbers resulting from the scheme merger and 
various small pots exercises as well as mortality itself and the age of the 
membership.drivers of pension deficit movement

 æ the bar chart shows the evolution of the total membership of the uk 
scheme over the last six years and the numbers in each category.an unsuccessful implementation of the global erp system has the 
potential to materially impact that site’s and possibly the group’s 
performance.in particular, a more 
rigorous use of skills assessments in areas 
such as numerical and verbal reasoning, 
and the insistence on standards of high 
performance in these areas is beginning 
to bear fruit.the board continues to give priority to consideration of corporate 
governance matters, good and effective corporate governance 
being critical to long-term business success.he joined renold from keepmoat group, where he had been 
deputy chief financial officer since june 2015. previously, ian spent ten 
years at speedy hire plc, latterly as group financial controller, from 2010 to 
2015.

appointment to the board: january 2010
experience 
ian, aged 66, was appointed to the board in january 2010 and to the chair 
of the remuneration committee in november 2010. his appointment to 
both was extended in january 2016. ian was appointed as non-executive 
director of autins plc, a company admitted to trading on the aim market 
of the london stock exchange, in march 2016. he has also been a non-
executive director and chairman of hydro international plc and a non-
executive director of ultra electronics holdings plc.during the period, the board has 
received an update from the company secretary in relation to 
the 2016 code.throughout the 
year the executive directors have continued to visit renold sites 
around the world including: the usa, india, france, south africa, 
germany and australia.the senior 
independent director also met with the other directors as part of 
the chairman’s performance evaluation process.the 
committee was satisfied that the extended duration of the pension 
liabilities in germany and the uk, and their priority in recognition, 
justified the extended recovery periods for the associated deferred 
tax assets which were also fully supported by expectations of 
future taxable profitability.the discussion, as it relates to senior 
management, concluded that good progress had been made on 
succession planning as a result of the continued strengthening of 
the management team led by the chief executive but that further 
progress was required.as a 
result, no annual bonus payments were earned by the executive 
directors for the year ended 31 march 2017. 
the committee determined this outcome having formally 
assessed performance against ebitda and net debt targets set 
at the beginning of the year as follows.growth

 the 'actual' amounts disclosed are calculated using constant budgeted exchange rates in accordance with the rule of the scheme.he did not receive a bonus payment for the financial year 
ending 31 march 2017. brian held a number of outstanding ltip awards, and he was treated as a good leaver.the executive directors are 
not members of the company 
pension scheme and have their 
own pension arrangements.2 
further details of awards to the executive directors under the 2004 option plans and psp are on pages 90 and 91. the ltip uses the closing share price on the day of 
vesting less the option exercise price to calculate the value of the award.3 
(b) of the 1,065,089 options awarded to robert purcell on 25 july 2013 under the psp, 100% (the maximum award) vested on 25 july 2016, the performance 
conditions measured to 31 march 2016 having been achieved in full.for the year ended 31 march 2017, the adjusted ebitda for the year was £20.3m and the average net debt was £30.4m (measured at 
budget exchange rates in accordance with the annual bonus rules).in exercising its discretion, the committee agreed that 
the second subsisting psp award of 283,887 nil-cost options made on 4 june 2014 would be pro-rated from the date of the grant to the 
date of cessation (232,601 nil cost options); vesting will remain subject to the original performance conditions measured over the original 
performance period.4 
note 2 to the company financial statements sets out the calculation of revenue (total operating costs) and adjusted operating profit.in preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
 æ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 æ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 æ state whether applicable uk accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 æ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.we agreed the estimated overheads to actual overheads incurred in the year to assess whether 
they were materially different;
 æ assessed the net realisable value (nrv) on a sample basis of stock items by agreeing their subsequent sales 
price to customer invoices to ensure that the items were being held at the lower of cost and nrv;
 æ gained an understanding of the movements in the inventory provision year on year and an assessment of the 
scale of the provision in comparison to the gross stock value, to determine whether there are any unusual 
transactions;
 æ recalculated the value of the provision based on a sample of items; and
 æ where manual adjustments have been made to the provision, we have understood these by gaining supporting 
documentation.during the current year audit, a senior member of the 
group audit team visited two locations in the us and germany.in addition, the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable 
to groups reporting under ifrs.the adjusted eps numbers have been provided in order to give a useful indication of underlying performance by the exclusion of 
exceptional items.furthermore, the contingent consideration paid in the year was lower than the provisional amount anticipated at the acquisition date 
(£0.1m).the rps was formed in june 2013 by the merger of three predecessor plans, all 
of which were already closed to future accrual and to new members.on loss 
of control of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income is 
transferred to the income statement.
