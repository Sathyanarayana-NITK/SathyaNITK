for the wells team, 2017 was 
a fantastic year and that’s down to 
the people and the way in which the 
company encourages us to work.in this regard, the board 
has developed certain strategic tenets to 
guide the company during the current 
phase of its evolution which link with its 
strategy and appetite for risk.the kraken development was sanctioned 
by decc and enquest’s partners in 
november 2013. first oil production  
was achieved on 23 june 2017. prior to 
sanction, enquest identified and 
optimised the development plan using 
enquest’s pre-investment assurance 
processes.potential impact – medium  
(2016 n/a)
likelihood – low (2016 n/a)
related kpis – a, b
the group endeavours to provide a 
secure it environment that is able to resist 
and withstand any attacks or unintentional 
disruption that may compromise sensitive 
data, impact operations or destabilise its 
financial systems; it has a very low 
appetite for this risk.skills and experience

fulbright & jaworski llp 
heading its energy and natural

asia-pacific region.board agendas are 
drawn up by the company secretary in conjunction with the 
chairman and with agreement from the chief executive.the induction programme 
consists of a comprehensive briefing pack, which includes group 
structure details, the constitution of the company, the group 
governance map, a guide to directors’ duties, terms of reference 
of each committee, group policies and the company’s authorities 
matrix.the committee received a report from the group’s head of tax, 
outlining all uncertain tax positions, and evaluated the technical 
arguments supporting the position taken by management.remuneration policy
this section sets out the principles behind our remuneration policy and the policy’s key elements for both the executive and  
non-executive directors that were approved by shareholders at our agm on 25 may 2017, along with the two policy changes  
as set out in the resolution being put to a shareholder vote at the 2018 agm.the committee and i wish to thank all our shareholders for their 
ongoing support over the years.typically, the conditions 
and pay of all employees 
within the company are 
factors considered by the 
committee in its review.if it is considered appropriate to appoint a new director on a below market salary initially 
(for example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) their salary may be increased to a median market level over a period by way of 
increases above the general rate of wage growth in the group and inflation.if tax liabilities arise from an error or omission by the company that is outside of the control of the executive directors, the committee 
will have the ability to reimburse any such tax liabilities.during the annual remuneration review the committee receives a report which details the remuneration arrangements of other 
executive and senior management as well as the overall spend versus budget for all employees.structured board succession planning
one of the key priorities for the nomination committee in 2017 
was to continue to manage the succession of the non-executive 
directors in order to ensure that effective planning was being 
undertaken and, where necessary, acted upon with regard to the 
phasing of non-executive director retirements.this focused on: leadership within 
the organisation; the range of technical knowledge and skills; 
development and execution of strategy; and staff development.as disclosed elsewhere, philip nolan, who served on the 
board since 2012, and neil mcculloch, who joined the board 
after the 2017 agm, stepped down as directors in 2017.

credit facility
in october 2013, the group entered into a six-year $1.7 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility (the ‘rcf’), comprising of a 
committed amount of $1.2 billion (subject to the level of reserves) with a further $500 million available through an accordion structure.mark to market losses on the time value element of the put options in 2016 totalling $5.4 million was recognised in 
finance costs.the balance of the mark to market losses were recognised as an 
exceptional credit/charge in line with the group’s accounting policy.for assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.the assumptions made in arriving at the 
projected cash payments are consistent with the assumptions used in the group’s 2017 year end impairment test, and the resulting cash 
flows were included in the determination of the recoverable value of the project.the parties are currently in discussions pursuant to the dispute 
resolution process under the contract.the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the transaction assets as at the date of acquisition were:
