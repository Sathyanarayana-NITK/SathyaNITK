42 a. leadership 
a1 the role of the board 
the board met formally six times  
during the year.we give due regard 
to the benefits of diversity in its widest 
sense for the current and future board 
composition, recognising that this is 
essential for effective engagement with 
our key stakeholders.during 2016 the board has directly, or 
through delegated authority to the risk 
and audit committees, overseen and 
reviewed the development and 
performance of risk management 
activities and practices and internal 
control systems in the group.three scenarios were then modelled 
for the assessment period: the three 
largest sensitivities in terms of financial 
impact as if each were certain to occur 
independently; the expected financial 
impact for all sensitivities combined 
drawing on the assigned probability  
for each one; and a reverse stress test 
considering what pru, or combination  
of prus might lead to breach of 
performance and cash flow 
solvency thresholds.external audit
• considered the external auditors’  
(ey) engagement terms (including the 
fee proposal) for 2016/17, and made 
recommendations to the board.the chair of 
the audit committee for this business 
confirmed that no major issues were 
identified during that committee’s 
reviews of the first and second 
lines of defence or conflicts  
of interest process.auditor independence and  
non-audit services
the independence of ey is reviewed  
by the committee and confirmed by  
the auditor throughout the year.we considered risks outside of 
agreed risk appetite and concluded that 
where this is the case, the probability of 
occurrence was very low and existing 
mitigating actions were appropriate to 
the scenarios.the payouts reflect 
the strong performance of the group 
over the year and reflect 100.1% 
achievement against the group pbt 
target (measured as profit before tax 
excluding derivatives and the odgen 
impact) and 137.3% achievement 
against the group cash flow target.full details of the payouts are provided 
on page 83.
effectiveness of the remuneration 
committee
an external evaluation of the 
committee’s effectiveness took place 
during the year, as part of the board 
effectiveness review (for details see 
page 51).annual report and accounts 2017 saga plc
76 our remuneration policy and its link to our group strategy for the 2017/18 financial year
the table below summarises the purpose of our remuneration policy and its linkage to our corporate strategic objectives.the table presents the indicative vesting of the 2014 ltip award for lance batchelor and andrew goodsell, who was awarded 
the ltip as executive chairman in 2014 (prior to his change in role of non-executive chairman).as a good 
leaver in reference to his change in role from executive to non-executive chairman, his award was pro-rated to the amount of the 
vesting period completed on the date of cessation as executive chairman (one-third of the original award) but remained subject to 
the achievement of the performance conditions for the award.the remuneration committee believes that the remuneration payable in its earlier years as 
a private company to the executive chairman does not bear comparative value to that which has been and will be paid to the 
group chief executive officer, and has therefore chosen only to disclose remuneration for the group chief executive officer:

notes:
1 the group chief executive officer joined the company on 24 march 2014 the remuneration shown is therefore not for the full financial year.as a result of the share placing 
undertaken by abcl on 21 april 2016, 
abcl held no shares in the company, 
charterhouse ceased to have an interest 
in the company and the private equity 
investment director nominated by them 
resigned from the board with effect from 
22 april 2016.
change of control – significant 
agreements
a number of agreements take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the company including 
following a takeover bid, for example 
insurance, commercial contracts and 
distribution agreements.the rules of the company’s employee 
share plans generally provide for the 
accelerated vesting and/or release of 
share awards in the event of a change  
of control of the company.the process for producing the 
company’s annual report and accounts 
starts with clear direction for all those 
involved, so that the final document 
represents a balanced picture of our 
activities throughout the year and so that 
shareholders are given the information 
they need to assess the performance, 
business model and strategy.the directors are also responsible  
for preparing the strategic report,  
the directors’ report, the directors’ 
remuneration report and the corporate 
governance statement in accordance 
with the companies act 2006 and 
applicable regulations, including the 
requirements of the listing rules and  
the disclosure and transparency rules.for policies 
underwritten by the group underwriter 
and placed via the group intermediary, 
consolidation adjustments are processed 
to ensure that the overall revenue 
recorded in respect of risks underwritten 
by the group is recognised in accordance 
with the group policy.changes from the prior year
the changes in the number of full scope and specific scope entities primarily reflect revisions to the internal reporting and 
consolidation structure within saga.the consolidated financial statements of saga plc and the entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries, collectively 
‘saga group’ or the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 january 2017 were approved for issue by the board of directors on  
28 march 2017. 
saga group offers a wide range of products and services to its customer base which include general insurance products,  
package and cruise holidays, personal finance products, domiciliary care services, and a monthly subscription magazine.unrealised gains and losses, arising on financial assets 
measured at fair value through profit and loss which have not been derecognised as a result of disposal or transfer, represent the 
difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or the purchase value for 
investments acquired during the year, net of the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of 
disposals made during the year.gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.available for sale financial investments  
when a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised directly in equity and there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.the group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at 
initial recognition.g. amendments to ifrs 2 ‘classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions’ 
the amendments to ifrs 2 clarify the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on cash-settled share-based 
payments, the classification of share-based payment transactions with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations and the 
accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the transaction from cash-settled  
to equity-settled.the long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the group are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of 
the scheme over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term 
costs of the scheme.strategic report governance financial statements
