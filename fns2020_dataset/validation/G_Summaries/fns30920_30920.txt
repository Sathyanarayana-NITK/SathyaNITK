in 201 5, we initiated a restructuring programme throughout the 
group to adapt our business and our cost base to the changing 
trading environment.whilst the review has considered all the 
principal risks identiﬁ ed by the group, 
the following were selected for enhanced 
stress testing: an unplanned drop in 
customer demand, debt recovery risk 
due to customer default, raw material 
price inﬂ ation, reduction in earnings 
from increased interest charges and the 
impact of volatility in foreign currency 
earnings.the quality, reliability and consistency 
of the products and process control 
equipment are therefore critical 
to the quality of the ﬁ nished metal 
being produced and the productivity, 
proﬁ tability and safety of our customers’ 
processes.the foundry division’s products, 
solutions and use of advanced 
computer simulation techniques 
allow foundries to reduce defects 
and hence reduce labour intensive 
fettling and machining, minimise 
metal usage requirements, 
inﬂ uence the metal solidiﬁ cation 
process and automate moulding 
and casting, thus reducing cost, 
energy usage and mould size.policies and  procedures  
we continue to enhance the policies that 
underpin the principles set out in the code 
of conduct.our responsibility

anti-bribery and corruption and 
working with third parties
vesuvius engages with various third-
party representatives and intermediaries 
which can present an increased anti-
bribery and corruption risk.our employees’ 
interaction with sales agents is supported 
by an ongoing training programme for 
those who have speciﬁ c responsibility 
for these relationships.in 2017 , vesuvius recorded nine minor 
environmental incidents.in 201 3, i moved back to 
canada to take over the general 
manager role once again and, 
in november 2015, became the 
operations director for advanced 
refractories naft a, responsible 
for managing our production sites 
in the us, canada and mexico.this report 
describes the company’s corporate governance structure 
and explains how, during the year ended 31 december 2017 , 
vesuvius applied the main principles of the uk corporate 
governance code 2016 issued by the financial reporting 
council (the ‘code’).biographical details of

risk management and internal control – key features 84
vesuvius plc
annual report and accounts 201 7
reviewing the effectiveness of risk management 
and internal control
the internal control system covers the group as a whole, and 
is monitored and supported by the group’s internal audit 
function, which conducts reviews of vesuvius’ businesses and 
reports objectively both on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the system of internal control and on those businesses’ 
compliance with group policies and procedures.the audit committee
the members of the audit committee are set out on page 85. 
the audit committee report which describes the audit 
committee’s work in discharging its responsibilities, is set 
out on pages 85 to 92.
executive compensation and risk
all of the independent non-executive directors serve on 
both the audit and remuneration committees.the majority of 
meetings with investors are led by them.3.  the committee considered the company’s going concern statement and 
challenged the nature, quantum and assessment of the signiﬁ cant risks 
to the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity of the 
group that were modelled as part of the scenarios and stress testing 
undertaken to support the viability statement made by the company in 
the 2016 accounts.it considered 
these areas to be signiﬁ cant taking into account the level 
of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by 
management.this ensures that only signiﬁ cant 
restructuring programmes that have a deﬁ ned scope and are 
material in nature are reported separately, which enables the 
reader more clearly to understand the underlying results of 
the group.the committee 
challenged both the determination of the relevant cgus, the 
planned and terminal growth assumptions as well as the 
discount rates used in the assessments and the relevant 
sensitivities that were evaluated.during 2017 the group continued its review of third-party 
representatives and intermediaries.the nomination committee believes 
that diversity underpins the successful operation of the board.a summary of these arrangements was 
included in the section 430(2b) statement published on the 
company’s website, and details are also included in this year’s 
remuneration report.whilst the committee retains overall discretion on determining 
‘good leaver’ status, it typically deﬁ nes a ‘good leaver’ in 
circumstances such as retirement with agreement of the 
company, ill health, disability, death, redundancy, or part of 
the business in which the individual is employed or engaged 
ceasing to be part of the group.note:
1.  in certain circumstances, the committee may determine that unvested awards under the v esuvius share plan will not vest on a change of control but will instead be replaced 
by an equivalent grant of a new award, as determined by the committee, in the new company .at the annual general meeting on 10 may 2017 , the directors 
were authorised to issue relevant securities up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £9,040,463, and, in connection with a rights 
issue, to issue relevant securities up to a further nominal value 
of £9,040,463.our tests included, but were not limited 
to, review of the ﬁ nancial statement disclosures to underlying 
supporting documentation, review of correspondence with 
legal advisers, enquiries of management, review of signiﬁ cant 
component auditors’ work and review of internal audit reports 
in so far as they related to the ﬁ nancial statements.in addition, the impact of us tax changes 
enacted in december 2017 requires 
reassessment of the calculation of total 
tax losses and the lives attached to these.1
