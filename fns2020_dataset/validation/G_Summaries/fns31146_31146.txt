organisational and capability performance.the biographical details  
of each of the directors, along with each of their individual dates of appointment, are set out on pages 50 and 51.
both on an individual and collective basis, the directors have the range of skills, understanding, experience and expertise necessary to ensure the 
effective leadership of the group and to ensure corporate governance standards are maintained.the board continues to ensure that each of the 
non-executive directors, where possible, remain impartial and independent, notwithstanding the appointment in february 2017 of mr sampson  
as explained above.communication with shareholders

tsr peer group
in electing to include a tsr component under the psp , the committee was conscious of the requirement to determine appropriate peers to 
compare our tsr performance against.performance and remuneration outcomes for fy17 
while much progress was achieved in fy17 with the completion of an intense operational and network expansion in the uk, and the transformational 
acquisition of peacock foods in the us, our financial performance in the year has been challenging and we have not met our financial targets.the annual bonus was based on delivery of financial performance targets (75%) and strategic and personal objectives (25%).we believe that individuals should be rewarded based on their contribution to the group and the success of the group and that reward should  
be competitive in the market, without paying more than is necessary to recruit and retain individuals.the committee considered these factors along with the underlying performance of the 
business, and determined that the formulaic level of vesting was appropriate.as in previous years, bonus will be based on group financial targets (75% of maximum bonus) and on personal and strategic goals (25% of 
maximum).the board reviewed its non-executive director fees in fy17, the previous review being in january 2014, in the context of practice at companies of 
a similar size and complexity.the report includes 
an overview of these matters as well as the other principal matters which the committee has assessed during the year, with the aim of providing  
an understanding of its essential role in protecting the interests of our shareholders through ensuring the integrity of the company’s published 
financial information and the effectiveness of the risk management process.consequently,  
the committee secured a one-year extension to the mandatory rotation of kpmg’s tenure from the irish auditing and 
accounting supervisory authority.the 
biographical details of each member are set out on pages 50 and 51. the group company secretary acts as secretary to the committee.in fy18, the committee will assist the group chairman in the external evaluation of the board, where appropriate.the group controls an entity when it is 
exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity.revenue recognition
revenue represents the fair value of the sale of goods and rendering of services to external customers, net of trade discounts and value added tax 
in the ordinary course of the group’s activities.the interest element of the finance cost is charged to the profit or loss 
over the lease period.tax is recognised in the profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in the group statement of recognised income and expense or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in the group 
statement of recognised income and expense or directly in equity, respectively.124 greencore group plc | annual report and financial statements 2017

employee share-based payments
the group grants equity settled share-based payments to employees (through the performance share plan, the annual bonus plan, the employee 
sharesave scheme and the executive option scheme).in accordance with this scheme, participants are 
awarded an allotment of shares which will vest over three years subject to vesting conditions for growth in return on invested capital and in 
earnings per share.the number of shares granted is calculated based on the market value on the date of allocation.the carrying value of goodwill assigned to each cgu is not negatively impacted by a decline  
in projected cashflows of 18%, a reduction in the inflationary linked long-term growth rate to zero or an increase in the discount rate of 44%.remediation and closure obligations amounting to £6.1m provided in the year relates to the exit from the evercreech facility.all of the legacy defined benefit pension schemes are closed to future accrual and there is an assumption applied in the valuation of the schemes 
that there will be no discretionary increases in pensions in payment.in particular the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities under ias 19 employee 
benefits is determined by reference to the yield on high grade corporate bonds of comparable duration to the liabilities.notes to the company financial statements
