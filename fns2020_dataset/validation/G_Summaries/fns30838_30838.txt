definition
as we grow our international content business, tracking the performance of the creative 
renewal pipeline and the number of new commissions won is a key indicator.we also use 
our wacc to assess the performance of our investments and in the 
year we had a 13% return on capital employed from our acquisitions, 
well in excess of our wacc.in the year, we saw an increase in working capital.at 31 december 2017, £570 million of the £630 million rcf 
was undrawn.the year-on-year reduction in the deﬁcit reflects gains 
from asset values in the year, more accurate data on scheme 
members based on the preliminary results of 1 january 2017 
actuarial valuation and our deﬁcit funding contributions of £80 
million.our ongoing process for risk identiﬁcation, review and 
management is set out below and is consistent with last year.previous experience: executive

management board
meets to consider, approve and implement strategy and operational plans, monitors operating 
and ﬁnancial performance, and assesses and manages risk.the committee also addresses speciﬁc queries referred to it by the board or remuneration committee.financial reporting and 
judgement involved:
• the accounting for the 
ongoing operations of gurney
• the measurement of liabilities 
held for settlement of a 
counter-claim, if any, and 
for the cost of ongoing 
legal proceedings
based on the current status of 
the business, and taking into 
account the legal proceedings, 
management proposed that 
for accounting purposes:
• gurney should be treated as 
if it had been wound down with 
no further results recognised 
in the accounts, a provision 
recognised against the 
goodwill and against assets 
within gurney 
• an acquisition-related 
liability should continue to 
be maintained for potential 
ongoing contractual 
obligations
• no provision should be held 
for the counter-claim against 
itv as the directors believe 
this counter-claim is completely 
without merit, and
• a provision for legal costs, 
accounted as an exceptional 
cost, should be held for ongoing 
legal proceedings
the committee’s actions included:
• a review of the nature of 
the dispute and developments 
to date
• discussions with itv’s general 
counsel and us legal advisers, 
and
• a review of management’s 
proposed accounting treatment, 
including provisions held
the committee agreed with 
management’s proposed 
accounting and presentation.audit and risk committee report continued 77

other matters
in addition to ﬁnancial reporting matters, the following topics were reviewed:
area of focus issue action taken by committee outcome
cyber security 
and simulation 
exercise
cyber security is an increasing 
risk as our business develops 
new revenue streams and direct 
to consumer propositions.the committee also reviewed the general data protection regulation readiness plan for the business.fees paid to kpmg for 2017 are 
set out in note 2.1 on page 128. 
we monitor relationships with 
other audit ﬁrms to ensure we 
have sufﬁcient choice for any 
future appointment.in addition, the committee has reviewed the malus and 
clawback provisions in the rules of the bonus and share award plans to ensure they 
remain appropriate.the committee may amend the bonus pay-out should any formulaic assessment of performance not reflect the overall business 
performance of the year.the committee considers pay in the wider group from a number of perspectives.in addition, a bonus arrangement extends to all our employees, providing a comprehensive incentive framework that rewards everybody 
when the company is successful.therefore, a quantification of the impact on  
the group’s results cannot currently be estimated.accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenue is stated exclusive of vat and equivalent sales taxes, and comprises the sale of products and services  
to third parties.revenue is recognised when the group has transferred both the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control, 
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.this cost was primarily comprised of redundancies across the 
broadcasting, itv studios and shared services divisions as well as professional support to successfully plan and 
implement the project.the group therefore defines working capital as distribution  
rights, programme rights and production costs, trade and other receivables and  
trade and other payables.the broadcast programme rights and other inventory at the year end are shown in the table below:

broadcast programme and transmission commitments 
transmission commitments are the contracted future payments under transmission supply agreements that require 
the use of transponder assets for a period of up to ten years with payments increasing over time, limited by specific  
rpi caps.distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and charged through operating costs in the income statement  
over a period not exceeding five years, reflecting the valu e and pattern in which the right is consumed.if different estimates  
of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were 
made, these changes could materially alter the projected valu e of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence 
materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.the group 
makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not 
consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit 
pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial position.the main assumptions are: 
• an estimate of increases in pension payments;  
• the life expectancy of members; 
• the effect of inflation on all these factors;  
• the discount rate used to estimate the present day fair value of these obligations; 
• future salary levels for the utv scheme; and 
• future pensionable salary levels for the utv scheme.4.6.5 retained earnings 
the retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year attributable to owners of the company of £409 million  
(2016: £448 million) and other items recognised directly through equity as presented in the consolidated statement  
of changes in equity.
