the performance of new shops  
opened in 2017 was encouraging,  
with sales above the level expected  
at the time of investment.we held higher cash balances at the end of 2017  
as a result of delays in the phasing of capital 
expenditure, as noted above.risk committee/operating board
 – quarterly detailed discussion of significant risks;
 – understanding the business’ exposure to risk;
 – supporting the implementation of the 
company’s risk management strategy; and
 – escalating significant matters to main board,  
via the audit committee.in order to stress-test the company’s financial 
resilience three separate scenarios were created to 
simulate the impact arising from the occurrence of 
the following principal risks:
1. a brand-damaging food scare resulting in a 
significant one-year sales reduction followed  
by gradual recovery of confidence.new
impact  
of brexit
in addition to the risks relating to the economy and resources highlighted above, there is uncertainty 
regarding the possibility of changes to trading arrangements, customs agreement, tariffs etc.this governance 
report, together with information contained elsewhere within the directors’ report, describes how the 
relevant principles and provisions of the governance code were applied in 2017 and will be relevant to  
the company for the 2018 financial year.the board
effectiveness
the chairman chairs the nominations committee whose primary function is to consider the blend of skills and 
experience that the directors bring to the board.diversity
the board believes it is in the best interests of the company to bring more women through to the top levels of the organisation and,  
as a result of this belief, a programme launched in 2012 to encourage women to strive for the most senior positions in the business.the company secretary acts as secretary to and is generally in attendance at each of these committees, 
and each of the committees is provided with sufficient resources to undertake its duties.44

relations with shareholders
the board ensures that there is effective communication with individual and institutional shareholders through the announcement  
of regular trading updates, as well as general presentations after announcement of the interim and preliminary results and the posting 
of results on the company’s website.the senior independent director is available to shareholders if they have concerns which they have not been able to resolve  
through the normal channels of the chairman, chief executive or finance director, or for circumstances where such contact would  
not be appropriate.there are no shares in the company that grant the holder special rights with regard  
to the control of the company;
– at general meetings of the company, on a show of hands every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote only 
and, in the case of a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share in the capital of the 
company held by him or her;
– the company’s articles of association set out the circumstances in which shares may become disenfranchised.we meet formally at key times within our 
reporting calendar and the agendas for our meetings 
are designed to cover all significant areas of risk over 
the course of the year and to provide oversight and 
challenge to the key financial judgements, controls 
and processes that operate within the company.cyber security 
matters continue to be a priority for the committee, 
as do the company’s preparations for the 
implementation of ifrs 16 leasing at the start  
of 2019. 
overall i am satisfied that the activities of the 
committee enable it to gain a good understanding 
of the key matters impacting the company during 
the year, along with oversight of the governance and 
operation of its key controls and ultimately to draw 
the conclusions set out in the report below.the 
committee gave careful consideration to the judgements made in the separate 
disclosure of non-underlying items, both in respect of events occurring in 2017 and 
also changes in circumstance in respect of provisions relating to events from prior 
years, ensuring that the annual report as a whole presents a balanced view, including 
the presentation of gaap and non-gaap measures.the committee assessed the underlying assumptions and concluded that 
they were appropriate and also discussed the appropriateness of the assumptions 
with the external auditor.the case of low level theft related to our franchise operation, and this was  
referred to the relevant franchise partner for action.non-executive directors are paid a basic fee and the chairs  
of the main board committees and the senior independent 
director (sid) are paid an additional fee to reflect their 
additional responsibilities.the committee may make 
one-off additional cash and/or share-based awards as it deems appropriate, and if the circumstances so demand to take account  
of deferred pay forfeited by an executive director on leaving a previous employer.for the appointment of a new chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the 
approved remuneration policy at that time.the auditor’s 
opinion is set out on pages 71 to 75 and we have indicated appropriately the audited sections of this remuneration report.shareholders were asked to approve the 2016 directors’ remuneration report, our new remuneration policy and an amendment to the 
psp and did so as outlined below.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its accounts comply with the companies act 2006. they are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.the directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website.overview

2. key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the accounts and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.the next phase of the 
supply chain investment programme, including  
the creation of centres of excellence, was  
announced in early 2017. the consolidation of 
certain production processes may reduce the  
useful economic life and recoverable amount of 
certain assets.73

meet its short-term liabilities.the model has been tested in various scenarios for the group’s viability statement which 
is included in the strategic report on page 81. the group had significant cash resources at the year end.
