accordingly, 
we established our six principles and three 
steps to long-term success – being stability, 
strategy and growth – which were rolled 
out across the business, supported by  
an extensive programme of video 
communication in all languages and 
townhall presentations.in order to support our stability and future 
growth agenda, we identified the need for 
an incremental £30m of investment over 
three years in key areas; of this, c. £10m is 
it-related and approximately £20m is to 
drive an equipment upgrade programme 
in packaging.filters
while essentra’s addressed segments  
are fundamentally stable in an overall 
declining tobacco market – given our 
significant weighting towards special filters 
and asia – there is scope to refine and 
distinguish the current proposition further, 
with the objective of both expanding the 
share of wallet with multi-nationals while 
simultaneously driving share among 
independent customers.although we are still some way from the 
levels of excellence to which the board  
and gmc are committed – and which are 
espoused in our updated group hse policy 
– we made progress in improving the hse 
culture across the group in 2017 .accordingly, there is  
a significant role for our group human 
resources team, from monitoring and 
reviewing the action plans from 
engagement surveys and further 
enhancing and managing our learning & 
development programmes, to continuing 
to lead the recruitment process for talent  
to fill skill gaps and benefiting from the 
addition of dedicated resource to expand 
our employee communications.separately, we received ps9000 
certification across all our health & 
personal care packaging sites in the us  
and puerto rico, making essentra the  
first manufacturer of secondary packaging 
in the region to secure this accreditation, 
and underscoring our commitment to 
good manufacturing practice and  
“best in class” quality assurance to our 
pharmaceutical customers.in addition, we also 
successfully placed us$75m of loan  
notes spread over seven, 10 and 12-year 
maturities in the united states private 
placement market (“uspp notes”).annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com

strategic report | financial review “in 2017 , we 
strengthened  
the balance sheet, 
generated a very 
good level of cash 
conversion and 
refinanced our entire 
debt facilities, helping 
to secure not only 
our current financial 
stability but also 
underpinning  
our medium to  
long-term position.”
this refinancing optimises essentra’s 
financial position going forward, in terms 
of interest cost, sources of funding and 
maturities – as well as providing further 
headroom – thus underpinning the 
medium and long-term financial stability 
of the company as we pursue our 
strategic objectives.reinforcing our commitment to these 
end-markets, in october we created  
a global divisional organisation with 
leadership under a single functional  
team, which will allow us to serve our 
multi-national customers better and with 
greater alignment, and to leverage our 
scale in innovation, best practice transfer 
and talent development.the principal risk section  
of the 2016 annual report included 
commentary on the failure of the 
company to manage risks relating  
to the packaging division during 2016, 
which led to a decline in overall financial 
performance.the audit committee will 
engage directly with individual enabling 
functions and divisional businesses, 
including deep dive reviews, as part of 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities on  
the risk management processes.coming out of this review, a range of potential 
mitigation options were identified, which the 
company is now in the process of reviewing.following the risk reviews during 2017 , the 
company has reaffirmed its commitment 
to treat safety as an absolute priority and 
this is reflected through its elevation to one 
of the principal risks to the company.supply chain single point of failure has 
been identified as a new principal risk to 
the company, and the risk incorporates 
raw material supply which was previously 
identified as a principal risk.for example, 
this includes requiring employees to inform 
their line managers of any change in 
circumstances – such as any conflict  
of interest or outside business interest  
– a significant deterioration in the health 
and safety of their working environment  
or their ability to protect essentra’s assets.as a board we 
have established a clear commitment  
to ensuring the company operates 
more effectively and efficiently as a 
result of better planning, improved 
process, more focused reviews and 
higher quality reporting, to deliver 
material performance improvements 
and the cultural change necessary  
for sustainable future growth.lintstock presented their report during  
a meeting of the board, addressing the 
following areas:
 > the current composition of the board, 
and any particular considerations 
relevant to any potential new director 
appointments
 > the management of board and 
committee meetings, including the 
quality of the board and committee 
meeting packs
 > the board’s relationships with, and 
exposure to, management both inside 
and outside the boardroom
 > the board’s understanding of the 
component parts of the business, as 
well as the board’s oversight of strategy, 
major projects and the main risks facing 
the business
 > the delegation of authority from  
the board to senior management, 
alongside the board’s oversight of  
the performance of management
 > the identification of the priorities for  
the new chief executive, as well as  
the priorities for improving the board’s 
performance over the coming year
 > the performance of each of the board 
committees in fulfilling their mandates
further to the completion of the 
questionnaires, an action plan was  
drawn up which was and continues  
to be regularly reviewed for progress at 
scheduled board meetings.this included  
the provision of meeting papers, annual 
schedule of agenda items and the future 
calendar of meetings, and should enable 
the board to improve its ability to operate 
more effectively.the audit committee is committed to a 
prioritised and structured programme to 
drive improvements in the effectiveness  
of the internal audit function through 
better engagement with the businesses 
and further reduce the risk of error, fraud 
or poor practice.control of significant risks
the board’s responsibility for risk and risk 
management in essentra encompasses:
 > determining the company’s approach 
to risk
 > setting and instilling the appropriate 
culture throughout the company
 > identifying the risks inherent in the 
company’s business model and 
strategy, including risks from  
external factors
 > monitoring the company’s exposure  
to risk and the key risks that could 
undermine its strategy, reputation  
or long-term viability
 > providing an effective oversight of  
the risk management processes in  
the company
 > ensuring the company has effective 
crisis management systems
there is a group risk framework in place  
to support the board in fulfilling these 
responsibilities and to ensure that risk review 
processes are embedded within the business.annual report 2017 | www.essentraplc.com
