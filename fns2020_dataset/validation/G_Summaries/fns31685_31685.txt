external economic factors as with most other businesses 
in the uk, our operations can be 
adversely affected by a significant 
downturn in the economy.the group does not have any other significant environmental, employee, social, community or human rights issues.directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
the directors who were members of the board on the date the directors’ report was approved have confirmed the following:
• to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief there is no information relevant to their report of which the auditor is unaware; and
• each director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be expected to take to be aware of relevant audit information 
and to establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.the non-executive directors are encouraged to constructively challenge the 
executive directors and help develop proposals on strategy.in addition to his role as non-executive chairman of the company, sir michael heller is executive chairman of london & associated 
properties plc and bisichi mining plc, both of which are listed on the london stock exchange.the committee is responsible for proposing 
candidates for appointment to the board, having regard to the balance of skills, experience and knowledge of the company on the board, 
how the board works together as a unit and other factors relevant to its effectiveness.appointments to the board are recommended by the nomination committee on 
the basis of the experience and abilities of the candidate, regardless of gender or race.compliance
the group complied with the provisions of the code throughout the period under review other than as detailed below:
a)  the group’s non-executive directors have not been appointed for specified terms.the main responsibilities of the audit committee are:
• to monitor the adequacy of the group’s internal financial controls;
• to take primary responsibility for appointing and re-appointing auditors;
• to review and monitor the scope, results and cost effectiveness of the external audit process;
• to monitor the procedures in place to safeguard the objectivity of the auditor and its independence in relation to non-audit services;
• to review the key assumptions and estimates or judgements that have been applied by management in the published financial 
statements; and
• to consider the need for an internal audit function.the bonus is awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee.• the risk – accounting application: the group’s contracts with its customers involve the delivery of multiple services.although the contracts entered into by the 
group are of limited complexity and variety, there are a large number of transactions to be processed as a result there is a risk that not 
all revenue is recognized in the appropriate period.• the risk – accounting treatment – the capitalisation criteria are inherently judgmental and there is a risk that qualifying projects may 
not be identified.independent auditor’s report continued

other than the company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.the group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.the acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.periodic service charges are recognised 
evenly over the contract term, reflecting the group’s obligation to support the software and maintain the provision of the hosted service 
throughout the contract period.research and development
expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in the income statement as incurred.on initial classification 
as held for sale, non-current assets are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, with any 
adjustments taken to the income statement.the credit is presented in the income statement as a deduction 
from the current tax expense to the extent that the entity is entitled to claim the credit in the current reporting period.the premiums relating to defined contribution schemes 
are charged to the income statement in the period in which they accrue.the main areas of estimation and accounting judgement are:
estimates
employee benefits
the calculation of the deficit or surplus on the group’s defined benefit pension scheme is based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
including discount rate, future rate of inflation and future changes in mortality rates.details of the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the key actuarial assumptions 
are provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.this note presents material information about the group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the group’s objectives, policies and 
procedures for measuring and managing risk, and the group’s management of capital.credit risk
credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations and arises principally from the group’s receivables from customers and investments.the directors are reviewing the 
company’s standard hosting agreements in accordance with this guidance to identify the distinct services promised in a hosting contract
