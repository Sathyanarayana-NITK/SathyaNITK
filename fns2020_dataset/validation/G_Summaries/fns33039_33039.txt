the installation of new network components, focused on improving
the quality of individual workmanship and concentrated on

indicator to measure the effectiveness of our investment.csr opportunities
the increasing importance of sustainability issues both inside and
outside bt is leading to a much greater focus on the
opportunities that csr provides as well as the risks that need to
be managed.the changes required to capture
the separate reporting of these new products and services were
introduced during the 2006 ﬁnancial year and therefore actual
data was available to support the estimates and assumptions
required to restate the results for that year.in addition, there has been
increased 21cn related activity in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.the increase in the 2007 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the revenue
growth of 4% offset by increased operating costs, described
above.in addition, the
group raised new sterling ﬂoating rate borrowing of £1,000
million and issued commercial paper raising net proceeds of
£464 million.in 2001, bt’s net debt
reached £27.9 billion and as part of the group’s transformation
strategy the group went through a major restructuring to reduce
the level of net debt and improve the group’s ﬁnancial strength.capital expenditure is expected to
remain at around £3.2 billion in the 2008 ﬁnancial year as the

directors’ information
election and re-election
all directors are required by the company’s articles of association
to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst annual general meeting
(agm) after their appointment, if appointed by the board.r the group’s internal auditors carry out continuing assessments
of the quality of risk management and control.bt complies with the legal and regulatory requirements
introduced pursuant to this legislation, in so far as they are
applicable to the group.the cumulative impact of
a revision in estimates is recorded in the period in which such
revisions become likely and can be estimated.the group also operates deﬁned contribution pension schemes
and the income statement is charged with the contributions
payable.critical accounting estimates and key
judgements
the preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with ifrss
requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions.furthermore, the fundamental level of reorganisation and restructuring which occurred, combined with the fact that the products
previously sold by bt wholesale no longer exist, mean it is also impracticable to report the results for the current ﬁnancial year on
the old business segment structure.specific items
therefore include a net credit of £1,067 million, which represents those elements of the tax charges previously recognised that were in excess of the final agreed liability of £938 million; interest
income of £139 million on the repayment; and operating costs of £10 million, representing the costs associated with reaching the agreement.the group also acquired dabs.com and
plusnet, for which the relevant cgus are considered to be the enterprises and consumer divisions of bt retail, respectively.bt group plc annual report & form 20-f 103
