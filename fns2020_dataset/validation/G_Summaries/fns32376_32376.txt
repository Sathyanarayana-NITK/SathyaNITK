we expect that the higher margin 
achieved during the second half of the year 
can be maintained and, as we continue to 
focus on operational efficiencies and the 
revenue profile shifts more toward turn-key 
solutions, the margins should continue to 
improve further.strategic progress during the year

the audit and risk committee (‘the 
committee’) report for the year ended 
31 march 2017 is set out on the following 
pages 47 to 50. the committee completed 
its work plan for the year and continuously 
reviewed internal control, risk, accounting 
policies and regulatory guidance.the committee’s terms of reference are 
reviewed annually.the committee’s report comprises three 
sections, namely:
• this statement, which sets out a 
summary of and explains the major 
decisions on directors’ remuneration
• the directors’ remuneration policy,  
for shareholder approval at the 2017 
annual general meeting
• the directors’ annual remuneration 
report, which provides details on 
how the policy will operate in the 
forthcoming year and states the 
remuneration earned by the directors 
in the year to 31 march 2017
although, as an aim listed company, 
scapa is not required to have a directors’ 
remuneration policy (“policy”) the 
company introduced a policy which  
was approved by 99.75% of shareholders 
at the 2014 annual general meeting.non-executive directors are 
expected to build up and hold a material 
level of shareholding within a reasonable 
period of appointment.this is considered 
an effective way to align the interests of 
the directors and shareholders over the 
long term.corporate governance

long‑term incentives
performance share plan (psp) 
the company adopted a psp in 2004, which was replaced in 2011 by a new psp adopted by the company at the annual general 
meeting.when 
determining the trading eps growth, the impact of material acquisitions, disposals and changes in the issued share capital will be 
disregarded to ensure that they do not artificially affect the eps measurement.for the 
purposes of the plan, the share price on each measurement date will be the average closing price of the company’s shares over the 
30-day period commencing on the measurement date.corporate governance

note: these options, granted under an all-employee share scheme, are not subject to performance conditions.change in remuneration of chief executive compared to group employees
the table below sets out the increase in remuneration of the chief executive and that of the leadership team, which comprises 25 
employees (excluding new starters during the year):
percentage change in remuneration in 2016 compared with remuneration in 2017
chief executive leadership team
salary/fees 9.2% 6.9%
benefits 0.3% –
annual bonus 3.8% 13.7%
total remuneration* 3.7% 9.0%
* excludes share-based payments and share price incentives as these do not permit fair comparison with the leadership team
the committee has selected the leadership team as the most relevant comparator group, taking into account the structure of 
remuneration and ability of the leadership team to earn a bonus in addition to receiving a base salary.this includes a fee for chairing the nominations committee.after making 
enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.details of the 
authorities to be sought at the annual 
general meeting on 18 july 2017 are set out 
in the notice of annual general meeting.at the 
inventory counts, along with other 
procedures, we assessed the condition 
of inventory to evaluate the adequacy 
of inventory provisions for obsolete 
and damaged goods.further details can be found in point 2 
of the critical accounting judgements 
on page 87.
we considered the appropriateness 
of the assumptions underpinning the 
valuation of pension scheme liabilities 
provided by the group’s actuary.the 
balance has increased due to the 
acquisition of euromed in the year and the 
impact of foreign exchange.in line with the prior year, the current year profit before tax 
has been adjusted for exceptional items incurred in the year related to site closure costs and 
asset write offs as disclosed in note 4 of the accounts.the increase is to align 
with market practice.foreign currency translation  
(a) functional and presentation currency  
items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.(e) share price incentive plan  
the group accounts for the share price incentive plan in line with ias 19 as the basis of compensation is not an award of shares and 
therefore does not fall under the remit of ifrs 2. 
provisions 
provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.during the year to march 2016 a postcode mortality exercise was conducted on the 
schemes membership.they have all been applied 
consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the company’s 
financial statements.further detail is contained in the directors’ report on page 68 and in the viability statement on page 19. 
tangible fixed assets  
tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment.number of shares
