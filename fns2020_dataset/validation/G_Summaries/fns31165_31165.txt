set a number of internal targets that frame 
its appetite for risk, with boundaries defining 
the limits the group should operate within 
and trigger points to help monitor and 
identify where there is an increased risk of 
reaching the boundaries.the day to day 
risk management is the responsibility of 
the brand managing directors and this 
is regularly reviewed during meetings with 
the executive directors.the external investments made in 2016 have been 
integrated into the group and we continue to work 
with them to identify opportunities to develop their 
businesses.with any investment activity the fit of the
