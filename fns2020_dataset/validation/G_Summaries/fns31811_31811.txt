(a) statement of compliance
the group’ s and parent company’ s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the european union (“ifrs”) and international financial reporting committee (“ifric”) interpretations as they apply to the 
financial statements of the group for the period ended 31 july 2017.however, given the nature 
of the group’ s biotechnology-based business and need for ongoing investment in its drug development activities, the group will be 
looking to raise additional funds in the future to allow for continued development.inputs required for this arise from judgements relating to the future volatility 
of the share price of c4xd and comparable companies, the group’ s expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected lives 
of the options.the carrying value of the 
unrecognised tax losses at 31 july 2017 was £1,425,000 (2016: £830,000).further information is included in note 9.(a) basis of consolidation
the group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of c4x discovery holdings plc and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) 
drawn up to 31 july each year.all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which 
control is transferred to the group.the group’ s revenues to date comprise amounts earned under joint development agreements and individual project development 
programmes in respect of novel small molecule therapies.such intangible assets will be 
amortised on a straight-line basis from the point at which the assets are ready for use over the period of the expected benefit, and will 
be reviewed for impairment at each reporting date based on the circumstances at the reporting date.www.c4xdiscovery.com
