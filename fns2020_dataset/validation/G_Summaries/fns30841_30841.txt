profit before tax indicates the value 
generated by the company in the  
year and as such is an important 
indicator of progress in executing  
the group’s strategy.north american revenues 
increased sequentially throughout  
the year, reflecting input trends while 
international revenues stabilised during 
the second half of the year.ricardo garib

the division invested early to take advantage 
of increased market confidence and leverage 
its technology leadership and extensive 
service network.highly engineered equipment
through its technology leadership,  
the division has built up a significant 
installed base of original equipment.the 
division continued to innovate including 
introducing the simplified frac system, 
which reduces the amount of iron 
required on a frac site, improving 
safety and uptime.there was limited 
project activity with competitive  
market conditions and pricing pressure  
a common feature.44

managing risk effectively
we operate in a complex global 
environment, where opportunities  
come with corresponding risks.5.  capital structure
we are prepared to use leverage in pursuit of our 
growth agenda and will actively seek low cost debt  
to fund the group but, recognising cyclicality in our  
end markets, will maintain significant headroom  
against our financial covenants.this is articulated in a  
series of group policies and delegated 
authority matrices, as well as the 
parameters within the approved risk 
appetite statement.in addition, our ability  
to flex our cost base to reflect our existing 
markets – as evidenced by our recent 
cost reduction programmes – protects  
our viability in the face of adverse 
economic conditions and / or additional 
risks highlighted.following a review  
of our existing policies and practices  
and in light of the introduction of the 
modern slavery act in the uk, we 
published our first annual modern  
slavery statement in march 2017 and 
have subsequently developed a training 
programme for specific employees on 
this issue.in addition, a mandatory e-learning 
training programme has been developed 
and is, in the first instance, aimed at 
employees who are located in identified 
high-risk jurisdictions.65

creating opportunities to improve the 
environmental performance of our 
operations and those of our customers.the board leads by example and works 
diligently to ensure that the weir values, 
corporate strategy and business model 
are embedded within our culture and at all 
levels and aspects of our business.rosemary has held a 
range of positions 
covering all aspects of 
human resources across

being based in new york

business solutions.the terms of reference  
of the disclosure committee are 
available on the company’s website at 
www.corporategovernance.weir set out 
in writing and approved by the board.the committee is responsible to the 
board as a whole and meets as required.following 
the board and committee structure set 
out on page 76, various internal and 
external sources of assurance report 
to the board and management.details of the recruitment process  
are below.given the significant investment in inventory within both the 
minerals and oil & gas divisions, both of which are impacted  
by commodity cycles, this remains a judgement for specific 
consideration.maximum award size significantly reduced by 50% from previous ltip 
award levels (the rationale for this discount is discussed in more detail  
in the next section): 
• ceo 125% of base salary
• cfo 100% of base salary
vesting phased over a five-year period, with vested shares released 
between five and seven years from grant.payment of any strategic component will be  
subject to a discretionary underpin (including 
individual performance).malus and clawback (applicable for three years from vesting) provisions  
may be applied in the event of:
• a discovery of a material misstatement in the audited consolidated  
accounts of the group or audited accounts of any group company;
• action or conduct which can be considered as gross misconduct;
• events or behaviour which have a significant detrimental impact on  
the reputation of any group company and which can be attributed  
to the individual award holder;
• the information used to determine the number of shares over which  
an award is granted or vests is found to be materially incorrect,  
mistaken or misrepresented to the advantage of the award holder.each of the directors has taken all of the 
steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a director to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the company’s auditors  
are aware of that information.we also assessed the 
recognition of an offsetting insurance asset in the financial statements 
and considered it to be appropriate.we have nothing to report.the fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based  
on spot and forward foreign exchange rates and counterparty, and the group’s own, credit risk.2017

annual report and financial statements 2017 8. discontinued operations
during the year ended 31 december 2017 there were no disposals of businesses which met the definition of a discontinued 
operation under ifrs 5.
in 2016, the group disposed of ynfiniti engineering services (31 may 2016), american hydro corporation and the trade  
and assets of the montreal business of weir canada inc. (30 june 2016) for a combined consideration of £38.4m of which  
£3.6m was to be held in escrow for one year.deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of £18.2m (2016: £11.5m) have not been recognised on the grounds that there is 
insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.these plans combined make up 3% of the group’s pension and other post-employment benefit plan commitments and 2% of 
the group’s total associated assets.the fair value of the ltip at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.if you receive any unsolicited
