e.g.in the united states the federal reserve 
took a year-long pause following its first 
move towards interest rate normalisation in 
december 2015. inflation moved sideways 
for the first seven months of the calendar 
year and the us dollar showed a similar 
lack of direction, range-trading up until 
the election date in november.effects on record’s strategies
results for uk- and us-based dynamic 
hedging clients were necessarily driven 
by the impact of shifting political and 
economic expectations on the strength or 
weakness of the pound and the us dollar.record’s dynamic hedging 
product increased hedge ratios in line with 
us dollar strength, though programmes 
experienced negative hedging returns 
due to the costs associated with varying 
the hedge ratios in the first half of the 
year, as the us dollar traded in a relatively 
narrow range.the 
foreign exchange impact of the conversion 
of non-us dollar mandate sizes into us 
dollar aume had the impact of decreasing 
aume by $3.3 billion over the year.to this end, 
the group maintains a financial model 
to assist it in forecasting future capital 
requirements over a three year cycle under 
various scenarios and monitors the capital 
and liquidity positions of the group on an 
ongoing and frequent basis.the principal risks and details of 
how these are managed across the group 
are set out below.client 
relationships
 people
 profitability
the group has dedicated consultant relations staff 
and devotes considerable senior management time 
and effort to its relationships with the investment 
consultancy firms to ensure that developments within 
the group and its investment research and processes 
are understood by these firms.any sustained period of poor investment 
performance reduces the value of aume in 
the group’s pooled funds and could lead to 
mandate terminations by clients and to loss of 
confidence in the group’s investment model 
by clients, potential clients and the investment 
consultants who advise them.the contents of these 
reports, which have been independently reviewed and 
tested by grant thornton uk llp , provide assurances 
of the group’s procedures and controls to mitigate 
operating risk.an external facilitator was identified and 
the group discussion took place in april 
2017, focusing on the board approach 
to business strategy and succession 
planning.the committee consists of 
the chief investment officer, the chief 
executive officer, the head of client team, 
the group chairman, the head of portfolio 
management, the head of economic 
research and fx strategy and the head 
of investment strategy.the committee 
meets as necessary responding both to 
internal developments and external events.the chief operating officer, the chief 
financial officer, the head of operations, 
the head of portfolio management, the 
head of portfolio implementation, the 
head of trading, the head of compliance 
and risk and the head of front office 
risk management are all members of the 
committee.when considering possible candidates, the 
committee evaluates the skills, knowledge 
and experience of the candidates and, in 
the case of non-executive appointments, 
their other commitments.the chair of the nomination committee 
will be available to answer any questions 
relating to the committee and its activities 
at the annual general meeting.record plc annual report 2017

overview of our audit approach
• overall group materiality: £393,000, which 
represents approximately 5% of the group’s 
profit before taxation;
• we performed full scope audit procedures 
for record plc, record currency 
management limited and record group 
services limited and targeted procedures 
for record currency management (us) inc. 
and record umbrella funds; and
• the key audit risk was identified as revenue 
recognition and occurrence.we also confirm that we do not have anything 
material to add or to draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation in the annual 
report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that 
describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether they have 
considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them, and their identification of 
any material uncertainties to the group’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation in the annual 
report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.ifrs 16 requires that all operating leases in excess of one year, where the group is the lessee, 
are included on the group’s statement of financial position.the group has investments in three funds.provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at 
the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation.1. during the year, the group introduced a new product classification (multi-product) and has restated the prior year analysis on the revised basis.there is no difference between the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings 
per share calculations.the group has controlled both the record currency – emerging market currency fund and the record currency – strategy development fund 
throughout the year ended 31 march 2017 and the comparative period, the year ended 31 march 2016, and both were consolidated in full, on 
a line-by-line basis in the group’s financial statements throughout these periods.part 1 of the 
record plc share scheme allows the grant of unapproved options to employees and directors and part 2 allows the grant of hmrc approved 
options to employees and directors.the group share-based payment expense in respect of the share scheme was £200,220 for the year ended 31 march 2017 (2016: £240,067).the impact of the valuation of the net assets of this seed fund is incorporated into
