insurance
the company has appropriate insurance cover in place in 
respect of any potential litigation against directors.each fully paid 
share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of 
the company.under company law the 
directors must not approve the accounts until 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company and 
the group and of the profit or loss of the group 
for that period.in preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
international accounting standard 1 requires 
that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the specific requirements in ifrs are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the group’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.we confirm that we 
have nothing 
material to report, 
add or draw 
attention to in 
respect of these 
matters.our audit work at the five locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than group materiality and ranged from £420,000 to £570,000 (2016: £110,000 to £430,500).matters on which we are required to report by exception

audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the group has estimated applying ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers as materially impacting the accounting for 
deferred revenue in the case of certain contracts.non-market vesting conditions 
include a change in control of the group and are considered by the directors at each year end.internally generated software is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of four to five years.for ‘available-for-sale’ investments, gains or losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised in other comprehensive income, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which 
time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the income statement for 
the period.deferred revenue is based on the ongoing cost of call 
handling and service costs and an appropriate profit margin.the above does not reflect additional net charges of central costs of £3,330,000, presented 
within uk and ireland in the table above, which has been charged to other regions for statutory purposes.77 financial statements notes to the financial statements continued
