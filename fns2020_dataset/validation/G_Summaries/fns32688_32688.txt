remuneration
annual report 
on remuneration redefine international p.l.c.in preparing each of the group and company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state that the financial statements of the group and company comply with ifrs as issued by the iasb and, in the case of the company, in accordance with those 
parts the isle of man companies acts 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company will continue in business.2 key audit matters: our assessment  
of risks of material misstatement 
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements and include 
the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by us, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team.this has been calculated 
with reference to a benchmark of total assets  
(of which it represents circa 1 per cent 
(2016: 1 per cent)), which we consider to 
be one of the principal considerations for 
members of the company in assessing the 
financial performance of the group.having considered the guidance in ifrs 10, 
the respective rights of each of the shareholders 
in redefinebdl and the relative size of the group’s 
shareholding, the directors have determined that 
the group has the ability to exercise significant 
influence over redefinebdl.the fair value of each award granted 
is calculated at the grant date, using the monte 
carlo and black‑scholes valuation methodologies.in the comparative segmental income statement, the group’s results from the last legacy asset, the hague, which was dis posed on 
31 august 2016, are also included; and
other: the group’s holding and management companies that carry out the head office and centralised asset management activities of the group.movements in the losses of the esplanade that are not recognised 
on an equity accounted basis during each reporting period are presented to reconcile segmental information to the ifrs statements.annual report 2017 116
7. disposal of subsidiaries 
no subsidiaries of the group were disposed of during the year ended 31 august 2017.
on 31 august 2016, the group disposed of its entire shareholding in cooperative redefine international real estate ua (netherlands) for a nominal consideration of €1.properties that have been 
classified as held for sale in the current year are also included so that the market value of the total portfolio can be determined.as detailed in the key judgements and estimates in 
note 2, aside from the group’s associate interest in redefinebdl and the receipt of rental income, redefine international is not involved in the hotel management 
business and there are limited transactions between redefine international, rhml and recml.shareholder approval was subsequently obtained for this related party transaction at an extraordinary general meeting on 
25 april 2017 and the leopard portfolio became a controlled subsidiary group on completion on 26 april 2017 but with economic effect from 1 march 2017.
the group’s joint venture equity and loan interests were derecognised on loss of joint control and the acquisition of control.the refinancing was not considered a 
significant modification and no extinguishment of the existing loan was therefore required;
• in june 2017, the group completed the refinancing of three facilities held with bayernlb in the ri menora joint venture.31 august 31 august
