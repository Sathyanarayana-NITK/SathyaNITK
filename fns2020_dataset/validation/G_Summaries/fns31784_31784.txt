the increase in net assets reflects the cash 
generation of the business, the return of cash to shareholders 
and investments in fixed assets.these are further 
described in the note on 
page 24.
brand and reputation
the whsmith brand is an important asset and 
failure to protect it from unfavourable publicity 
could materially damage its standing and the 
wider reputation of the business, adversely 
affecting revenues.retailing from a portfolio of good quality real estate in 
prime retail areas and key travel hubs at commercially 
reasonable rates remains critical to the performance 
of the group.we will continue to monitor the risks and uncertainties arising from brexit as part of the company’s risk management and control 
processes which are described on page 20.

regular private meetings with the external and internal auditors 
during the year .following its review, the committee advised the board that the

secure the better performance by an executive 
director of their duties.the company has provided and continues to provide an indemnity for its directors, which is a qualifying third party 
indemnity provision for the purposes of section 234 of the companies act 2006.
company’s shareholders
information provided to the company pursuant to the financial conduct authority’s (fca) disclosure guidance and transparency 
rules (dtrs) is published on a regulatory information service and on the company’s website.therefore, limited judgement or estimation was 
required in determining the amount the group is entitled to, 
as the majority of volume based agreements are based on 
historical sales as opposed to forecast volumes.where a store is loss making and 
is not expected to return to profitability in the near future, an 
impairment charge is recognised over the assets that cannot 
be recycled within the store portfolio as set out in note 14 
(property, plant and equipment).these, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole.going concern
in accordance with isas (uk) we report as follows:
reporting obligation outcome
we are required to report if we 
have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of the directors’ statement 
in the financial statements 
about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the 
directors’ identification of any 
material uncertainties to the 
group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern over a period 
of at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the 
financial statements.• the directors’ explanation on page 24 of the annual report as 
to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.use of this report
this report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
chapter 3 of part 16 of the companies act 2006 and for no other 
purpose.the types of supplier income recognised by the group, and the 
recognition policies are: 
retrospective discounts
income earned based on sales or purchase volume triggers set 
by the supplier for specific products over specific periods.any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.the consideration transferred is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, 
of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the group in exchange for control, 
of the acquiree.the acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively 
obtains control of the acquiree.these provisions represent 
the best estimate of the liability at the time of the balance sheet 
date, the actual liability being dependent on future events 
such as economic environment and marketplace demand.2
