adjusted ebitda margin (%) 
adjusted ebitda margin is operating  
profit from continuing operations before  
any exceptional items expressed as  
a percentage of total revenue.this measure is also  
the leverage measure used by the bank  
as a covenant compliance measure and  
is required to be below 2.5 times.the proportion to 
be distributed will be 20% of the excess if that excess is between £200,000 and £400,000, rising in increments of 1% for each additional 
£200,000 of the excess, up to a maximum of 30%.in our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 1 july 2017 and  
of the group’s profit for the period then ended;
 – the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the european union;
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with united kingdom generally accepted 
accounting practice; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies act 2006.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (uk) (isas (uk)) and applicable law.– checked the arithmetical accuracy and methodology behind the calculation of the value in use of the cgu.based on this work, we formed our own view as to the likelihood of future forecasts being achieved and discussed with management  
the key issues and sensitivities relating to the forecasts.we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the companies act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.– recognises the fair value of the consideration received.– recognises the fair value of any investment retained.measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality 
rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate.the following specific recognition 
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer.usually the risks and rewards of ownership transfer on despatch of the goods, however, for some customers, the risks and rewards of 
ownership pass to the buyer when the goods arrive with the buyer.gains or losses arising on 
initial recognition of both biological assets and agricultural produce and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which they arise.the defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less past service costs and actuarial 
gains and losses not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled.the present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension 
liability.any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation  
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in profit or loss.exceptional items
the group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense which, 
because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders  
to understand better the elements of financial performance in that year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better 
assess trends in financial performance.the group financial control team coordinates prepayments, accruals and provisions and these are not segmented.intangible assets
