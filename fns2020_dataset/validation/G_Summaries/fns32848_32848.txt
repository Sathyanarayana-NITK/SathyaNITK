www.breedongroup.com decisions in relation to 
directors’ remuneration 
in 2017
having conducted an external 
review and benchmarking of 
executive remuneration in late 
2015 in the context of setting the 
pay and benefits of the incoming 
group chief executive and other 
senior management, the 2017 
review focussed on the size of the 
group relative to its peers in the 
sector and of its recent increase in 
size following the acquisitions of 
hope, sherburn, and humberside 
aggregates in august 2017 .looking forward to 2018
no significant changes are 
proposed to our executive 
remuneration arrangements for 
2018. in accordance with breedon’s 
usual salary review timetable for 
the group as a whole, executive 
directors’ salaries for 2018 will 
be determined in march 2018. 
any increases to executive directors’ 
salaries are expected to be broadly 
in line with the range of increases 
awarded to the wider workforce, 
other than where a larger increase 
is considered appropriate to reflect 
any additional responsibilities 
arising as a result of the increase 
in the size of the group, and will 
be reported in the 2018 directors’ 
remuneration report.salaries are determined by reference to 
the skills and personal performance of the 
individual.maximum opportunity
in line with best and market practice, it 
is currently intended that rolling annual 
awards will be made.it will 
continually monitor the composition of the senior management team, including the executive directors, and taking 
into account factors such as age, experience and career progression opportunities, it will formulate plans well in 
advance of potential vacancies arising.• if the circumstances of the recruitment make it appropriate to provide relocation, travel and subsistence payments.further details of the key areas of risk to the 
business identified by the group are included on pages 19 to 21. details of the group’s operational key performance 
indicators are shown on page 18.

time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the companies (jersey) law 1991. they are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
