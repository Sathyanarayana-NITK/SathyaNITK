in october 2017, 
we announced a second caretech sharesave 
scheme and 259 members of staff chose to 
join this new saving scheme.however, the market has been steadily 
consolidating and a very small number 
of large “corporate” providers have emerged, 
with caretech being one of the bigger 
players within the non-elderly care sector.03p
(2016: 38.03p)
how this is calculated
underlying basic earnings per share is the profit after tax divided 
by the weighted number of ordinary shares which are fully 
described in notes 10 and 11 to the financial statements.these improvements have put us in a strong 
position to benefit from a number of the 
commissioning opportunities by working in 
partnership with the nhs and local authorities.the group has continued to develop and 
grow its existing five operating divisions, 
which come under the two outcome-based 
sectors of adult services and children 
services.strategic review governance – – financial statements

the board meets in formal session regularly, usually once each month, 
and members are supplied with financial and operational information 
in good time for scrutiny in advance of these meetings.in addition, the directors will be able to impose limits or 
conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.for the group’s 
services the published reports are as follows with the services in 
the outcomes as set out:
ratings outstanding good
requires 
improvement inadequate
national 1% 71% 26% 2%
caretech – 82% 17% 1%
adult services in wales are regulated under different national legislation 
and are not currently rated on any form of scale, though all are 
compliant.the care governance and safeguarding committee works in close 
association with the group’s internal regulatory compliance team who 
operate across all divisions, reporting direct to the ceo.they have overseen the further development 
of processes and procedures for identifying, analysing and managing 
the significant risks faced by the group.by order of the board

strategic review governance – – financial statements
caretech holdings plc – annual report and accounts 2017 39 the directors confirm that: 
 – so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and
 – the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor 
is aware of that information.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.– we performed substantive analytical procedures 
on revenue based on occupancy numbers across 
the group.42 caretech holdings plc – annual report and accounts 2017
independent auditor’s report
to the members of caretech holdings plc continued our application of materiality
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.the consolidated financial statements 
of the company for the year ended 30 september 2017 comprise the 
company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”).2 accounting policies
(a) applicable accounting standards
the group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the directors in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu (“adopted ifrss”) and those parts of 
the companies act 2006 relevant to those companies which report 
in accordance with ifrs.the directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed below, 
other than ifrs 16, will not have a material impact on the financial 
information of the group in future reporting periods.goodwill represents the 
excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired on acquisition of 
subsidiaries.the cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of 
materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to 
bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use 
and capitalised borrowing costs.the costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, 
plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.in either 
scenario, the group reviews whether the debt is accounted for as a 
modification or an extinguishment of the liability.both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the 
modification are taken into account to ascertain whether the 
medication is substantial and these can include the change in 
covenants, repayment dates and the effective interest rate.a provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under 
short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result 
of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.7 staff numbers and costs
the average number of persons employed by the group (including directors) during the year, analysed by category, was as follows:
number of employees

derivative financial instruments (note 5) 895 1,904
ias 17 lease imputed interest (note 5) 223 133
total financial expenses 5,888 7,924
in accordance with ias 23, borrowing costs at £262,000 (2016: £150,000) have been capitalised in the year on qualifying assets within property 
plant and equipment.the capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs capitalised is 5%.the directors believe that, even in the current economic and public spending environment and taking into account the nature of the group’s 
operations, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the cash-
generating units’ carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.approved and unapproved scheme options are exercisable at any time from the third anniversary of the date of grant to the tenth anniversary, 
other than nominal cost options which may become exercisable at the earliest after a period of 30 dealing days following the third anniversary 
of being granted.the following table of fair values summarises the acquisition made during the financial year.on 19 june 2017 the group acquired the equity of selborne care limited, which provides a range of supported living, residential care and 
day opportunity services in birmingham, sandwell, coventry and warwickshire, worcestershire, wolverhampton, bristol, south gloucestershire, 
bath and north east somerset, devon, plymouth and cornwall.varying approval levels are set on the 
extension of credit depending upon the value of the sale.
