delivering our commitments
we’re here to connect people across 
europe for work and leisure.its crew are trained to assess all situations to ensure that the 
safety of the flight and passengers is not compromised at any 
time.this includes the use of 
one engine taxiing, installation of lightweight recaro seats, 
and the use of electronic devices rather than numerous paper 
documents in the flight deck.easyjet believes that if there is a need to control the tourism 
activity in a particular area then this should be done by the 
relevant local authorities, taking account of the economic 
benefit of tourism.the nominations committee led 
the process to appoint the new chief executive, with support 
from the other non-executive directors throughout the 
process.her logistics and transport background and ftse 100 ceo 
experience have already served to strengthen the diverse 
mix of expertise and experience on the board.the views of 
shareholders and market perceptions are also communicated 
to the board via presentations by the head of investor 
relations at least every quarter.the chief financial officer and general counsel have 
also met separately with representatives of easygroup ltd  
(an affiliate of easygroup holdings limited) to discuss matters 
relating to the management and protection of the “easyjet” 
and “easy” brands.corporate governance report / continued

the committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements.• the committee considered a detailed review of the 
assumptions underpinning aircraft residual value estimates 
along with the treatment of the sale of 10 a319 aircraft in 
december 2016 and their immediate lease back.in carrying out the above processes, key considerations 
included ensuring that there was consistency between the 
accounts and the narrative provided in the front half of the 
annual report, and that there was an appropriate balance 
between the reporting of weaknesses, difficulties and 
challenges, as well as successes, in an open and 
balanced manner.the annual 
statement by the chairman of the remuneration committee (set out on pages 65 to 66) and the annual report on 
remuneration (set out on pages 75 to 84) will together be subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming agm.specifically, the policy 
incorporates additional flexibility with regard to the specific 
measures and weightings which will be used for the ltip to 
ensure that any measures and targets are fully aligned with 
the strategic imperatives prevailing at the time they are set.executive directors receive benefits provisions at similar levels as the 
wider uk workforce.in relation to a termination of employment, the committee 
may make any statutory entitlements or payments to settle 
or compromise claims in connection with a termination of 
any existing or future executive director as necessary.50% of vesting was based on relative tsr performance compared to companies ranked ftse 51-150. three year average roce 
(including lease adjustments) was 20.0% and the company was ranked at the 94th percentile versus ftse 51-150 companies in terms of tsr; 
correspondingly 100% of these awards vested in december 2015. the following targets applied for these awards:
