on a reported basis, revenue 
increased by 9.1 per cent to us$428.8 million 
(2016 restated: us$393.1 million), principally 
due to the full year contribution of bilco, to 
the division in the year.the largest contributor to the improved 
profitability was the delivery of increased 
synergy benefits during the year.despite lower sales, profitability in latin america 
remained in line with the previous year due 
to the savings made from the consolidation 
of the brazilian sites that took place towards 
the end of 2016. the latin american region 
remains profitable and cash generative and 
makes an operating margin in line with the 
rest of the division.the group continues to target a roce of 15.0 per cent over the medium term.based on the 
work undertaken to date, the adoption of 
ifrs 9 is not expected to have a material 
impact on the group financial statements.an annual review is performed on the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control.the heat map 
shows the board’s assessment of the principal 
risks before any mitigating controls and actions.the new gdpr could 
increase the cost of failures to protect 
the group’s digital assets.the schlegelgiesse contribution 
was aimed at the removal of architectural 
barriers in the club, to help people of all 
abilities participate in this sport.following the amalgamation of the italian 
sites, schlegelgiesse completed an energy 
audit at the start of 2017 which mapped all 
energy consumption, to provide the basis on 
which energy reduction programmes can 
target key areas.details 
of this review process are set out in the 
audit committee report on page 63.

financial reporting
the annual report and accounts are 
intended to provide a balanced and clear 
assessment of the group’s past performance, 
present position and future prospects.the group’s 
performance during this time has been 
highly impressive, as can be seen in the 
chart of tyman total shareholder return 
relative to that of the ftse all share index 
set out on page 78. whilst this assessment 
indicated that a more significant increase in 
louis’ salary might be justified, the 
committee decided to award him an 
increase of 3.2 per cent, taking his salary 
from £407,000 to £420,000, having taken 
into account the more modest increases 
being awarded throughout the group and 
the increase in variable pay opportunity he 
now had for 2018. as discussed above, 
james brotherton’s salary is to remain at 
£297,500 for 2018.
the salaries of the group’s senior 
management team were also reviewed 
in december 2017 and in general were 
awarded an increase to their base salaries 
of 2.0 per cent, these being in line with 
the average increases for all uk-based 
employees, excluding exceptional increases 
reflecting local operating or market 
conditions in the various geographies 
where tyman operates.the terms of reference are available on the group’s website.performance metrics based on cumulative underlying eps measured 
over a three-year period, and subject to discretionary relative total shareholder return and absolute roce underpins.a dividend equivalent provision allows 
the payment of dividends, at the 
committee’s discretion on vested 
shares at the time of vesting.although the committee does not consult directly with employees on the directors’ 
remuneration policy, the committee does consider the general basic salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions 
for the broader employee population when determining remuneration policy for the executive directors.• 
benefits are the value of benefits paid in the year ended 31 december 2017, as set out in the table of directors’ remuneration on page 74.independence
we remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the uk, which includes the frc’s ethical standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.given both recent 
and forecast trading, the directors are of the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future is more likely than not to be sufficient to 
recover these assets.schlegelgiesse is the cgu with the smallest absolute viu headroom.given that the ebitda margin in 2017 was 14.0 per cent and the margin uplift potential for the 
enlarged division once realised, this scenario is unlikely to occur.subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, 
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the specific asset will flow to the group and the cost 
of the subsequent item can be measured reliably.16.1.2 cash flow hedges
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income.key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.• 
the directors’ explanation on page 42 of the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the parent company, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the parent company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
