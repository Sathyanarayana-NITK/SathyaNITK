when making remuneration decisions, to ensure there is a fair and 
consistent approach to remuneration, the committee considers pay 
and employment conditions across the group, such as determination of 
salary increases to executive directors with reference to the range of base 
pay increases within the group.under uk company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the group and parent company 
in respect of that financial period.under the listing rules we are required to review:  
— the directors’ statements, set out on pages 60 and 25, 
in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; 
and      
— the part of the corporate governance report on page 
37 relating to the company’s compliance with the 
eleven provisions of the 2014 uk corporate 
governance code specified for our review.at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but are either not yet effective or 
have not yet been adopted by the eu:
 • ifrs 9 financial instruments 
 • ifrs 1 5 revenue from contracts with customers
 • ifrs 16 leases
 • amendments to ifrs 2 classification and measurement of share-based 
payment transactions
 • amendments to ias 7 disclosure initiative
 • amendments to ias 1 2 recognition of deferred t ax assets for 
unrealised losses
 • amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 sale or contribution of assets 
between an investor and its associate or joint venture
 • annual improvements 2014–2016 cycle
ifrs 9 financial instruments was issued by the iasb in july 2014 and 
becomes effective for the group for the year ended 31 march 201 9. 
applying ifrs 9 will result in changes to the measurement and disclosure 
of financial instruments and introduces a new expected loss impairment 
model.the calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit method.impairment losses recognised in respect 
of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the amount of 
goodwill allocated to the applicable cash-generating unit and then 
to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a 
pro rata basis.when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the 
hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain 
or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance 
with the above policy when the transaction takes place.the principal wincanton scheme in the uk (the scheme) is a funded arrangement which has three defined benefit sections and two defined 
contribution sections, called the wincanton retirement savings section and the wincanton pension builder plan.2017

the movement in the above net defined benefit liability in the year was primarily the result of an increase in the market value of the investments, a 
reduction in liabilities due to demographic assumptions and contributions received from the group, being partly offset by an increase in liabilities 
resulting from a fall in the discount rate.transactions with executive and non-executive directors
