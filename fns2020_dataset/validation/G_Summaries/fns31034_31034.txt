explore potential bolt-on acquisitions 
in february 2017, we completed the acquisition of 
security hardware, a supplier of locks and hardware 
primarily to the rmi market.the role of the committee includes ensuring the 
timely identification and robust management of inherent and 
emerging risks, by reviewing the suitability and effectiveness 
of risk management processes and controls.the board considers these tests to  
be sufficient to test the viability of the 
group given the size of the group  
and the markets it operates within.the board has delegated specific responsibilities to the 
nomination, audit and risk and remuneration committees.day-to-day management and the implementation of strategies 
agreed by the board are delegated to the executive directors.board composition, commitment and  
election of directors
the nomination committee leads the process for board 
appointments and makes recommendations to the board.the company secretary is also 
secretary to the remuneration committee and the audit and 
risk committee, and attends meetings for this purpose.during the year the nomination committee held two scheduled 
meetings.the committee noted that there continues to be 
considerable management focus on both the optimisation of 
finished goods inventory levels and, looking forward, on the 
operational controls over the management of inventory.the schedule of authorisation limits was 
updated in december 2016, to reflect the development of the 
business since its ipo, and approved by the board.the committee worked with kpmg to set the programme for 
internal audit in 2017, which included reviews over the group’s 
risk management systems, payroll, cyber security, gdpr 
readiness and management’s branch audit process.work of the committee during the year
the committee met two times during 2017. the main 
committee activities during the year (full details of which are set 
out in the relevant sections of this report) included:
• agreeing the performance against the targets and payout for 
the 2016 annual bonus awards.• long-term incentives
 psp awards are expected to be made in april 2018.  
award levels will be set at 100% of salary for mark kelly and 
michael scott.in terms of the principles for setting a package  
for a new executive director, the starting point for 
the committee will be to apply the general policy 
for executive directors as set out above and 
structure a package in accordance with that 
policy.the committee 
does not at present consider it appropriate to publish such data in this report as it is concerned that no common methodology has 
yet been established amongst uk companies and their investors for these comparisons.strategic report
as permitted by section 414c of the companies act 2006, 
certain information required to be included in the directors’ 
report has been included in the strategic report, which is set 
out on pages 4 to 39. specifically, this relates to information on 
the group’s strategy, business model, likely future developments 
and risk management.results
our financial statements for year ended 31 december 2017 are 
set out on pages 69 to 109. the financial statements should be 
read in conjunction with the chief executive’s review, divisional 
reviews and the group financial review.it is determined by the board 
and overseen by the audit and risk committee.the board of directors may exercise all the powers of the 
company, subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, the 
company’s articles of association and any directions given by 
the company in general meetings.the powers of the directors 
include those in relation to the issue and buyback of shares.copies of the service contracts of the executive directors and 
the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors are 
available for inspection at the company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and will be available for inspection 
at the company’s agm.as permitted by the act, the company’s articles of association 
enable directors to authorise actual or potential conflicts of 
interest.we have audited the financial statements, included within the annual report and accounts 2017 (the “annual report”), which 
comprise: the consolidated and company statements of financial position as at 31 december 2017; the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated and company statements of changes  
in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.these matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.in addition, we also focused on these areas because the 
incentive schemes of the directors and senior management  
are based upon financial measures including profit, which we 
concluded gave a greater risk of manipulation of judgements, 
including those around trade receivables provisions, to ensure 
that bonus targets are achieved.our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their 
statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the uk corporate governance code (the 
“code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability 
carried in the balance sheet.the amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).the total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill, as assessed by the directors using the above assumptions, is greater than the 
carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been recorded.based upon current economic and market trends, management consider that the sterling libor rate will remain relatively stable 
during the next reporting period to 31 december 2018, and any changes, when applied to the group’s current bank borrowings of 
£25,851,000 would not lead to a significant change in finance expense.the timing of the utilisation of the provision is variable dependent on the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary 
between 1 and 10 years.
