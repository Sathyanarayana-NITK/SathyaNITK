charge are provided in note 6.
on a statutory unadjusted basis the group had an 
effective tax rate of 21.0% (2015/16: 12.1%), based  
on a tax charge of £16.8m and total profit for the  
year of £79.7m.the cash  
tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate mainly  
as a result of the use of losses within the group  
and the timing of tax instalment payments.during the year the chairman became chairman of the ftse 
smallcap multi-channel retailer, findel plc.internal audit

function and the director of internal audit reports directly

of items included in the exceptional cost of £8.8m, together 
with the recognition criteria and measurement bases for the 
element provided for at the balance sheet date.the committee is of the view  
that management has appropriately treated such items in  
the financial statements.the committee also receives and considers an update paper 
covering the group’s ongoing direct tax issues at both the half 
and full year.additionally, details of the 
financial risks that the group faces can be found in note 19

the annual report and financial statements are the 
responsibility of, and have been approved by, the directors.for the 
remaining eight (2015/16: seven) components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit procedures on specific 
accounts within that component that we considered had the 
potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts  
in the financial statements either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile.opinions on other matters prescribed by  
the companies act 2006
in our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
companies act 2006.
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:
◊ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and 
those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements;
◊ the information about internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about 
share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 
and 7.2.6 in the disclosure rules and transparency rules 
sourcebook made by the financial conduct authority (the 
fca rules), is consistent with the financial statements and  
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements; and
◊ information about the company’s corporate governance code 
and practices and about its administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 
7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the fca rules.in preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group and company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
group or the company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.◊ as the gaming industry is highly regulated, we have obtained 
an understanding of the regulations and the potential impact 
on the group and in assessing the control environment  
we have considered the compliance of the group to these 
regulations as part of our audit procedures, which included  
a review of correspondence received from the regulator.the full impact of ifrs 16 on the group is currently being 
assessed, including the practical application of the principles  
of the standard to the group’s leases, and it is therefore not  
yet possible to provide a reasonable estimate of its effect.in the current year, the reporting of operating segments has 
been modified following changes in management responsibilities 
and reporting to the chief operating decision-maker.where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the  
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to 
the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating 
unit) in prior years.the company also makes awards of its own shares to employees 
of its subsidiaries and as such recognises an increase in the cost 
of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled 
share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ 
financial statements, with the corresponding credit being 
recognised directly in equity.it is the group’s policy to balance the need to maintain auditor independence with the benefit of taking advice from the leading 
firm in the area concerned and the desirability of being efficient.as a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the  
value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to casinos and have been based on historic trends.
