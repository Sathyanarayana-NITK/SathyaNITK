of the underlying growth in self-pay 
revenue of 12.0%:
• an increase of 6.5% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 4.4% increase in self-pay revenue in the year;
• the average revenue per case for self-pay in-patient and daycase admissions grew by 7.9% over the prior year, contributing 5.7% 
to the increase in self-pay revenue in the year.for the year ended 31 december 2017, the charge to the income statement was £1.0 million (2016: £0.4 million), 
or £1.1 million inclusive of national insurance (2016: £0.6 million).“as a result, we’ve extended our 
programme of information and 
educational events to this the 
wider primary care audience, 
explaining the benefits of new 
services and equipment, building 
relationships between them and 
our consultants, and making the 
referral process as easy as possible.the team generally meets twice a month and 
its members are shown on pages 58 to 59.
key objectives:
• assists the chief executive officer in discharging his responsibilities;
• ensures a direct line of authority from any member of staff to the 
chief executive officer; and
• assists in making executive decisions affecting the company.there is also an agreed procedure in place 
for directors, in the furtherance of their 
duties, to take independent legal advice, 
if necessary, at the group’s expense.the group company secretary records 
the consideration of any conflict and 
any authorisations granted.external financial reporting
the committee is responsible for 
monitoring, reviewing and challenging the 
integrity of the financial statements, and 
ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory 
and statutory requirements, giving due 
consideration to the provisions of the 
uk corporate governance code.the committee took into 
account its own knowledge of the group, 
its strategy and performance in the year, 
internal verification of the factual content, 
comprehensive review undertaken at 
different levels in the group to ensure 
consistency and overall balance, and 
detailed review by senior management and 
the external auditor.the committee was 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the annual 
report and accounts for the year ended 
2017 is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and has affirmed that view to the board.further details can be found 
in our people on page 46.
annual evaluation of the  
committee’s performance
the evaluation of the committee’s 
performance was carried out in november 
2017 which confirmed that it continued 
to perform effectively.the group company secretary, or their appointed nominee, acts as secretary to 
the committee.re-election of directors
the committee met in early 2018 to 
review the continuation in office, and 
potential re-appointment, of all members 
of the board.the board appoints the chair of the committee, who must be either the chairman of the 
board or an independent non-executive director.the committee retains discretion to make 
higher increases in certain circumstances, 
for example, following an increase in the 
scope and/or responsibility of the role, or a 
significant change in market practice or the 
development of the individual in the role.the committee is satisfied 
that the above provisions provide robust 
safeguards against inappropriate payment 
of incentive awards.any benefits provided will be reasonable in the market context and 
take account of the individual circumstances and benefits provided to 
comparable roles.the appointment of any independent non-executive director is terminable by either the group or the director 
by giving two months’ notice.retirement benefits
the amount set out in the table represents the group contribution to the executive directors’ retirement planning at a rate of 
18% of base salary.the committee are satisfied that the 
target ranges for the 2018 awards are suitably stretching in the context of current expectations and that the hurdles 
at the top-end of the range would suitably justify full vesting.the target range has been adapted to reflect expected 
changes in the stringency of the external regulatory review process and the benchmarks required to achieve a ‘good’ rating.following simon gordon’s decision to step down as a director of spire healthcare group plc on 1 march 2018, he will be leaving 
the business on 31 march 2018. his contract of employment is terminable on 12 months’ notice which the company intends 
to pay to him when he leaves the business.this report on directors’ 
remuneration will be put to an advisory vote at the annual general meeting on 24 may 2018. the directors confirm that this 
report has been prepared in accordance with the companies act 2006 and reflects the provisions of the large and medium-sized 
companies and groups (accounts & reports) (amendment) regulations 2013 and was approved at a meeting of the directors held 
on 1 march 2018. the company’s remuneration policy was approved at its annual general meeting in 2015 and received 99.56% 
of the vote in favour from shareholders.it is next intended that the remuneration policy will be put to a binding vote at the annual 
general meeting on 24 may 2018.

registered office
the company’s registered office and 
principal place of business is 3 dorset rise, 
london ec4y 8en.given management’s bonus structure 
and the pressure to achieve the agreed 
performance target, we consider there 
to be a risk of financial reporting 
manipulation by management.based on the key performance indicators 
that are analysed by both external and 
internal parties, we consider revenue to 
be susceptible to management override 
of control as this forms the foundation 
for the key performance indicators.we determined materiality for the parent company to be the same as materiality for the group.115
