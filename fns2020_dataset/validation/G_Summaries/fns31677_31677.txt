and advisors
the objectives of the remuneration 
policy are to ensure that the overall 
remuneration of senior executives is 
aligned with the performance of the 
group and preserves an appropriate 
balance of annual profit delivery and 
longer-term shareholder value.in preparing 
these financial statements, the 
directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable;
• state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with ifrs, 
as adopted by the eu; 
• assess the group and parent 
company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and
• use the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the group or 
the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.6.  we have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
under the companies act 2006, we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.7. respective responsibilities

assessing the group and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
