the group’s focus is on international expansion through the distribution and marketing of our brands  
in the important us, european and asia pacific markets.a programme of investments in the latest 
cad and printing technology has positioned 
standfast at the forefront of the digital 
revolution in fabric printing with a rapidly 
expanding customer base around the world.under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company and of the 
profit or loss of the group and company for that period.the performance measurement of the executive directors and the 
determination of their annual remuneration package, including 
performance targets, is undertaken by the remuneration committee.part way through the year, due to hmrc changes in tax 
relief, the remuneration committee agreed a cash allowance in lieu  
of pension contribution, for those who wished to opt out of the plan.for the purposes of determining employer contributions to that 
scheme, annual performance-related bonuses are not included in  
the pensionable pay of the executive directors.the performance conditions for the 2014 and 2015 awards are based 
both on compound growth in adjusted eps* and relative tsr against a 
comparator group of aim companies.further details of the work of the committee is 
contained in the audit committee chairman’s report on page 46.

audit committee report
each meeting is attended by the committee’s members as well as, by 
invitation, the executive directors and the external auditor.in addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required 
to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the report of the directors.in addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit.the group has not applied the following new standards, amendments and interpretations for which adoption is not mandatory for the year ending 
31 january 2017 and/or which have not yet been endorsed by the eu.foreign currencies

currency of the company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.the amount of the provision is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘other operating income/(expense)’.the group has no embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host instrument.the group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the group’s financial performance.the quantification of these obligations is subject to significant estimates 
and assumptions regarding life expectancy, discount and inflation rates, wage and salary changes, the rate of increase in pension payments, and 
the market values of equities, bonds and other pension assets.the recoverable 
amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use (‘viu’) calculations.the cash flows have not included the benefits 
arising from any future asset enhancement expenditure and therefore exclude significant benefits anticipated from future capital expenditure.plan assets held in the fund are governed by local regulations and practice in the uk.responsibility for the governance of the plan, including 
investment decisions and contributions schedules, lies with the trustees of the schemes.31 january 2017

what an audit of financial statements involves
we conducted our audit in accordance with isas (uk & ireland).this includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.notes to the financial statements

the company’s non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other liabilities’.the use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the group’s policies approved 
by the board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments.the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within administration expenses.deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in 
a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.c) long-term incentive plan payment awards
the company has granted awards to executive directors and senior management which include vesting conditions relating to the future financial 
performance of the group as measured by adjusted profit before tax (‘pbt’) and the relative performance of the group’s total shareholder return 
(‘tsr’) against comparator companies.the table below analyses the company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to contractual 
maturity at the balance sheet date.
