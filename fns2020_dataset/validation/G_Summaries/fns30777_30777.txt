auditor
in accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the companies act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of deloitte llp as auditor 
is to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.the committee has the authority to seek any 
information that is required, from any officer or 
employee of the company or its subsidiaries.the 
committee has sought to ensure that appointments are of the best candidates to promote the 
success of the company and are based on merit, with due regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the board.the 
committee, having reviewed their independence and contribution to board matters, confirms that the performance of each of the directors 
standing for re-election at this year’s agm continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles, including independence 
of judgement and time commitment for board and committee meetings.in accordance with the transition arrangements of the competition and markets authority audit order, the group has until 2023 to hold  
a competitive tender for external audit services; it is the intention of the group to hold a competitive tender, at a time which coincides  
with the next change of the lead audit partner, as the committee believes that the audit partner’s knowledge of the business contributes  
to the quality of the audit process.based on this, and as a result of the work done during the year, the committee has concluded 
that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and carried out its responsibilities effectively.annual bonus
improved profitability alongside tight controls on working capital and a focus on higher value added businesses have enabled us to deliver  
a headline operating profit of £123.9m (an increase of 24% on 2016) together with a headline operating cash flow of £111 .7m.in determining the appropriate fee level the committee considered market benchmarking against the ftse 250 and other 
companies of comparable size and complexity in line with our approved policy set out in section b of this report.scheme interests awarded in the financial year
cip awards granted during the year
no awards were made under the cip – the final award was made in 2015 with vesting occurring in may 2018. this plan no longer features in 
the company’s policy.the provision of other benefits payable to 
an executive director is reviewed by the 
committee on an annual basis to ensure 
appropriateness in terms of the type and level 
of benefits provided.executive directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors.statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the group
the company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not 
require the company to pay any more than is necessary.the initial notice period may be longer than the company’s one year policy (up to a maximum of two years).in order to provide the company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment 
scenario, the committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary.this level of variable pay would only be 
available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets 
would need to be met.the 
committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection 
with such agreements.materiality the materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £5.6 million which was determined on the 
basis of 5% of expected pre-tax profit.where a group company transacts with an associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in 
the relevant associate.for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.at each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
