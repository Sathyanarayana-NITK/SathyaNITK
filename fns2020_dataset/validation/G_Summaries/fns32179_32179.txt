proposed energy price cap
it is encouraging that both the major political parties included a commitment in their recent general election 
manifestos to address one of the main issues within the energy industry, namely the practice by many large 
suppliers of using the higher margins earned on disengaged legacy customers to offer significantly cheaper 
deals which are only available to those who switch.magazine for the quality of the service and support provided to our members, 
and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from members in our own surveys.the sale resulted in the receipt of £71.1m of cash and an exceptional 
profit from the sale of £62.3m.the group has full strategic control over the source code behind its billing and membership management 
system, thereby removing any risk of future software development not being able to meet the precise 
requirements of the group.however, 
as the infrastructure is generally shared with other suppliers, any material disruption to the supply of 
services is likely to impact a large part of the market as a whole and it is unlikely that the group would 
be disproportionately affected.beatrice hollond, non-executive director
beatrice, aged 56, is a member of the board of brown advisory, a 
non-executive director of m&g limited, a non-executive director at 
templeton emerging markets investment trust, chairman at millbank 
investment managers, chairman at keystone investment trust and non-
executive director and chairman of the audit committee at henderson 
smaller companies investment trust.this review 
was conducted by the deputy chairman and company secretary and principally covered the following 
areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board evaluation questionnaires, individual directors’ 
performances and key objectives for the coming year, and the identification of any specific training and 
development requirements.the board believes that the addition of two new independent non-executive directors to the board during 
the year has strengthened the company’s compliance with one of the key supporting principles of the 
code in relation to the composition of the board, namely that the board should include an appropriate 
combination of executive and non-executive directors (and, in particular, independent non-executive 
directors) such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the board’s decision making.the board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the company (including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management) and the principal risks which the company 
faces during the year.during the year the audit committee reviewed and approved the company’s half year and annual financial 
statements.it meets regularly to review and set all elements of the 
remuneration paid to the executive directors of the company, including pension rights, and monitors the 
level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the company.it also exercises all the 
powers of the board in relation to the operation of the company’s share incentive schemes, including the 
grant of options and the terms of those grants.the committee met formally three times during the year and details of attendance at these meetings are 
provided in the corporate governance statement on page 39.
the committee’s principal activities during the year included:
• reviewing and approving executive director remuneration packages;
• monitoring senior management remuneration packages;
•  reviewing and approving the issue of share options to certain employees and independent distributors of 
the company; and
• overseeing the implementation of the new ltip 2016 following shareholder approval.bonus to be paid at

subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the 
company’s employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the company, 
the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.one of the key drivers behind the introduction of ltip 2016 is the retention of key individuals over the longer 
term, therefore any growth shares issued to a participant will generally lapse if they cease to be employed by 
the company before they have vested.a summary of the principal terms of the ltip 2016 was included in the appendix to the 2016 agm circular 
sent to all shareholders.other than as set out below and so far as the directors are aware, there were no arrangements at 31 
march 2017 by which, with the company’s co-operation, financial rights carried by securities are held 
by a person other than a holder of securities, or any arrangements between holders of securities that are 
known to the company and which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.directors’ report
