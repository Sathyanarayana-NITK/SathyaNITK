annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 auditors’ responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion.the non-controlling 
shareholders interest in the acquiree 
is initially measured at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportion 
of the net fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised.the consolidated financial statements 
are presented in pounds sterling and 
rounded to the nearest thousand.the stage of completion is determined 
relative to the total number of hours 
expected to complete the work or 
provision of services.the land and buildings elements of 
property leases are considered 
separately for the purposes of 
lease classification.if any such 
condition exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent, if any, 
of the impairment loss.provisions are not recognised for 
future operating losses.employee share ownership plan 
(‘esop’)
as the company is deemed to have 
control of its esop trust, it is treated 
as a subsidiary and consolidated for 
the purposes of the group financial 
statements.non-market vesting 
conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of equity 
investments expected to vest at each 
year-end date so that, ultimately, the 
cumulative amount recognised over 
the vesting period is based on the 
number of options that eventually vest.strategic report corporate governance financial statements

notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 december 2017
the following new standard has been 
published that is mandatory to the 
group’s future accounting periods but 
has not been adopted early in these 
financial statements.the directors are in the process of 
reviewing contracts to identify any 
additional lease arrangements that 
would need to be recognised under 
ifrs 16. ifrs 16 eliminates the two 
lease classifications that ias 17 has 
(operating and finance leases) for 
the lessee, and instead all leases 
will have the same classification.68 ebiquity plc
