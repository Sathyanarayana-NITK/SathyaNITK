group or the parent company in the period from 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017.we gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in
which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group, which were contrary to applicable laws and
regulations, including fraud.we have evaluated the growth assumptions
adopted by the directors in respect of online handle, via
reference to historic growth rates.these include the disposal of the football
pools division and the gain arising from the successful
spot the ball claim.these, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and
disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial
statements as a whole.80

in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
strategic report and directors’ report for the year ended 31 december 2017 is consistent with the financial
statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.the directors are also responsible for such internal control as
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.critical judgments include the valuation of assets disposed of in the football pools deal, the period in which
those assets arose, and the valuation of management supplies provided by the executive management team to
its subsidiaries.sportech plc annual report and accounts 2017

the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary

presentation currency as follows:

balance sheet;
–        income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this
average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
transactions); and
