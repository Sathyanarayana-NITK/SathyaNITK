annual report and accounts 2014
joint chief executives’ review  and finance report property valuation
the value of the total portfolio under 
management has increased by £135.8 million  
or 9.2% from december 2013. the wholly 
owned portfolio increased by £62.9 million with 
the three uk funds increasing by £73.0 million.we 
have hedged 80% of the interest on the loan, 
resulting in an interest cost of 3.5% per annum 
at the time of re nancing, excluding fees.the 
valuation uplift subsequent to the acquisition 
of the entire portfolio was £19.5 million.after taking into account the various currency 
hedges, even in a particularly stressed position 
of the euro collapsing by 16.8% to €1 .50:£1 
from the year end rate, the group would only 
lose approximately £24.0 million or 3.6%  
of its net asset value.there is also a risk that one or 
more of the countries that the group operates 
in could leave the euro which may affect the 
nature of the group’s loans and derivatives 
or introduce new volatility and currency 
exposures for the group to manage.31

hansteen holdings plc
financial statements 1. general information
hansteen holdings plc is a company which was incorporated in the united kingdom and registered in england and 
wales on 27 october 2005. the company is required to comply with the provisions of the companies act 2006. the 
address of the registered of ce is 1st floor, pegasus house, 37-43 sackville street, london w1s 3dl.revenue recognition
revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, vat and other sales-related taxes.where a property is held under a head lease 
it is initially recognised as an asset as the sum of the premium paid on acquisition and the present value of minimum 
ground rent payments.deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised.if 
the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the 
transferred asset, the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may 
have to pay.where an existing  nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi ed, such an exchange or modi cation is treated as a 
de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognised in the income statement.the tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the pro t per the income statement as follows:

the impairment in the year relates to the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries being higher than the net assets of 
that particular investment.the impact of the rate change is 
not signi cant to the group.at 31 december 2014 the group had currency options in place to buy £215.1 
million for €283.5 million.the balance is low relative to both the 
current and net assets of the group and the company.principal activities
the company is the parent company of a group whose 
principal activities comprise property investment, 
development, management and associated business, 
focussing on industrial property investments in 
continental europe and the uk, although it will also 
seek to pro t from opportunistic acquisitions in other 
property sectors both in the uk and abroad.the subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the 
pro ts or net assets of the group in the year are listed 
in note 18 to the  nancial statements.landaid 
uses the collective resources, expertise and in"uence 
of the property industry to help disadvantaged young 
people in the uk access the buildings, skills and 
opportunities they need to achieve their potential.responsibility statement 
we con rm that to the best of our knowledge:
 •  the  nancial statements, prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the european union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities,  nancial 
position and pro t or loss of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole;
 •  the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; 
and
 •  the annual report and  nancial statements, taken 
as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.in particular, changes in assumptions 
such as the time a property will remain vacant when a 
tenant leaves, the rent free period required to attract 
a new tenant, and the level of expenditure required 
to maintain the property can lead to signi cant 
movements in the value of the property, as can changes 
in the underlying market conditions.•  we met with management’s third party valuers 
of the german, uk and netherlands property 
portfolios to con rm their independence, the 
scope of the work they were requested to perform 
by management, and the valuation process 
applied.the 
group audit team performed the audits of the entities in the united 
kingdom and germany, and a component auditor performed the 
audits of the entities in the netherlands based on instructions from 
the group audit team.under international standards on auditing (uk and ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
 •  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
 nancial statements; or
 •  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 •  otherwise misleading.the appointment of new directors is a matter for the 
board as a whole, following recommendations made 
by the nomination committee.the significant issues considered by the 
committee in relation to the financial 
statements were:
 •  valuation and presentation of the long-term 
incentive plan (“ltip”) charge
 •  hbi netherlands transaction
 •  cash box accounting for the share issue
 •  investment property valuations
 •  going concern, debt maturity and covenant 
compliance 
 •  recognition of overseas deferred tax assets 
 
in addition to requesting that the 
external auditor focus on these areas 
and report to the committee with their 
findings the committee also undertook 
the following actions:
 •  the committee reviewed and challenged 
management’s assumptions supporting the 
valuation and presentation of the ltip charge
 •  the committee reviewed the substance of the 
hbi transaction and the presentation of the 
resultant gain
 •  the committee considered the structure of 
the share placing and reviewed management’s 
accounting
 •  members of the committee with relevant and 
current expertise in property valuations met with 
valuers of the group property portfolio to discuss 
the valuations
 •  reviewed the underlying assumptions in the 
going concern forecasts and the reasonableness 
of the stress tests carried out in relation to those 
forecasts
 •  considered the supporting evidence for 
recognition of overseas deferred tax assets.every third 
year the external audit partner will meet with the 
committee chairman and finance director to formally 
discuss the quality of the external audit process using 
this evaluation framework and the outcome of those 
discussions will feed into the audit process for the 
subsequent three years.the committee meets as considered necessary 
with the external auditor without management being 
present.the 
committee is aware of the emerging requirements for 
listed companies regarding mandatory tendering every 
ten years and has established a tendering policy based 
on these requirements which will apply to the  nancial 
year ending 31 december 2015. 
internal controls and risk management
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the most signi cant risks faced by the 
group has been in place throughout the year and 
up to the date of approval of the annual report and 
accounts.during the course of its reviews of the system of 
internal controls, the board has not identi ed nor been 
advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be signi cant.in particular it is responsible for:
 •  reviewing the structure, size and composition of 
the board and making recommendations to the 
board with regard to any changes required;
 • succession planning for directors;
 •  identifying and nominating, for board approval, 
candidates to  ll board vacancies as and when 
they arise;
 •  reviewing annually the time commitment 
required of non-executive directors; and
 •  making recommendations to the board regarding 
membership of the audit and remuneration 
committees in consultation with the chairman of 
each committee.annual performance related bonus scheme
to reward excellent  nancial performance and achievement of strategic, 
 nancial and operational objectives linked to investor expectations at the 
beginning of the year.
