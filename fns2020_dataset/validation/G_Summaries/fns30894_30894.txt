responsibilities of directors
as explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on pages 64 and 65, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the 
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.where there is a change of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial 
statements include the results for the part of the reporting year during which communisis plc has control.depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
freehold property 25 to 50 years 
long leasehold property 25 to 50 years
short leasehold property 5 to 20 years
plant, equipment and motor vehicles 3 to 20 years
the carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) and an operation within that unit 
(or group of units) is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the 
operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.intangible assets created 
within the business are not capitalised (unless the specific conditions in ias 38 are met) and expenditure is charged to the income 
statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.where the project outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only 
to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable.in the year ended 31 december 2016 an adjustment of £139,000 was made in respect of actual compensation for loss of office charged

• revenue growth rates;
• product and services mix and profit margins; and
• growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.no options were granted under the sharesave scheme in 2017.
the weighted average fair value of the options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing 
model.the following table illustrates the number and waep of, and movements in, share options during the year.the funding position and the divergence of invested assets is under regular review.the carrying amount of these assets approximates to 
their fair value.in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset.subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or a liability will 
be recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit and loss or in other comprehensive income.financial statements
