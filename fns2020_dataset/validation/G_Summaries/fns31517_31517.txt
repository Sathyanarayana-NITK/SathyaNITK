setting the highest standards 
in client service and facilities
dignity is a collection of the ﬁnest
funeral directors throughout the
uk, with over 800 funeral locations
dedicated to serving their local
communities with expertise and
uncompromising compassion.the retention of aﬃnity partners who sell the
group’s pre-arranged funeral plans is essential to
the long-term development of the pre-arranged
funeral plan division.this team is responsible for the
integration of new staﬀ and the
development and welfare of people
across the business.this is regarded as vital to the maintenance of
the group’s system of internal financial control.areas that have been discussed and considered by the
committee in relation to the 2017 annual report are:
• trade names – we examined the judgement made that the
useful life was no longer indeﬁnite and the estimate that a 
35 year life should be ascribed, ensuring that the assessments
made, and conclusions reached, were consistent with the audit
committee’s collective understanding of the funeral business.the
formal annual review was completed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2018.
this review took the form of a detailed questionnaire that was
sent to all committee members and attendees at the committee
meetings.policy on non-audit fees
the group has a rigorous and comprehensive policy on the use
of the external auditors for non-audit work.the policy also precludes the use of the external auditors for
certain types of work.the audit committee has also kept under review the
independence of ey and has been satisﬁed at all times that 
any threats arising to their independence have been subject 
to appropriate safeguards.i am also pleased to advise that mary has taken
over the chairmanship of the remuneration committee from
alan mcwalter following his retirement from the board.overview of remuneration policy
the objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each executive director that will:
• align rewards with the interests of shareholders;
• motivate and encourage superior performance;
• allow the group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy; 
• enable the group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management; and
• ensure that the overall package for each director is linked to strategic objectives of the group.4. the committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider group when setting the remuneration policy for executive directors.the committee considers the performance of the
executive directors as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and share awards to the board for 
final approval.in addition to advice provided to the committee nbs provides some associated advice, for example, in
relation to legal implementation and non-executive director fees.we have audited the ﬁnancial statements of dignity plc which comprise:
the ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements is applicable 
law and international financial reporting standards (ifrss) as adopted by the european union.to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.we obtained supporting evidence for each of
those journals identiﬁed and veriﬁed the journals to originating
documentation to conﬁrm that the entries were valid; and
• we have performed audit procedures in respect of each of the estimates
listed to identity evidence of management bias.• we calculated the degree to which the key inputs and assumptions 
would need to ﬂuctuate before an impairment was triggered and
considered the likelihood of this occurring.the estimate was updated in 2017 to a useful life of 35 years, applicable from 1 october 2017. this resulted in an amortisation
charge of £1.1 million in the period.property, plant and equipment
assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017  | 91
