company financial statements the directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies in accordance with ias 8 ‘accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ and then apply 
them consistently;
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that is relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable;
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in ifrs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group’s and the company’s financial position and financial performance of the 
group and of the company;
 — state that the group and the company have complied with ifrs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.risk our response to the risk

refer to accounting policies (page 41); 
and note 9 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 50)
the risk relates to the assessment of the 
carrying value of exploration assets not being 
performed appropriately, including write-
offs not booked, assets not transferred to 
development, and/or receipt of exploitation 
authorisation or exploration licence 
extensions not occurring in a timely manner.in assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the five reporting components of the group, we selected five components covering entities 
within africa and the uk, which represent the principal business units within the group.the group does not have revenue-generating activities, 
so until these commence there is no impact on the group of the implementation of ifrs 15 and the directors will 
continue to assess the application.the group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.a provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.the etinde asset is 
considered to be a single cash-generating unit and includes historic exploration costs incurred on the etinde permit in line with the treatment of 
those costs for cost recovery purposes.the recoverable amount of the bomono asset calculated on the basis detailed above in 2016 was $36.6m 
(2015 $97.6m).as a result of the current year update following the impairment provision of the bomono 
intangible asset (note 9) and the dividend of $15m of etinde deferred consideration distributed to the company, a further impairment provision of 
$58.1m has been required in relation to the investment in bowleven resources limited (2016: $60.5m).the principal activities of bowleven (kenya) limited and bowleven 
(zambia) limited were to procure and analyse scientific and technical data in order to assess exploration and development potential for oil and gas production in kenya and 
zambia respectively.during the year, the ebt purchased 9,201,577 shares (2016: 3,544,633 shares) and issued 
4,864,909 shares (2016: 3,378,515).the weighted average fair value of approved options granted during the year was £0.06 (2016: £0.06).the weighted average fair value of 
unapproved options granted during the year was £0.06 (2016: £0.06).the awards under the plan during the year are as follows:

outstanding at 1 july 2016 –
granted during the year 10,000,000
expired during the year –
vested during the year –
outstanding at 30 june 2017 10,000,000
the fair value of the btip scheme awards has been calculated using an appropriate suite of models.
