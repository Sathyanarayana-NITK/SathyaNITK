there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new directors to the board.papers for board and 
committee meetings are provided to 
directors in advance of the meeting.no individual 
or group of individuals dominates the 
board’s decision making and the code 
requirement stating that at least half of the 
board (excluding the chairman) should 
comprise independent non-executive 
directors is satisfied.all respondents to the 2017 evaluation 
agreed that the conduct of board 
meetings allows for an open and 
constructuve communication style 
and that the appointment of new 
non-executive directors would continue 
to expand the breadth of market 
and sector experience to the benefit 
of the company.as part of its ongoing assessment of 
senior leadership depth, the committee 
and the board continue to work towards 
developing a diverse internal pipeline 
for future succession to the board and 
senior management.meetings
the nomination committee met three 
times during the year under review and has 
met once in 2018 to the date of this report.it considers a 
number of areas in relation to the external 
auditor: their performance in discharging 
the audit and interim review of financial 
statements, their independence and 
objectivity, and their re-appointment 
and remuneration.as part of this review, the committee 
examined in particular:
• a report from the external auditor 
describing its arrangements to identify, 
report and manage any conflicts of 
interest; and
• the extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor.in accordance with 
the revised ethical standard issued by 
the frc in june 2016, the lead audit 
engagement partner is required to notify 
the audit committee chairman in advance 
for pre-approval of any proposed non-audit 
services.against that background, the committee 
is striving to respond to the increasing 
requests for transparency on the breadth 
and depth of our disclosures and we 
believe this remuneration report 
achieves that goal.50 per cent of award:
