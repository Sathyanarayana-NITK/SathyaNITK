our low cost of finance supports our  
financial performance and we have  
had success in reducing it.we have a disciplined approach  
to capital allocation and retain the flexibility  
to respond to the changing environment.we have engaged more actively  
with the users of our space, and this year, 
launched the ‘office agenda’ an online  
platform where we share key insights with 
workers and decision makers on topical issues 
including the role of real estate in attracting  
and retaining talent and ‘smart’ offices.the next phase of development will see the  
mix of uses continue to evolve.at regent’s place 
we are pleased that we are under offer on 
310,000 sq ft representing all of the office  
space at our proposed redevelopment of  
1 triton square, and received approval from  
the london borough of camden last week.epra net asset value per share (nav) decreased by 0.4% reflecting a 
portfolio valuation fall of 1.4% on a proportionally consolidated basis.debt finance
the scale of our business combined with the 
quality of our assets and rental income means 
that we are able to approach a diverse range of  
debt providers to arrange finance on attractive 
terms.we aim to avoid reliance on particular sources  
of funds and borrow from a large number of lenders from different sectors in the market across a range of geographical areas, 
with a total of 30 debt providers in bank facilities and private placements alone.we remain mindful of potential 
headwinds going forward and our risk appetite 
and tactical decisions will reflect the evolving 
environment to ensure the business remains 
both resilient and well positioned to capture 
upside in the future.aubrey’s considerable 
experience in the property sector is an important part of the mix of skills and 
knowledge on our board.meetings to review and document the 
key considerations undertaken to ensure that information presented is 
fair, balanced and understandable are held between the chief financial 
officer, head of investor relations and the group financial controller 
and other appropriate employees.british land’s approach to risk, including the roles of the board, the 
audit committee and the executive risk committee in setting risk 
appetite and monitoring risk exposure, is detailed in the “managing  
risk in delivering our strategy” section on pages 46 to 49 (c.2.1) .the committee agreed with this conclusion.the valuers attended the committee meetings which considered the  
half year and annual results, and presented their reports including 
providing confirmation of the valuation process, market conditions  
and significant judgements made.aubrey’s considerable expertise in the property sector is an important 
part of the mix of skills and experience on our board.the committee leads the process 
for board appointments
role and responsibilities
the committee’s role and responsibilities are set out in  
its terms of reference found on the company’s website at  
ww w.britishland.com/committees (b.2.1) .detailed consideration was given to each non-executive director’s 
contribution to the board and its committees, together with the overall 
balance of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity on the board.the three measures that will no longer apply are 
adequately covered by the remaining measures in the annual incentive 
plan and ltip.in the 2016 annual report, we disclosed that the tpr element of the 2013 ltip award was expected to vest at 69% while

auditor and disclosure of information 
each of the directors at the date of approval of this report confirms that: 
 – so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
that has not been brought to the attention of the auditor and 
 – the director has taken all reasonable steps to make himself/ 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish  
such information was provided to the auditor
pwc has indicated its willingness to remain in office and, on the 
recommendation of the audit committee, a resolution to reappoint  
pwc as the company’s auditor will be proposed at the 2017 agm.the significance of the estimates and judgements involved, coupled  
with the fact that only a small percentage difference in individual  
property valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material 
misstatement, warrants specific audit focus in this area.the obligations of the reit regime include requirements to comply  
with balance of business, dividend and income cover tests.under the listing rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and the directors’ statement in relation 
to the longer-term viability of the group.john gildersleeve     lucinda bell

consolidated statement of changes in equity
for the year ended 31 march 2017 restatement
the ifrs diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 march 2016 
has been restated to reflect the full dilutive impact of the 1.5% 2012 
convertible bond.the best estimate of employer 
contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 march 2018 is £5m.the scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets (equities and diversified growth funds) which, although expected to outperform 
corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.inflation risk
the majority of the scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases,  
caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation).the table below shows the carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.the company has taken advantage of the following disclosure 
exemptions under frs 101:
(a) the requirements of ias 1 to provide a balance sheet at the  
beginning of the period in the event of a prior period adjustment;
(b) the requirements of ias 1 to provide a statement of cash flows  
for the period; 
(c) the requirements of ias 1 to provide a statement of compliance  
with ifrs;
(d) the requirements of ias 1 to disclose information on the  
management of capital;
(e) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of ias 8 accounting  
policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors to disclose  
new ifrss that have been issued but are not yet effective; 
(f) the requirements in ias 24 related party disclosures to  
disclose related party transactions entered into between two  
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which  
is a party to the transaction is wholly-owned by such a member; 
(g) the requirements of paragraph 17 of ias 24 related party  
disclosures to disclose key management personnel compensation;
(h) the requirements of ifrs 7 to disclose financial instruments; and
(i) the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of ifrs 13 fair value 
measurement to disclose information of fair value valuation 
techniques and inputs.
