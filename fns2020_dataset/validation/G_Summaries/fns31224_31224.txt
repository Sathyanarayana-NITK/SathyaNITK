gan is one of those very few 
companies, and the company’s technical 
systems, operational know-how and proven 
track record of excellence represent a 
substantial competitive barrier to entry 
together with the company’s strategic us 
patent governing the all-important linkage 
of an internet gaming account with an 
on-property rewards account.the group has continued to rationalise its 
cost base through the opening of a new 
technical development office in bulgaria.net revenue for the year of £9.1m has increased 
by 17% and is £1.3m higher than the net revenue 
generated in the previous year of £7.8m.all of the organisations above have different 
requirements and regulations and the group 
is proud that we exceed these in all areas of 
responsible gaming.the remuneration committee reviews the 
performance of the executive director and 
sets and reviews the scale and structure of his 
remuneration.the 
nomination committee comprises michael 
smurfit jr., seamus mcgill and roger kendrick 
and is chaired by michael smurfit jr.
internal control
the group has adopted a share dealing code 
in conformity with the requirements of rule 
21 of the aim rules and esm rules and will 
take steps to ensure compliance by the board 
and the group’s employees with the terms of 
the code.in the opinion of the directors, continuity of investment in  
this area is essential to strengthen the group’s market position and for future growth.under company law  
the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that  
they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the group and company and  
of the profit or loss of the group for that 
period.the maintenance and integrity  
of the group’s website is the responsibility  
of the directors.the directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein.we reviewed a sample of key contracts entered 
into during the year to assess whether the 
revenue had been recognised in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policy, and to 
assess the critical estimates and judgements, 
in particular in respect of the allocation of 
revenue between performance objectives, 
and whether any other terms within the 
contract had any material accounting or 
disclosure implications.the directors’ disclosures in respect to  
going concern are set out in note 2.
our response
the forecasts have been prepared on two 
bases, one being that there is a further equity 
fund-raise in the forecast period and one 
excluding any further fund-raising.in setting the level of 
performance materiality we considered  
a number of factors including the expected 
total value of known and likely misstatements 
(based on past experience and other factors) 
and management’s attitude towards proposed 
adjustments.we have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
companies act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.responsibilities of directors
as explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 28, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, 
and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to  
fraud or error.the consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (the group) as if they formed a single entity.all assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate  
ruling at the reporting date.on disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.financial statements  |  governance  |  strategic report

2.6 intangible assets
externally acquired intangible assets
externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their useful 
economic lives.the amortisation expense is included within the distribution cost line in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.financial statements  |  governance  |  strategic report

3.1 financial risk factors
the group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity and cash  
and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.financing decisions are made by the board of directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and operating expenditure 
required to meet the group’s commitments and development plans.further details of the group’s accounting policy in relation 
to impairment are disclosed in note 2.8. 
the application of the policy requires the use of accounting estimates and judgements in determining the recoverable amount of cash-generating 
units to which the intangible assets are associated.year ended 31 december 2017

the accounting policies of the reportable segments follow the same policies as described in note 2. segment result represents the gross profit 
earned by each segment without allocation of the share of administration costs including directors’ salaries, finance costs and income tax expense.of the trade and other receivables financial instruments as at 31 december 2017, the group does not have a concentration of credit 
risk exposure to a single counterparty (2016: £nil).the directors do not believe there is any equity component of the convertible loan notes as the interest rate reflects the fair value of the debt 
and therefore the loan note is treated as a liability.financing decisions are made by the board of directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and operating 
expenditure required to meet the group’s commitments and development plans.the carrying amount of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities and details of the exposure  
at 31 december 2016 and 2017 are shown in notes 12, 13 and 14.
at each year end, if the united states dollar, euro and australian dollar had weakened by 10% and by 20% against the uk pound sterling 
with all other variables held constant, post tax loss for the year would have (increased)/decreased by:

interest rate risk is at an acceptable level.
