at the company’s expense and to the advice and services of  
the company secretary who advises the board on corporate  
governance matters.the company secretary ensures that board  
procedures are followed and that the company and the board  
operate within applicable legislation.the group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
designed to :
• safeguard assets against unauthorised use or disposition;
• ensure the maintenance of proper accounting records;
• provide reliable information;
• identify and, as far as possible, mitigate potential impediments  
to the group achieving its objectives; and
• ensure compliance with relevant legislation, rules and regulations.further

during 2014 no individual was present when his or her own 
remuneration was being determined.in addition, under the company’s credit facilities and private 
placement notes, the lending banks or holders may require repayment 
of outstanding amounts within 30 and 52 days respectively, of any 
change of control.the fair value of the market-based element of the long-
term incentive plans is calculated using the monte carlo model and is 
dependent on factors including the expected volatility, vesting period 
and risk-free interest rate.the accrued benefits in respect of the former executive directors remain within the scheme and are now paid 
directly by the group.at 31 december 2014, the fair value of interest rate swaps was an asset of  
£15.0 million (2013: £2.0 million asset).the data  
is for the period to the first tenant break option.5. the percentage by which the erv exceeds, or falls short of, rents passing together with the estimated rental value of vacant space, all at 31 december.• scheme members affected by the uk annual allowance may 
choose to limit their benefit and receive a salary supplement 
of the actuarially assessed balance, which is paid shortly after 
the end of the relevant tax year.• in undertaking reviews, the committee will take into account 
factors including market conditions and the level of salary 
increases awarded to other employees of the group, and a 
comparison against both a relevant property peer group and 
a market cap group as selected by the committee (currently 
the largest reits and an appropriate pan-sector group of 
companies with a comparable market capitalisation).approach to remuneration policy
the overall objective of the remuneration committee (committee) 
is to determine an appropriate remuneration policy for 
recommendation to the board that ensures that the company can 
continue to attract, retain and motivate quality leaders who are 
capable of making a major contribution to the company’s success 
whilst avoiding paying more than the committee considers necessary.the limits will not lead to pressure on reward levels 
and the committee is satisfied that it has adopted a suitably 
conservative approach to date and will continue to do so.in addition to the benefits outlined:
• where executive directors are relocated to work in a different country 
the company may (i) pay global relocation support (up to a maximum of 
£400,000); and/or (ii) provide tax equalisation arrangements in relation to 
all elements of remuneration.• the performance measures may consist of a combination of financial  
and non-financial measures.• the committee retains the discretion to amend the performance measures 
and/or conditions used, and/or the weighting of each for future awards and/
or the performance measurement periods.• while the committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the 
normal sense, executive directors can participate in corporate hospitality 
(including travel and where appropriate, with a family member), whether 
paid for by the company or another, within its agreed policies.notes

1. the committee considers the performance measures currently applied to the aip and ltip to be appropriate measures of performance.it recognises the need to balance 
the enhancement of the portfolio (including increasing net rental income) and the efficient management of capital and, over the longer term, should be aligned to the 
interests of shareholders.in accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the committee did not consult with employees in preparing the policy or the 
implementation thereof.the level of additional fees is 
set to reflect the responsibilities of the role.
