route to long-term success
our vision is to give financial institutions and their customers confidence in their data 
and certainty in their transaction processing.measuring our progress
financial
 build a high-margin, 
recurring revenue 
stream based on 
term licence sales, 
subscriptions and 
cloud services.our gross margin continues to be affected by the split of contracting service revenues that are provided by third party contractors (which is recorded 
in cost of sales) and individuals we bring on our payroll as fixed-term employees (which is recorded in administration costs).ken has over 35 years’ experience 
in the it industry and possesses a wealth of knowledge of financial 
technology products and services, having held a number of senior 
executive positions in this sector.in addition, steps are 
continuing to be taken to further embed internal control and risk 
management processes into the operations of the business and to 
deal with areas of improvement which come to management’s and 
the board’s attention.appointments are for three-year terms, which may be renewed by 
mutual agreement, subject always to termination by either party at 
any time on three months’ notice.the exercise of these share options is 
also subject to a performance condition requiring the number of direct 
ctc customers at the date of exercise to be equal to or greater than 40. 
this condition was achieved during 2017 , as determined by the 
remuneration committee.unless any such proposals are approved 
by shareholders in general meeting, there will be no significant changes 
in the way the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2018 compared 
to how it was implemented for the reported year.to the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the parent company and the parent company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.independent auditor’s report gresham technologies plc

key audit matters continued
development costs (note 2, note 13)
description
as detailed in the accounting policies, development 
costs are recognised as an intangible asset if specific 
criteria have been met.in respect of enhancements released to the market during the year, we inspected evidence 
of when the development projects were first available for sale by reference to communication 
with customers and prospective customers, board minutes and market announcements.management’s 
review found no evidence of impairment in the 
clareti or other cash generating units, nor indicators 
of impairment in relation to development costs.for the licence element of new contracts, particularly those in close proximity to the year 
end, we obtained evidence that the software had been delivered to the customer prior to 
the end of the financial year.we agreed a sample of sales and, where relevant, underlying time costs to supporting 
contracts and other documentation, including user acceptance evidence, statements 
of works and time records.our group planning materiality for the financial statements, for both 
the current and prior years, has been based upon 1% of anticipated 
consolidated revenue.an overview of the scope of our audit
the group audit team, based in the uk, performed full scope audits 
of the key reporting components in the uk and north america, comprising 
63% of revenues and 75% of profit before tax.detailed instructions were issued and discussed with the 
component auditors, and these covered the significant risks (including 
the group risks of material misstatement described above) that should 
be addressed by the audit team.the group’s financial statements have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, and derivative financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value.judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date 
and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.after initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other 
than freehold land, on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life 
as follows:
 • fixtures and fittings – over the term of the underlying property lease.the group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this 
designation at each financial year end.financial assets are 
classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term.at each statement of financial position date before vesting, the cumulative 
expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or 
otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument 
subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above.to calculate this, cashflow projections are based 
on financial budgets approved by the board for 2018, which are extrapolated for five years, and extended beyond five years, which the board 
considers appropriate given the long-term opportunities that exists in the asia pacific, emea and north american regions.gresham technologies plc

sensitivity to changes in assumptions
a change in our key assumption in respect to operating cashflows could cause the carrying value of the goodwill or development costs to exceed 
the recoverable amount, resulting in an impairment charge.gresham technologies plc

capital risk
the group defines its capital as the group’s total equity and manages capital based on the level of net cash held.the exercise price per ordinary share is determined by the remuneration committee but will not be less than 110% of the middle market price for 
the dealing day immediately preceding the date of grant of the relevant option.these awards will vest subject to the following conditions:
 • the related bonus shares being retained for a specified period; 
 • any relevant performance targets being met; and
 • the participant remaining in employment with the gresham group until the end of the specified retention period.25. capital commitments
