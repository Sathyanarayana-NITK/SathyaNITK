the audit committee 
and the board review the group’s risk register.the principal risks and uncertainties of the business and how they are managed are 
set out in the table below.13 easyhotel plc annual report and accounts 2017 the board is committed to effective corporate 
governance as the basis for delivering long-term 
value growth and is meeting shareholder 
expectations for proper leadership and oversight 
of the business.not all of the 
provisions of the uk corporate governance 
code are appropriate to easyhotel and 
accordingly the company does not comply 
fully with the code, electing instead to adopt 
practices that are proportional and reflect the 
company’s culture and circumstances, including 
size, complexity and risk.a key reason for this 
success has been the board’s focus on ensuring 
the company employs the right people and has 
access to the necessary skills and resources to 
deliver its objectives.a more detailed report from 
the audit committee can be found on page 16.
the board has also established a remuneration 
committee to oversee remuneration policy and 
determine the remuneration and benefits of the 
company’s executive directors as well as other 
terms relevant to their appointment.the board has chosen not to establish a 
nomination committee and instead deals with 
such matters, including succession planning 
and reviewing the balance of the board, itself.review of the business
the group is required to set out a fair review 
of the business and future developments of 
the group during the financial year ended 
30 september 2017 and the position of the 
group at the year end.the group’s 
external auditors and executive directors 
attend the committee’s meetings by invitation 
and the committee ensures that the auditors 
also have regular opportunities to speak to the 
committee in the absence of management.the audit committee satisfied itself, 
through discussion of the audit plan and 
financial controls, that these risks were 
adequately addressed.details of the payments made are provided on 
page 19.
in addition, the remuneration committee 
determined that an additional discretionary 
one-off bonus of 33% of basic salary should 
be paid to the chief executive officer and 
chief financial officer in april 2017 in 
recognition of the successful £38m placing in 
october 2016 made at a substantial premium 
to prevailing market rates and also their 
contribution to securing the company’s 
successful bank refinancing at the same time.when reviewing the basis for annual 
bonus awards for 2018, the committee has 
determined that, at this stage in the group’s 
development, an appropriate emphasis for 
the performance measures will be delivery 
of ebitda and pbt targets and measurable 
development growth in both the owned and 
franchised hotel elements of the group’s 
portfolio.as at 30 september 2017 , the interests of the directors in ordinary shares, pursuant to options granted under the easyhotel sharesave plan (detailed

basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (uk) (isas (uk)) and applicable law.the following matter was identified by us as the most significant assessed risk of material misstatement:
revenue recognition – deferral of revenue and change in revenue systems
as noted in the strategic report the group has implemented new revenue management systems in the period and this has involved a change in the 
systems and processes used to record revenue data.however, we used a lower specific materiality of £121,000 which represents 5% of adjusted ebitda for the trading related items included within the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and related balances in the consolidated statement of financial position.the group audit team obtained an understanding of the internal 
control environment related to the financial reporting process and assessed the appropriateness, completeness and accuracy of group journals 
and other adjustments performed on consolidation.the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years 
presented in these accounts, unless otherwise stated.the company has taken up its exemption for filing an individual profit and loss account according to section 408 of the companies act 2006. 
the company’s profit or loss for the financial year has been approved by the directors in accordance with section 414 (of the companies act 2006) 
(total comprehensive income for the year ended 30 september 2017 of £890,203 and total comprehensive income of £1,308,861 for the year ended 
30 september 2016).basis of consolidation
the consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyhotel plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 september 2016 and 2017 .adjusted ebitda
adjusted ebitda is a non-statutory measure that represents earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation adjusted for pre-opening 
costs related to the development of hotels, organisational restructuring costs, share based payments and other non-recurring items.taxation
the current tax is based upon the taxable profit for the period together with adjustments, where necessary, in respect of prior periods.the amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).share capital
financial instruments issued by the group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different 
to the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.there have been no substantial changes in the group and the company’s exposure to financial instrument risks, their objectives, policies and 
processes for managing those risks, or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.• franchising – this division involves the group’s franchised hotel operations, in connection with the licence of the group’s brand name.the cost of the assets will be depreciated once the asset is complete and available for use.share options are 
granted, which vest after 32 months, subject to both the employee remaining employed by easyhotel and the achievement of a variety of performance 
conditions.
