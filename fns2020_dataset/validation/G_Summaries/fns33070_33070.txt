review of year end results
under us law, all statements other than statements of historical fact included
in this review are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within
the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of
the securities exchange act of 1934. certain important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-
looking statements are described under section 9 ‘risk factors’ on pages
23-25 as well as elsewhere in this review.the rationale for this analysis is outlined below
and reconciliations of the non-gaap measures used to uk gaap are included
within the review of results.as part of the fast 
forward programme, the portfolio of companies continues to be scaled back.operating costs
reuters operating costs were £2,486 million in 2003, a reduction of 
£309 million (11%) from 2002. this decrease was driven by savings from 
fast forward and earlier transformation programmes.starting in 2005, reuters will be reporting under the
new ifrs standards, which are not expected to significantly affect the amount
of eps accretion or the impact of margin from the acquisition, but may affect
reuters core eps calculation.for more information, see pages 7 and 89. the key objectives of the treasury function are to ensure sufficient liquidity
exists to meet funding needs and to manage the interest rate and currency risks
arising from reuters group’s operations and its sources of finance.the conversion of net investments in overseas subsidiaries into the group’s
reporting currency of sterling creates translation exposure.instinet group and bridge
trading face competition from securities brokers, trading venues and other
financial service providers, including many that are well-capitalised and
substantially larger than instinet group or bridge trading, as the case may 
be, and have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other
resources.to achieve its strategic objectives, reuters group has acquired, invested in
and/or disposed of, and in the future may seek to acquire, invest in and/or
dispose of various companies and businesses.subject to shareholders’ approval at the annual general meeting
(agm) to be held on 21 april 2005, the final dividend will be paid on 28 april
2005 to members on the register at the close of business on 11 march 2005. details of average number of employees by segment are given on 
page 49.
reuters policy is that selection of employees, including for recruitment, training,
development and promotion, should be determined solely on their skills, abilities
and other requirements which are relevant to the job and in accordance with the
laws in the country concerned.06 authority for company to purchase own shares
at the agm held on 22 april 2004, shareholders renewed the company’s
authority under section 166 of the companies act 1985 to make purchases of
up to 143,254,000 ordinary shares at a price of not more than 5% above their
average middle market quotation in the london stock exchange daily official
list for the five business days prior to the date of purchase.they are set out in the company’s constitutional documents and in the code of
conduct which applies to every reuters employee.the board has determined that these directors
are independent according to the nasdaq and sec definitions.if the target rate is not met by the end of the fifth year,
the options will lapse.as the awards are calculated in sterling and devin wenig’s
salary is denominated in us dollars, the proportion of his salary actually awarded
is impacted by the exchange rate.these adjustments are discussed on page 74 and have
the effect of increasing the group’s profits in each of 2002 and 2003 as stated
under us gaap.an audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the remuneration report.03 net interest receivable/(payable)

and multex investor japan in 2003 was accounted for in accordance with frs
2 ‘accounting for subsidiary undertakings’, which represented a departure
from the requirements of the companies act 1985.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include:
• the financial statements of reuters group plc and its subsidiaries to 
31 december.impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset with 
the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.under us gaap, shares held by esots
are shown as a deduction from shareholders’ equity until share options are
exercised by employees.a. revenue recognition
under uk gaap , revenue from contracts for the outright sale of systems-based
product solutions, which include the sale of fully developed software licences, 
is recognised at the time of client acceptance.under uk gaap, interest on fixed income securities
and on cash balances is recorded below operating activities in the profit and
loss account.under uk gaap , stock compensation expenses are not required to be recorded
in respect of certain joint ventures’ and associates’ stock option plans.under uk gaap , goodwill is amortised on 
a systematic basis, whereas under us gaap, goodwill is not amortised but
written down when an impairment arises.under
us gaap, prior to 1 july 2001, goodwill was amortised over its estimated
useful life consistent with uk gaap .under us gaap, if a saye scheme is offered at a lower price than those
offered previously and participants are able to transfer out of an existing
scheme into the new scheme, variable accounting rules apply.under the articles, the special
rights attaching to the founders share may not be varied or abrogated in any
respect without the prior written consent of the founders share company.for the purposes of this discussion, a ‘us holder’ is any beneficial owner of
ordinary shares or adss that is (i) a citizen or resident for tax purposes of the
us, (ii) a corporation organised under the laws of the us or any us state, 
(iii) an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax without
regard to its source, or (iv) a trust if a court within the us is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.in addition, a us holder is subject to backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on dividends paid in the us on
ordinary shares or adss and disposal proceeds realised from the sale,
exchange, redemption or other disposal of ordinary shares or adss unless 
the us holder is a corporation, provides an irs form w-9 or otherwise
establishes a basis for exemption.under the
agreement, reuters has provided us$34 million (£18 million) in funding to
telerate, which, together with interest, will be applied against the purchase
price upon the closing or repaid through a draw on a letter of credit in the
event the deal acquisition does not proceed.
