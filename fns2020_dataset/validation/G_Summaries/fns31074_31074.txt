at the beginning of the year, but, following the departures of charles swingland and tim corn after the company’s annual general meeting  
in may 2017 , it had risen to 43%.dr jean-jacques garaud and marvin samson have indicated that they do not intend to stand for re-election at the company’s 2018 annual 
general meeting.the remuneration committee also complies with the smaller company requirement that it consist of at least two independent  
non-executive directors which has applied to the company since 1 january 2018.

the notes on pages 96 to 128 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.for the purposes of ifrs 3, the total consideration included  
in the valuation consists of $50 million for shares issued to astrazeneca, $100 million deferred non-contingent consideration and the fair 
value of royalties payable to astrazeneca.the change in the presentation reflects the fact that historically the foreign 
exchange differences were to a large extent driven by movements on foreign cash balances whereas following the astrazeneca collaboration 
agreement the foreign exchange differences also arise from translation of monetary liabilities and as such the change in presentation to ‘other 
gains and losses’ was deemed appropriate.key management personnel
key management personnel during the year included directors (executive and non-executive), the chief commercial officer (to 2 march 2017), 
senior vp of commercial us (from 1 july 2017), the general counsel and chief compliance officer, vp of human resources and the
