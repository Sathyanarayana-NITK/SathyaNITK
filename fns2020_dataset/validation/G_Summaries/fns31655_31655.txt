definition
gross profit percentage is calculated as revenue minus the cost 
of sales and any irrecoverable vat, divided by revenue.property costs increased by 
£1.2m due to an increase in the number of centres we operate, 
as well as a small increase, less than 0.1 per cent, in property 
rates on the back of the rating revaluation in april 2017. employee 
costs also form a significant proportion of administration expenses 
– £21.6m, and in total increased by £1.5m, however on a constant 
centre basis the increase was just over £0.1m, to £17.0m.the largest increase was in respect of new centres, 
where during fy2017 we spent £3.9m (net of landlord contributions) 
compared to £0.6m in the prior year.fy2017 includes all capital 
for the three new centres opened in the year, plus over 60 per 
cent of the expected capital for our new centre in dagenham, 
which opened in early october 2017. as we continued on our 
refurbishment and rebrand programme, this expenditure 
increased marginally year-on-year, by £0.1m, to £3.0m.at the end of fy2016, we were recycling 59 per cent of our 
waste and we set a target of 70 per cent by end of fy2017 – 
we achieved this target in august 2017.
we have also cut the amount of waste we generate by reducing 
the use of straws and napkins and we are working with our 
suppliers to introduce reduced packaging products across 
our business.top bowling score: 178

independent non-executive director 
in june 2016. 
committee membership 
chairman of the audit committee, 
member of the nomination committee 
and of the remuneration committee.as noted on ipo and explained in the 2016 annual report, 
the company does not comply with provision a.3.1 of the code 
which requires that the chairman should, on appointment, meet 
the independence criteria set out in provision b.1.1 of the code.in addition to the strategy day held in june, the board discussed 
and monitored the impact of various specific strategic initiatives 
at its meetings during the year including:
• the development, trial and roll-out of dynamic pricing;
• virtual reality and cashless amusement trials;
• the single diner menu; and
• the ongoing centre refurbishment programme.the induction’s purpose was to give 
ivan an overview of the company, focusing on our culture, 
operations and governance structure.voting at the agm will be conducted by way of a poll and 
the results will be announced through the regulatory news service 
and made available on the company’s website.the 
committee’s primary purpose is to develop and maintain a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for identifying appropriate 
candidates for board appointment and re-appointment and to 
make recommendations to the board.the evaluation indicated that the committee’s 
composition is appropriate, and that the process adopted for the 
appointment of ivan schofield during the year was effective.the board 
has, however, delegated responsibility for review of the risk 
management methodology and effectiveness of internal control 
to the audit committee.the chief financial officer provides regular updates to the 
audit committee on the activities of the internal audit function so 
that the committee can assess its effectiveness, and a member 
of the internal audit team reports to the audit committee at 
least annually.this report has been prepared in accordance with the large and 
medium-sized companies and groups (accounts and reports) 
(amendment) regulations 2013, the ukla listing rules and 
the uk corporate governance code.the report is split into 
three parts:

committee;
• a summary of the directors’ remuneration policy which was put 
to a binding shareholder vote at the agm on 23 february 2017 
and will apply for three years from the date of approval.as set out in the table below, based on the group’s excellent adjusted ebitda performance over the year, the remuneration committee 
determined that the executive directors should be awarded 100 per cent of the maximum opportunity under the annual bonus plan.the remuneration committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent.significant interests

71 annual report and accounts 2017 employee involvement and policy regarding 
disabled persons 
the company actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation and places emphasis on keeping its employees 
informed of the group’s activities and financial performance 
by such means as employee briefings and publication (via the 
group’s intranet) to all staff of relevant information and corporate 
announcements.under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period.these matters were addressed, and our results are 
based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for 
the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are 
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.our procedures included: 
• historical comparisons: we assessed the reasonableness 
of the budgets by considering the historical accuracy of the 
previous forecasts;
• evaluating assumptions: we compared the group’s 
assumptions to externally derived and historical data, as well 
as our own assessments in relation to key inputs, in particular 
the growth and discount rates; 
• sensitivity analysis: we performed breakeven analysis 
on the key assumptions noted above to assess whether 
a reasonably possible change in these assumptions could 
trigger an impairment charge;
• comparing valuations: we compared the sum of the 
discounted cash flows to the group’s market capitalisation 
to assess the reasonableness of those cash flows; and 
• assessing transparency: we assessed whether the group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation.recoverability of property, 
plant & equipment (‘ppe’)
(£40 million; 2016: £37 million)
refer to page 57 audit 
committee report), page 87 
(accounting policy) and page 97 
(financial disclosures).forecast-based valuation
property, plant and equipment 
are the second most 
quantitatively significant item on 
the group balance sheet, and, 
therefore, an area of our audit 
focus due to its size and the 
nature of the group’s business.the parent company materiality, was therefore lower than the 
materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to 
a benchmark of the parent company net assets, and represents 
0.7% (2016: 0.5%) of this benchmark.annual report and accounts 2017 85

leases
(i) operating leases
leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.impairment 
tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken:
• at the end of the first full financial period following acquisition and at the end of every subsequent financial period; and
• in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be receivable.(ii) impairment of non-financial assets
the carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for impairment when there is an indication that 
the assets might be impaired.an impairment loss is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income immediately.when an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same party on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, 
and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.it also 
requires the directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies which are detailed above.the deferred shares did not confer any right to vote, receive notice of or attend general meetings 
of the company.
