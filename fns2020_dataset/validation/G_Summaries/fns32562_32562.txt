d. bank funding risk
the pressure on a large number 
of traditional real estate lending 
banks to reduce their exposure 
to real estate reduces the 
capacity and liquidity within  
the lending market and can 
impact upon the availability of 
debt to deliver business plans.– the group is constantly 
seeking to widen its range of 
funding sources and liaises 
with new entrants into the real 
estate lending market.− the group continues to be able to source new business opportunities 
capable of delivering both short-term trading gains and longer-term 
development gains to replace existing projects as they are exited.during the year, the launch of specialist platforms with 
colony northstar and proprium capital partners has set 
us well on the way to delivering the fee target and we 
continue to look at ways to drive efficiencies across the 
business, focusing particularly on simplifying our corporate 
structure, reducing the number of corporate entities and 
leveraging our intellectual capital.during the year, the group entered into two new large-scale 
joint ventures (specialist platforms): 
 − a joint venture with colony northstar, targeting  
€300 million of office refurbishment and repositioning 
opportunities in london, manchester and dublin.those findings are 
recorded in any relevant structuring document;
 − the maintenance of good relationships with tax 
authorities and a clear interaction between tax planning 
and the group’s wider corporate reputation and 
responsibility; and  
 − management of tax affairs in a manner that seeks to 
maximise shareholder value whilst operating within the 
parameters of existing tax legislation.during the year, the value of sterling against the euro fell 
significantly, following the eu referendum in june 2016. 
the impact on our nav during the period was a reduction 
of £0.4 million, which is the net result of a loss of £3.4 million 
recorded in finance costs in the profit and loss account 
and a gain through reserves of £3.0 million.i took over from david jenkins as chairman of the board, 
following the agm in july 2016. lynn krige was appointed 
as a new independent non-executive director in march

and risk committee, following the 2016 agm.biographical information for the directors in office at the

regulatory announcements comply with applicable legal 
or regulatory requirements.– to be responsible for leading the non-executive directors in the annual performance evaluation  
of the chairman.the committee reviews the 
key risks of the company, the risk register, and the mitigation 
processes in place.the board’s statement to 
this effect is set out in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities on page 113.
non-audit services
the non-audit services policy was adhered to throughout 
the year, providing additional control measures around the 
instruction of the auditors to undertake non-audit work.the key features of u+i’s system of internal control include:
 − a comprehensive system of financial reporting and 
business planning with appropriate sensitivity analysis;
 − a detailed authorisation process which ensures that no 
material commitments are entered into without 
competent and extensive approval;
 − a defined schedule of matters reserved for the  
board, and clear defined roles of the chairman and 
chief executive;
 − an organisational structure with clearly defined levels 
of authority;
 − formal documentation of procedures;
 − the close involvement of the executive directors  
in all aspects of the day to day operations, including 
regular meetings with senior management to review all 
operational aspects of the business and risk  
management systems;
 − a review of the group strategy and progress on 
developments at each scheduled board meeting;
 − a comprehensive insurance programme; and
 − a formal whistleblowing policy.directors are introduced to 
shareholders at the agm, including the identification of non-executive directors and committee chairs.the committee 
may permit additional holiday 
in lieu of remuneration.86
u and i group plc annual report and accounts 2017 minor changes
the committee may make minor amendments to the policy 
(for example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change  
in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for 
the amendment.− it would be expected that the structure and quantum of 
the variable pay elements would reflect those set out 
in the policy table.the board considers 
the authority sought to be appropriate in order to allow the 
company flexibility to finance business opportunities or 
to conduct a pre-emptive offer or rights issue without the 
need to comply with the strict requirements of the statutory 
pre-emption provisions.accordingly, 
the company wishes to ensure that neither it nor its 
subsidiaries inadvertently commits any breaches of the 
companies act 2006 through the undertaking of routine 
activities, which would not normally be considered to result 
in the making of political donations and political expenditure 
being incurred.the directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the company 
and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply 
with the companies act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.they 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and the group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.area of focus how our audit addressed the area of focus
valuation of investment properties
the group’s investment properties were valued at 
£179.2 million as at 28 february 2017 and a revaluation loss

recoverability of financial assets
the group holds a number of loans with joint ventures, 
associates and other third parties that must be assessed 
for recoverability at each period end.in addition, a number  
of key performance indicators of the group are driven by income statement 
items and we therefore also applied a lower specific materiality for testing 
determinants of profit, excluding the revaluation movements of investment 
properties, gain on disposal of investment properties and net finance costs.in addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group, the company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report.in each case a judgement is required as to the status of 
the group’s interest, as an associate, a joint venture, a joint 
operation or a financial asset, typically focusing on the 
extent of control exercised by the group.in cases where 
the entity is capable of being operated as a business, or 
an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the 
property, the group accounts for the acquisition as a 
business combination.rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated 
between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity 
based on their relative fair values at the acquisition date.these properties are recognised 
initially at cost, which includes the original purchase price 
of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use.furthermore, at 
the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the 
group documents whether the hedging instruments that 
are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged 
items.onerous lease provisions are created for properties that 
are unoccupied, sub-let at below the rent payable on the 
head lease or for operating sites where the projected future 
trading revenue is insufficient to cover the value-in-use.the calculations use pre-tax 
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a period up to the completion 
of each project (or less than five years).
