during fy2017 we have supported their helping hands 
programme which renovates the homes and gardens of sick 
children by providing tools and equipment as well as volunteers.succession planning aims 
to identify talent within the group and is formally 
reviewed on an annual basis by the nomination 
committee, focussing on both short and long-term 
successors for the key roles within the group.speedy’s ability to supply assets with the expected 
customer service is therefore reliant on the 
performance of others with the risk that if this is not 
effectively managed, the reputation of speedy and 
hence future revenues may be adversely impacted.annual and more medium-term planning processes  
are in place; these create future visibility as to the level 
and type of it infrastructure and services required 
to support the business strategy.the impact on the group of any such change 
is assessed as part of the ongoing financial and 
operational budgeting and forecasting process.in view of 
the considerable board and committee changes across the 
previous two years i was pleased that the overall findings were 
positive, supporting my personal assessment.further details of the evaluation are 
provided on page 45 of the governance report.this section of the annual report highlights 
the company’s governance processes, alongside the work of 
the board and board committees.during the year, a full review of governance practices was 
undertaken to ensure our governance structures remain in line 
with developing best practice and are suitable for a company 
of our size.we consider that the code’s principles 
are central to the effective management of the business, to 
maintaining the confidence of our investors and are in the best 
interests of all of our stakeholders.disclosure of information to auditors
the directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s 
auditors are unaware and each director has taken all the 
steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.we consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.we explain in this section how the company has applied the 
principles of good governance and the code of best practice  
set out in the code.the terms 
of reference of the nomination committee are published on 
the company’s website.the remuneration committee 
has appointed nbs to advise it in relation to the design of 
appropriate executive remuneration structures.the terms of reference of the audit 
committee are published on the company’s website.in addition, and where appropriate to do 
so, the audit committee takes account of the external valuation 
reports prepared in connection with the group’s financing 
arrangements.the policy further requires that 
the provision of any non-audit services by the external auditors 
is subject to prior approval by the audit committee.the remuneration committee firmly believes 
that the current overarching remuneration policy continues to be 
effective and that no significant changes are required.this revised directors’ 
remuneration policy will be put to shareholders for approval  
in a binding vote at the agm on 12 july 2017. the effective date 
of the revised policy will be 12 july 2017. the remuneration 
committee’s current intention is that the revised policy will 
operate for the three-year period to the agm in 2020.

the primary objective of the remuneration policy is to promote 
the long-term success of the group.our remuneration structure is intended to be simple and 
transparent, and to contribute to the building of a sustainable 
performance culture.details 
of the current salary levels 
are set out in the annual 
remuneration report 
 > any salary increase (in 
percentage of salary terms) 
will ordinarily be in line 
with the general increase 
for the broader employee 
population; however, a lower 
or a higher increase may be 
awarded to recognise, for 
example, an increase in the 
scale, scope or responsibility 
of the role and/or to take 
account of relevant market 
movements
 > where an executive 
director’s salary is set below 
market levels at appointment, 
a series of increases may 
be given (in addition to 
the factors listed above) in 
order to achieve the desired 
salary positioning, subject 
to satisfactory individual 
performance
 > none, although 
the overall 
performance of 
the individual

overview of the scope of our audit

whole was set at £0.675 million (2016: £0.5 million), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of group 
profit before tax, normalised to exclude exceptional 
items (as disclosed in note 3 to the financial 
statements), of which it represents 4.7% (2016: 
4.5%).based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the strategic report and the directors’ report:
— we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
— in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the companies act 2006.6. we have nothing to report in respect of the matters
on which we are required to report by exception
under isas (uk and ireland) we are required to report to
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our
audit, we have identified other information in the annual
report that contains a material inconsistency with either
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.the group’s interest in the entity is the carrying amount 
of the investment together with any long-term loan balances and interest that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the 
entity.revenue is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the hire.subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with  
the accounting policy applicable to that asset.the minimum rent receivable
