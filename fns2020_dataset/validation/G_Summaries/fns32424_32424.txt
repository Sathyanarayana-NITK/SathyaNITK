elliott has decided to step down from the board at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting.the items to be reviewed are 
agreed by the committee chairman on behalf of his fellow members.committee activities
the work of the committee during the year to 31 march 2017, in addition 
to evaluating the effectiveness of its own performance, fell into three 
main areas:
1. accounting and financial reporting
the committee reviewed the:
a.  annual and interim financial statements;
b.  significant financial reporting policy disclosures and judgements;
c.  the appropriateness of the preparation of the financial statements on 
a going concern basis;
d. long-term viability statement prior to board approval; and 
e.  annual report to consider whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides information relevant to 
shareholders’ assessment of the group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.the internal audit function reports directly to the committee.the year-end

less cost to sell or value-in-use.the committee reviewed the paper prepared by management in support 
of the accounting treatment.the report is split into three main areas:
• the statement by the chairman of the remuneration committee  
set out opposite;
• the annual report; and
• the policy report.a resolution to approve the annual report on remuneration will also be put 
to this year’s annual general meeting to be held on 6 september 2017.
the companies act 2006 requires the auditor to report to the 
shareholders on certain parts of the directors’ remuneration report and to 
state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report to be audited 
have been properly prepared in accordance with schedule 8. the parts of 
the annual report on remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated 
in that report.this led to a new directors’ remuneration policy that was developed by 
the remuneration committee which envisaged the introduction of a long 
term incentive plan (ltip) for certain members of the executive team.36
