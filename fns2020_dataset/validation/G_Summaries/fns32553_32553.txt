pension obligations.board effectiveness

remuneration committee
sabri challah
chairman of the  
remuneration committee
we believe our remuneration policy 
is designed to deliver both annual 
performance as well as the longer term 
transformation of de la rue.composition of the committee
the remuneration committee consists exclusively of non-executive directors, 
all of whom are regarded as independent, and the chairman of the board, who 
was regarded as independent on his appointment as chairman.the page reference for the full detail 
within the proposed policy is also provided.the purchase price is 85% of the lower of the market 
value of a de la rue plc share either at the beginning or end of the offering period.fees payable to a newly-appointed chairman or non-executive director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the 
time of appointment.awards under the psp had three year performance criteria based on earnings per 
share (eps) and return on capital employed (roce).performance measures applying to psp awards to be made in 2017
the remuneration committee has given detailed consideration, following shareholder consultation during 2016, to the potential 
reintroduction of a relative tsr performance measure but concluded that the measures of eps growth and roce are the most 
appropriate measures for de la rue.willis towers watson is a member of the remuneration consultants’ group and has signed up to the code of conduct relating 
to the provision of executive remuneration advice in the uk.the group also maintains directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover for its 
directors and officers.the directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the group’s website.assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the 
group’s disclosures regarding the judgements applied in 
identifying and valuing the acquisition-related intangibles.presentation appropriateness
the group discloses separately 
‘exceptional items’ which the directors 
consider to be items of income or 
expense which are important to identify 
to shareholders to aid their understanding 
of the ‘underlying’ business performance.the 
work on six of the 18 components (2016: six of the 18 
components) was performed by component auditors and the 
rest by the group audit team.the consideration transferred in the 
acquisition is measured at fair value 
as are the identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired.transactions in foreign currencies entered 
into by group entities are translated 
into the functional currencies of those 
entities at the rates of exchange at the 
date of the transaction.revenue is recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated 
with the transaction will flow into the 
group and the amount can be reliably 
measured.however, 
circumstances that the directors believe 
would give rise to exceptional items for 
separate disclosure would include: gains 
or losses on the disposal of businesses 
(other than those within the scope of 
ifrs 5), curtailments on defined benefit 
pension arrangements, restructuring 
of businesses, asset impairments and 
costs associated with the acquisition and 
integration of business combinations.these include the rate used to discount 
future liabilities, the expected longevity 
for current and future pensioners and 
estimates of future rates of inflation.the ageing of trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments) at the reporting date was:

the provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables is used to record losses unless the group is satisfied that no 
recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial 
asset directly.the group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.comprehensive loss after tax was £0.3m comprising a loss of £7.8m of fair value movements on new and continuing cash flow 
hedges, a gain of £0.2m on maturing cash flow hedges for capital expenditure and a £8.0m gain to the income statement to 
match the recognition of the related cash flows in effective cash flow hedge relationships.18 provisions for liabilities and charges
accounting policies
provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation in respect of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount can be reliably estimated.the group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate.discount rate has been determined using the ‘internal rate of return’ for the transaction with an incremental risk premium added 
based on the perceived additional risk for this asset as compared to the acquired business as a whole.
