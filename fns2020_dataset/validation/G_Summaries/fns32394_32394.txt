deferred income
deferred income arises where revenue 
is invoiced ahead of delivery of 
performance obligations and therefore 
recognition of revenue.based on the funding available, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future.the directors have decided to adopt the corporate governance code for small and mid-sized quoted 
companies, as published by the quoted companies alliance, and have sought to meet its recommendations in so far as it 
considers them appropriate for a company of castleton’s size and nature.the board of directors
at the financial year-end the board comprised the non-executive chairman (david payne), the executive deputy chairman (ian 
smith), the chief executive officer (dean dickinson), the chief financial officer (haywood chapman) and one non-executive 
director (phil kelly).the audit committee has formal terms of reference (available on request from the company secretary).these include the 
recommendation, appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditors, the review of the scope and results of 
the interim review and external annual audit by the auditors, their cost effectiveness, independence and objectivity.in addition, the group maintains written processes to control 
expenditure, authorisation limits, purchase ordering, sales order intake, project management, inventories and assets to the extent 
applicable given the changes in the group’s activities during the year.performance related bonus
the remuneration committee determines the criteria for the award of performance bonuses for the executive directors in 
advance of each year.in addition on 29 january 2016, in order to fund the acquisition of kypera, the company issued £3.5 million of unsecured loan 
notes (“kypera loan notes”), which have a term of 5 years and carry interest at a rate of 5% per annum, which is not cash paid.21 castleton technology plc annual report 2017
