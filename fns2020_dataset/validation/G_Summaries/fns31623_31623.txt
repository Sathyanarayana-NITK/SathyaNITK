consequently, the board has restated 
the opening balance sheet as at 1 october 2015 to reflect 
the above.the actuarial movement is accounted for 
through the group statement of comprehensive income.in contracting, management 
is required to estimate the total expected costs on a contract and the stage of contract 
completion in order to determine both the revenue and profit to be recognised in an 
accounting period.the audit 
committee considers the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the risk management and control systems of the group, 
and reports the results to the board.it reviews the scope 
and results of the external audit, its cost effectiveness 
and the objectivity of the auditor.the audit committee 
monitors the non-audit work performed by the auditor 
to help ensure that the independence of the auditor is 
maintained.the group engages, promotes and trains staff on the basis 
of their capabilities, qualifications and experience, without 
discrimination, giving all employees an equal opportunity 
to progress.disclosure of information to the auditor 
the directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
directors’ report confirm the following: 
 • so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the group’s auditor is unaware; and 
 • each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the group’s 
auditor is aware of that information.the auditor is not required to report to the 
shareholders on the directors’ remuneration report.remuneration policy
the company’s remuneration policy is that the remuneration 
packages of the executive directors should be sufficiently 
competitive to attract, retain and motivate those directors to 
achieve the company’s objectives, without making excessive 
payments.the remuneration and employment terms of the 
executive directors are determined by the committee by 
comparison with salaries paid to, and terms agreed with, 
directors in similar companies in the same sector and of a similar 
size and after a review of the performance of the individual.the company’s policy to grant 
options or awards under the above schemes is at the remuneration 
committee’s discretion as and when considered appropriate.the remuneration committee is empowered to grant a 
maximum number of ltip options over 10p ordinary shares 
equivalent in value to 150 per cent of basic salary per financial 
year.remuneration for the year ending 
30 september 2017
service contracts and letters of appointment 
the company’s policy is for all of the executive directors to 
have rolling service contracts that provide for a twelve month 
notice period.accordingly, under the terms of the 
scheme, the executive directors are entitled to receive an 
annual bonus equal to 51.5 per cent of salary.the reduced entitlements have been reflected in the table 
above and show the maximum number of options to which 
j samuel is entitled.for these contracts, where 
possible, we agreed the year-end contract 
balance to the cash recovered post period end 
and/or the third party work certified to date;
 • test of detail: where cash has not been 
received or work has not been certified post 
year end, challenging the directors in respect of 
contract balances in the sample identified, by 
obtaining the detailed project review papers 
from the group to support the estimates made 
and challenged the judgements underlying 
those papers with senior operational, 
commercial and financial management, 
compared to our knowledge of the business;
 • test of detail: assessing the forecasted cost to 
complete in the sample identified by 
considering contract performance and costs 
incurred post year-end along with discussions 
and challenge of the judgements underlying the 
positions taken with senior operational, 
commercial and financial management, 
compared to our knowledge of the business; 
 • h i s t or i ca l c om p a r i s on s : assessing the 
forecasting accuracy of contract margins by 
evaluating initial forecasted margins for a 
sample of contracts across the portfolio against 
actual margins achieved; and
 • assessing transparency: assessing the 
adequacy of the group’s disclosures in respect 
of the accounting policies on long-term 
contracts and judgements and estimates, set 
out in notes 1 and 1(a).2. key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued annual report and accounts 2017 renew holdings plc 43

presentation of consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the international financial reporting standards 
(“ifrss”) as adopted by the eu (“adopted ifrss”).the board has determined that the following areas are those in which estimates and judgements have been made and where 
material impacts could arise in the financial statements were such estimates and judgements to be varied.this arises where the group is the head lessee for a property lease 
contract where the property is not used by the group and where the group has not been able to sublet the property or has 
only been able to do so on terms which are less favourable than those of the head lease.prior year adjustment
in previous years, the group has provided for deferred tax on its pension scheme surplus at the rate of corporation tax expected 
to be prevailing in the future, provided that the relevant legislation had been enacted.the interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement and represents a constant proportion of 
the balance of capital repayments outstanding.all financial assets are recognised whenever the group becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the financial instrument.the amortisation policy is disclosed in the accounting policies and approximates to a period of four years.the degree to which the group is exposed to this risk depends on the individual financial situation of each 
specific customer.the amco scheme investments are independently managed by blackrock asset management who are 
set a target return against which the trustees monitor their performance on a regular basis.the company’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group.in accordance with frs 102 ‘the financial reporting standard’, deferred tax is not provided on permanent timing differences.the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted.the 
fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.the expected volatility has been calculated based on weekly historical volatility of the company’s share price over the 
three years prior to the date of grant.the risk free rate of return has been based on the yields available on three year 
uk government bonds as at the date of grant.
