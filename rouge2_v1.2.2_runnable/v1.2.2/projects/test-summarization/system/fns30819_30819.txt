our vision
to provide exceptional service to our consumers 
and customers by being outstanding at everything 
we do. the knock-on effect of this is that 
consumers can find it challenging to identify the best provider 
for their legal concern from amongst the many choices open to 
them in the market. in order to support consumers in making the right choice, we 
firmly believe there is a need for greater clarity and guidance and 
for the legal sector to identify trusted, knowledgeable partners 
to work with. the speed of the development of the sector and 
the myriad ways that consumers can access this help is 
increasing. our mission
to become the leading provider in our 
chosen consumer legal services markets by:
 ¡ creating trusted brands that enable consumers to 
access the law;
 ¡ forging strategic customer partnerships that create 
mutual value; and
 ¡ embracing developing technologies to reach and 
interact with our consumers and customers. key milestones since flotation

of personal injury division. ¡ revenue up 2.5% to £51.9m (2016: £50.6m). ¡ as expected, underlying operating profit 
down 19.4% to £14.5m (2016: £18.0m). ¡ profit before tax of £12.4m (2016: 15.8m). ¡ establishment and operational launch of two 
alternative business structure (abs) 
ventures with early signs encouraging. ¡ critical care division ahead of last year with 
continued growth in market share. ¡ solid trading performance from residential 
property division against a challenging 
market backdrop. we are focused on personal injury,  
(the largest of the cls segments),  
critical care and residential property. may 2014
floated nahl group plc on aim
investing in our future, increasing 
our profile and status, signalling our 
intention towards future growth. however, we anticipate a 
softening in the overall market as a result of a reduction in road 
traffic accident (rta) claims caused by the cumulative impact 
of prior legislative change which has resulted in demand 
uncertainty. there has been an apparent decline in employer liability cases 
but this is attributed to a significant reduction in noise induced 
hearing loss (nihl) cases rather than an overall reduction in 
these claims. nah has deliberately not been active in the volume 
nihl market due to concerns about the nature of some claims 
and so its value to panel law firms (plfs). we discovered that our consumers often feel that 
they have been wronged by their injury – it may 
have caused them to suffer long lasting effects 
meaning that their quality of life is changed, or they 
may have lost earnings through being unable to 
work. i 
love riding my motorbike and doing it up, i do a lot of 
my own mechanics. i was riding my motorbike when a 
van suddenly pulled across in front of me. i had no 
chance of avoiding him or to stop, and i hit the side of 
it. critical care 
bush & company rehabilitation 
(bush)
market leading provider of case managers 
and expert witnesses to solicitors and 
insurance companies in support of serious 
and catastrophic injury victims. the war for talent is an ongoing and  important dynamic so 
continuing our focus on quality and supporting our consultant base 
remains a key priority and during the year we have increased the 
number of case managers working with bush. we are also sensing a greater focus on a more strategic approach by 
firms who are adopting a procurement based model. act and deliver
consumers are then matched with an expert who is 
most appropriate to serve their needs, be they as legal 
firm, surveyor, expert witness or case manager. there has been a 
marked increase in claims categorised as “other” and this is 
driven by a spike in foreign, gastric illness claims which is an area 
that nah is not engaged with. being curious about how we could be at 
the forefront of this, nah created its own abss. nah has actively lobbied government to ban this intrusive 
and damaging practice. the legal support advisors at nah are experts  
in sensitively accompanying consumers through the 
complex and sometimes daunting process of making a 
claim.
