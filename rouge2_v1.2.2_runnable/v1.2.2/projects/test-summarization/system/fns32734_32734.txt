on human life and bespoke annuities. during this career, he has been responsible for over 20 private 
equity investments with transactional values in excess of $1bn. errors or breaches may occur resulting in the invocation of praxisifm’s contractual protections 
and potentially give rise to a claim against the group. basis of consolidation
the group’s consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries and 
associated undertakings drawn up to 30 april each year. the mechanisms and approach taken comply with the 
finance sector code of corporate governance issued by 
the guernsey financial service commission and have been 
developed with uk corporate governance code in mind. regulators
the group operates within complex regulatory 
environments in each of its jurisdictions. we aim to ensure 
we meet or exceed those regulatory requirements. we deal with our regulators in an open manner and have a 
constructive dialogue with them as required. the group has integrated several acquisitions over the 
last few years and continues to grow via a combination of 
organic growth and value-accretive acquisitions that help to 
diversify its jurisdictional reach and service offerings. this ensures 
alignment of interest with external shareholders. the board 
actively seeks to widen share ownership amongst employees 
through share option and buy-as-you-earn schemes. the group has fully expensed significant amounts of short 
term and one off costs associated with its listing and its 
recent acquisitions. we have restructured the governance regime and we were 
delighted to appoint two experienced non executives, 
andrew haining as non-executive chairman and iain stokes 
as non-executive director and chair of the audit committee. iain was previously group managing director at 
mourant international fund administration (‘mifa’) where 
he was part of the executive team that managed the sale of 
mifa to state street. attendance at the agm 
is encouraged and all questions are welcomed. shareholders 
are also able to contact the company directly through  
the company secretary (julia.wilkes@praxisifm.com) or in 
writing with correspondence addressed to the company 
secretary. board composition
the board is made up of two non executive directors and 
the chief executive officer. the executive directors who previously sat on the group 
board now sit on the management committee. 2017 annual report & accounts annual report for the year ended 30 april 2017
