vision, robust values and great people. the company’s success is driven by a strong portfolio of market 
leading brands including cathedral city cheese, clover dairy 
spread, country life butter and frylight, the original one calorie 
cooking spray. this brings exciting new opportunities  
in the high growth global infant formula market. we strive constantly to innovate, bringing new products to market 
and introducing new ways of working across the business. our 
world-class supply chain starts with milk supplied by 360 farmers in 
the dairying heartlands of cornwall and devon. this top quality milk 
is made into cheddar cheese at our highly-automated creamery 
in davidstow, cornwall. whey is a by-product of the cheese making process. highlights

mh foods. nothing in this annual 
report and accounts should be construed as a profit forecast. cost reduction projects initiated in the year ended 
31 march 2017 have delivered substantial benefits 
ahead of plan. achieve revenue targets for products developed in the last  
3 years. *  roce is calculated as product group profit from continuing operations for the year divided 
by the average operating assets of the continuing operations over the year. grow our four key brands ahead of the market. in the first half of the year, milk volumes were strong across 
the uk and falling milk and cream prices reflected this. however, 
after two years of pronounced deflation, uk and global dairy 
markets strengthened in the second half of the year as supply fell. in this environment, we increased the price we pay our farmers for 
milk by 38% between the summer of 2016 and march 2017. the 
impact on cream prices was even more pronounced and butter 
input costs doubled in the second half of 2016.
despite this background, we increased profits and delivered 
a strong branded performance, especially across our butters, 
spreads and oils portfolio. operational performance – pages 18 to 21
