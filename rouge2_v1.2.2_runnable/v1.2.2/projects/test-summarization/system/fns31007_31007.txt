operational highlights strategic report | our strategy
developing our brand
our marketing connects with the strong positive 
emotions that moving home often generates and 
reflects our position at the heart of it. the board increased the interim dividend to 22.0p  
(h1 2016: 19.0p) per ordinary share, which was paid on  
3 november 2017. we are confident in our ability to deliver 
i am pleased to present rightmove plc’s results for the year 
ended 31 december 2017.
throughout our history we have enabled our property 
industry partners to be more informed, make better and faster 
decisions and realise efficiencies both during robust and 
quieter housing market cycles. we have also continued 
to be the only place where consumers can see almost the 
entire uk property market, giving our customers access to an 
unrivalled audience for their brands and exposure for their 
sales and rental properties. nick had led the company as chief 
executive officer since april 2013 and together with his 
management team helped deliver an outstanding financial 
performance with revenues growing by over 50% and a strong 
share price rise during that period that reflected our delivery 
of continued improvements in value provided to customers 
and consumers alike. we bring the uk’s largest and most 
engaged property audience and 
the largest inventory of properties 
together in one place. our customer numbers increased to a 
record high of nearly 20,500, testament 
to our aim to provide customers with 
the most effective marketing exposure 
and the highest quality leads, as well as 
helping to drive efficiencies within their 
businesses through tools and support. page 16
supporting our customers
we provide the most significant and effective 
exposure for customers’ brands and properties. we are the largest source of high quality leads  
and offer value adding products and packages. rightmove’s higher value optimiser product package is a 
perfect example of the changing and improved nature of our 
digital product suite. our aim is to make home moving easier by  
creating a simpler and more efficient property  
market place. as the industry becomes more digital 
our software has become even more 
valuable to our customers with 90% of 
our agency members making use of it 
each month. the quality and clarity of user experience across 
desktop, smartphone and tablet is testament to our 
developers and designers who seek to achieve this outcome. perhaps the most notable 
feature of 2017 was our continued innovation of digital 
solutions for the uk housing market. t he y 	 will 	 be 	 pleased 	 t o 	 deal 	 with 	 an y 	 questions
