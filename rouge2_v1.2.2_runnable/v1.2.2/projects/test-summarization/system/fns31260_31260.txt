our head office is based in mansfield, 
nottinghamshire. • ilm level 3, 5 and blp level 7 accredited 
programmes have been evaluated and 
realigned with business and people 
development needs. further details of the expected 
transition can be found in note 1. these contracts have negatively impacted the 
group’s income statement in 2013 and subsequent years. • the adoption of ifrs15 in next year’s 
annual report is expected to result in 
restated revenue of circa £300m and 
profit and total comprehensive income 
of around £7.2m for 2017, primarily 
due to restricted recognition of variable 
income on legacy contracts in earlier 
years. however, it is disappointing to 
report that the strong growth in both revenue and profitability 
has been significantly impacted upon by the ongoing legacy 
contractual dispute with cyden homes limited and the poor 
second half trading performance of the utilities division. brexit has caused uncertainty around the uk economy in 
general and this has the potential to distort some of our 
markets, including price pressures in our supply chain due 
to the weakening of the pound. what this means for nm group
we expect significant profitable growth during the next 
three years in line with our in-depth strategic business plan 
projections. 25748  5 april 2018 11:24 am  proof 14 25748  5 april 2018 11:24 am  proof 14
