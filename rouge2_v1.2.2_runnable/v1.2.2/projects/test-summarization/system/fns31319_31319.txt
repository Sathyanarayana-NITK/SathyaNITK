communications contains three main 
communication and advisory agencies. 133 million americans currently have at 
least one chronic disease, a number expected to rise to 164 
million in the next 10 years. revenue grew by 9% to £197.0 
million and headline profit before tax by 
52% to £24.4 million. on a like-for-like 
basis, this represents growth of 4% and 
20% respectively. 2  like-for-like revenues are stated at constant exchange rates and excluding the 
effect of acquisitions and disposals. our continued focus on operational 
efficiencies and the elimination of 
loss-making agencies combined with 
strong organic growth from the 
healthcare division produced a very 
strong like-for-like growth in headline 
profit of 20%. currency headwinds are currently anticipated 
into 2018, primarily as a result of the weaker us dollar. increasing pressure on client budgets
pressures on marketing budgets continue to intensify and 
there is increasing pressure to justify spend. despite increasing foreign exchange headwinds, 
the year has started well with good trading momentum and huntsworth is 
well positioned for further growth in 2018.

in our communications division, i am 
pleased to report that grayling has 
responded positively to its restructuring 
and has now returned to profitability, 
with a notably strong performance from 
its uk operation. principal brands
huntsworth health has three main divisions. citigate dewe rogerson is an 
international financial and corporate public relations 
consultancy. buoyant trading in the three healthcare-
focused divisions was again led by 
evoke (within the marketing division) 
and apothecom (in the medical 
division), both of which had outstanding 
years. after three years’ service, tim ryan, the 
group’s senior independent director, 
stepped down from the board in 
december 2017. i would like to thank tim 
for his support and help in guiding the 
group over the critical restructuring 
period from 2014 to 2017. andy boland, 
who is the group’s longest serving 
non-executive director, will become the 
new senior independent director. marketing focuses 
on post-approval marketing of drugs to payers, 
healthcare professionals and consumers, primarily 
in the us. there is real momentum at huntsworth 
as all the agencies focus on what is of 
most value to their clients. as such each of our 
businesses operates in markets with their 
own characteristics and dynamics. biotech products are 
expected to account for 29% of total drug sales by 2022, 
up from 26% in 2017. this creates additional opportunities 
for agencies which are best able to navigate the complex 
regulatory and institutional environment surrounding  
these drugs. immersive provides live experiences, 
communications and interactive content. • vr & instructional design. • interactive. the immersive division, led by the creative 
engagement group, engages audiences 
through the creation and delivery of live 
experiences, film, immersive, interactive, 
training and scientific content. the group’s principal area of focus is 
health, which provides marketing and 
medical communications services to 
healthcare clients, which are primarily  
large and mid-size pharmaceutical and 
biotech companies. it also has a smaller 
communications group, which provides  
a wide range of communications and 
advisory services including strategic 
communications, public affairs, investor 
relations and consumer marketing. grayling 
is a global integrated communications network, 
covering public relations, investor relations and 
public affairs. red is a strategic communications 
consultancy offering public relations, digital and 
content expertise. our focus is to better serve our healthcare clients by developing and adding 
capability to the group, and with a strengthening balance sheet we are well 
placed to continue to do so. we have made 
significant progress in executing our 
strategy of transforming the group into 
a healthcare marketing services-
focused business, helped by the 
acquisition of the creative engagement 
group (‘tceg’). we continued to refine and execute the 
group’s strategy during 2017. the 
restructuring of the group into four 
principal divisions following the 
acquisition of tceg gives a better 
balance to our reporting structure and 
provides greater insight into the 
performance of the group. i was delighted to welcome tceg 
into the group in july, an excellent team 
with a passion for their work.
