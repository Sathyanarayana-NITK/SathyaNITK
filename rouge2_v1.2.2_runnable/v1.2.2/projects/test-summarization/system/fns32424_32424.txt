this year has shown strong performances for the business, in which 
we have reached record highs and have concentrated on delivering 
initiatives to move forward with confidence into 2017 /18. chairman’s statement
overview of 2016/17 
the financial year ended 31 march 2017 can be 
split into two halves. in the first six months of 
the financial year, the uncertainty surrounding 
the run-up to the brexit referendum and the 
subsequent challenging markets slowed 
revenue growth. we saw a stronger performance,  
in the last six months, when improved market 
conditions, favourably impacted by the result of 
the us presidential elections, helped increase 
both revenues and profit. making investment

we are even more 
committed now to increasing 
our service proposition 
through greater use of 
technology in a way that  
is relevant to clients, 
intermediaries and our  
own advisers. it arranges 
and administers structured 
investments with a prudent and 
sensible approach. operations
although we have seen an increase in 
administrative expenses a material proportion  
of which relates to the exceptional items and 
development expenses associated with enhanced 
systems and controls for meeting higher client 
service levels and regulatory standards costs  
were strictly monitored and headcount has  
been largely restricted to incoming revenue 
earners, their support teams and administrative 
sections directly affected by our growth. the 
new and meaningful increase in the annual 
isa allowance from £15,240 to £20,000 
provides an incentive for clients to continue 
investing into our isa wrapper, enabling 
income and capital gain to remain tax 
free. it allowed the 
fear of volatility to override the enthusiasm 
for sensible investment. –  short-term lending (stl) – manages 
large direct mandates from 
institutional investors, giving them 
exposure to the uk property 
financing market. this, coupled with a 
combination of non-recurring employment 
costs and growth-related development costs, 
saw our profitability fall well below our 
expectation. this increase in the dividend 
reflects the board’s confidence in the group’s 
long-term prospects and prudent use of 
available reserves. the final 
dividend will be paid on 15 september 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 september 2017. 
strategy 
the delivery of high quality personal investment 
advice and strong investment management 
capability remains at the core of our approach. strategic report

walker crips group offers quality, trusted investment 
and wealth management services to private clients, 
intermediaries and institutions. through acquisitions, we can trace our 
roots as far back as the 18th century, 
making us one of the city of london’s 
oldest independent companies. we are moving forward 
to complete the hard yards of this exercise 
imminently. we expect this to 
continue in the coming year, but note that 
whilst the french political environment has 
become more settled, there are still important 
elections to come in italy and germany. we want to treat our clients in the way they would 
wish to be served and in the way we would expect to 
be treated. walker crips at a glance
walker crips strives to deliver 
great customer outcomes. we believe the best way to 
achieve this is by conducting 
ourselves with honesty, 
fairness and integrity. we expect all personnel to exemplify good 
culture and behaviour to achieve good 
outcomes for clients and market contacts. those aspects which need to be cascaded down 
throughout the organisation are identified by 
implementing a formal process of measuring 
and reporting against suitable metrics. last year, 
robert elliott advised the board of his intention 
to retire as a non-executive director and also as 
chairman of the audit committee and he will 
not be seeking to be re-elected to the board at 
the forthcoming agm. clive 
bouch, whom many colleagues will remember 
as a former partner with deloitte llp, has a 
long-standing relationship with the company 
and we are delighted that he has joined the 
board to serve as chairman of the audit 
committee. mitchell martin
