do you think the upcoming ban on tenancy fees 
is the right solution to make renting more secure 
for tenants? it has been widely commented on in the press that the tenancy 
fee ban will simply increase the cost of renting for many tenants. it is likely that with the introduction 
of redress for tenants from diy landlords, licensing for agents and 
the possibility of longer tenancies, standards of accommodation 
are likely to increase and encourage more people to use a 
well-functioning prs, similar to other european countries. increased regulation around property letting and licensing 
for both agents and landlords is likely to make the prospect 
of renting property without the involvement of a fully qualified 
agent less attractive. the latter underpinned the rationale of acquiring brook during 2017.
historically a lettings franchise, belvoir 
now offers both sales and lettings 
services and has nationwide coverage. board changes
finally, we say farewell to nicholas leeming as a non-executive 
director and the chairman of the remuneration committee. these acquisitions 
were undertaken by one newton fallowell, eight belvoir and 14 
northwood franchisees and added £3.3m (2016: £1.5m) to network 
revenue, 2,264 managed properties and £351,000 (2016: £243,000) 
p.a. in msf. this is a testament to the resilience of the business 
format franchising model and the responsiveness of this model to 
changing markets. i would like to take this 
opportunity to welcome michelle brook and her team to the 
belvoir group. we firmly believe that belvoir is 
best placed to take advantage of consolidation at both the franchisee 
and franchisor level. nicholas has been with us for over five years, having joined just 
after belvoir floated on aim, and in that time he has brought a wealth 
of experience and wisdom to the board. go v . go v . go v . go v . h t t p s : / / w w w . u k / emp l o y m en t an d l a b ou r m ar k e t / p e op l e i n w or k /

growth through acquisition
we are the uk’s largest property franchise group and we continue 
to grow organically by delivering award-winning service and 
through acquisition at both the franchisee and the corporate level. performance
total revenue of £11.3m was underpinned by increases in both msf 
from lettings and sales of 23% and 21% respectively, with organic 
growth being enhanced by growth from acquisitions and increased 
take-up of property sales by both the belvoir and northwood 
networks. experienced management team 
delivering significant progress
2017 marked 21 years of uninterrupted 
profit growth for the belvoir group. these figures reflect a full year of 
northwood and a part-year contribution from brook but nevertheless 
they are significant and have encouraged us to increase our dividend 
to 6.9p per share, showing our confidence in the strength of the 
group to continue to deliver on its growth strategy. as a relatively new entrant to estate agency, downward pressure 
on fees has not negatively impacted our business and in fact, 
having adjusted for the full year impact of northwood, we are 
still 10% up year on year on msf from estate agency. brook was bought by belvoir lettings 
in a deal worth £2.2m. why invest in belvoir? the barnsley-based brokerage is an appointed 
representative of the mortgage advice bureau 
and was founded by michelle brook in 2010.

our acquisition timeline
having developed a multi-brand platform, the group is looking to grow further through the acquisition of additional 
significant franchise networks or companies offering specialist property-related services from which our franchisees 
can benefit. growth
our headline figures reflect how successfully the belvoir group 
has performed in 2017. revenue increased by 14% to £11.3m 
(2016: £9.9m), operating profit of £3.9m (2016: £2.5m) is an increase 
of 56%, profit before tax of £3.9m (2016: £2.4m) is up 62%, and there 
has been a 28% improvement in the adjusted earnings per share 
(eps) to 11.3p (2016: 8.8p). we predict that the number of lettings agencies will reduce by 
20% in the next three years.
