our purpose 
our purpose is to be the company that everyone 
knows they can trust at one of the most diﬃcult times 
in their lives, now and for generations to come. a proud tradition and history of service 
we are proud of our long tradition of service. in 2017, dignity conducted 68,800 funerals which
represented approximately 11.5 per cent of total estimated
deaths in britain. in 2017, we carried out 63,400
cremations representing 10.7 per cent of total estimated
deaths in britain. 63,400
number of cremations
conducted during 2017. 450,000
number ofactive 
funeral plans as at
29 december 2017. many of our businesses have been serving their 
local communities for generations. size and scale
we operate a network 
of 826 funeral locations
throughout the uk, generally
trading under established
local names. we are the largest single operator of crematoria in
britain with a growing portfolio of well-established
and state of the art crematoria that meet the needs 
of the local communities we serve. we are one of the uk’s leading providers of pre-arranged
funeral plans and we continue to strengthen our
business in this growing market. these items have
been adjusted for in determining underlying measures of proﬁtability as these underlying measures are those used 
in the day to day management of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods. however, our ﬁnancial success was achieved against 
the backdrop of a rapidly changing and increasingly
competitive market and accelerating erosion of our market
share. it is clear that the pace of change and the ﬁerceness
of competition, particularly for our funeral business, will
continue to increase. for this reason, the board took
decisive action in january 2018 to change our pricing
strategy and market positioning in order to protect market
share and recalibrate the group for future growth. dignity plc annual report & accounts 2017
