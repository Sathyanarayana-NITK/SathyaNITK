our approach
we aim to achieve positive outcomes for those in the 
care and justice system. g4s will only offer custody, 
detention, rehabilitation and care services where we  
can access a qualified talent pool and where the  
political, legal, human rights and regulatory framework 
is consistent with our group values and results in 
acceptable operational, commercial and reputational risk. g4s takes a fully‑integrated approach to 
its strategy and corporate social responsibility. our csr approach and contribution 
to society
as a global leader in security and related services, 
corporate social responsibility is very important to g4s 
and it forms a key part of our strategy. the chief financial officer’s review 
is on pages 37 to 50.
