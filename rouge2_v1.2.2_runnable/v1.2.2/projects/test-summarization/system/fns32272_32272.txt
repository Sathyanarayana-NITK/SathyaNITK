• fall in education revenue of 
3.3% on a like‑ for‑ like* basis 
(2.8% on a gaap basis of 
53 weeks in fy17 compared 
to 52 weeks in fy16) driven 
entirely by loss of market share 
in our schools brands where sales 
were down 10.6% against the 
prior year on a like‑ for‑ like* basis
• the rest of the business showed 
growth of 2.4% on a like‑ for‑ like* 
basis against the backdrop of an 
overall market decline
• intangible assets impaired 
by £20m due to longer profit 
recovery period than previously 
anticipated, although no cash 
impact
• warehouse consolidation 
project completed on time 
and on budget, anticipated to 
deliver annual savings of £2‑ 3m 
in 2017/18
• future strategy based around 
delivering value, service, 
digital solutions and improved 
profitability is to be rolled out 
in the coming months
*  this is an alternative performance measure, for which the reconciliation to the equivalent gaap measure can be found on page 21. a 17% increase in its customer base 
to 1.6m indicates the success of that 
approach, as this business continues 
to drive the growth of the group as a 
whole. it has also seen a high level and incidence 
of individually significant items. as such, the loss before tax for 
the year was £59.4m. our business models are adapting to 
cater for a marketplace that is increasingly 
moving online. express 
gifts’ goods are generally manufactured 
outside the uk, so exposing us to the 
fluctuations in sterling at some point in 
the supply chain. all of express gifts’ customers are 
based in the uk, and findel education’s 
international customers buy in sterling. express gifts is an online and catalogue 
value retailer and trades through two 
key brands (studio and ace). why is it used? why is it used? why is it used? why is it used? both have leading positions 
in their respective markets and have 
strategies to build on the progress of 
recent years, evolving their operating 
models to cater for their customers’ 
future demands and ways of shopping. i’m excited about the opportunity for 
sustainable growth in a marketplace 
for value‑ conscious customers who are 
rapidly moving their purchases online, 
although there is a significant amount of 
further work required to achieve that goal. findel education completed 
the consolidation of its warehousing 
operations to improve future profitability 
with no disruption to its supply chain. both businesses have increased their 
capital expenditure on developing 
digital solutions to make it easier and 
more compelling for our customers 
to shop with us. no impact 
on business operations or cash 
flow, but results in an individually 
significant charge of £35.2m. since joining the group in january 2017, 
i have spent time getting to know our 
two businesses, express gifts and findel 
education. the new executive management team 
that we announced at the start of april 
2017, led by phil maudsley, have a wealth 
of relevant experience that will be used to 
deliver this growth. we have seen good progress in the last 
financial year, with express gifts moving 
its customer recruitment programme 
to be all‑ year‑ round through a focus on 
great‑value products and tv advertising. registered office:

dear shareholder,
welcome to our 2017 annual report

model. chairman’s statement
