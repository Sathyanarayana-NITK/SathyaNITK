operational highlights 
• successful maiden full year as a publicly listed company, with a solid 
trading performance. • good progress made in building a platform for future growth. • key new hires to operations and management functions. the majority of accrol’s products are private label. we supply a 
range of independents, discounters and multiples as well as a variety of afh 
customers throughout the uk. discounters’ tissue offerings are skewed towards private label and this is driving 
the growth of private label in the market as a whole. discounters typically look  
for lower prices and suppliers that offer high, sustainable volumes. with grocery inflation rising during the year, consumer 
footfall in the discount sector showed no signs of 
slowing down as shoppers continued to look for ways of 
offsetting rising household prices and switching to lower 
cost alternatives. • supply chain optimisation plan implemented to improve and simplify 
warehousing and logistics through a 368,000 sq ft. central warehouse  
at skelmersdale and managed by nft distribution. strategy and outlook
the continued oversupply of parent reels shows no sign 
of abating and as of january 2017, a further 111 tissue 
mills were on order or in their final stages, keeping 
pricing competitive and supporting our strategy to 
procure parent reels versus own manufacture. a more efficient single ‘big shed’ solution 
was adopted and a site quickly identified  
on the m58 at skelmersdale in lancashire. • tissue sourcing is under constant review to optimise pricing  
and quality. revenue

business model
our
model
our vision is to be the leading 
independent supplier of private 
label tissue products to both the 
discount and multiples sectors. dynamic sourcing
the uk consumes 1.2 million 
tonnes of tissue paper per 
annum, of which c. 0.3 million 
tonnes is imported. the group’s 
operating machinery allows conversion of a wide variety of tissue grades, 
adding flexibility to the parent reel sourcing process and allowing 
manufacture of a wide range of product types. we believe the 
ability to produce all 4 key segments is a competitive advantage. accrol is well advanced in conversations with 
customers regarding inflation recovery but they are 
challenging and will take time to conclude. our aim of gaining further own-
label business with the major multiples therefore remains  
a key strategic objective. accrol group holdings plc / annual report and accounts 2017 accrol group holdings plc / annual report and accounts 2017

product range
accrol is able to manufacture toilet rolls, kitchen rolls, facial tissue and afh 
products, providing a ‘one stop shop’ solution for customers. dividend policy
the board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy. the interim 
dividend of 2.0p per share was paid in 
february 2017. the board has proposed a 
final dividend of 4.0p per share, which 
together with the interim dividend represents 
a 6% yield at the ipo listing price. accrol imports parent reels from around the 
world and converts them into finished goods at its manufacturing, storage  
and distribution facilities in blackburn and leyland, lancashire. • opened new 168,000 sq ft. manufacturing facility at leyland, 
lancashire, with two tissue converting lines commissioned and  
a third line expected in fy18. technology and converting lines
the group currently has 17 converting lines in operation which includes  
2 recently commissioned lines at leyland. during the year, we opened our new production facility 
at leyland, lancashire, which gives us the opportunity to 
install a total of 6 tissue converting lines and the potential 
to generate revenues in excess of £100 million from the 
site, and £250 million in aggregate. leveraging strong commercial terms, flexibility 
on sourcing new technologies and better use of cash 
remain the key advantages of this sourcing strategy as 
opposed to a vertically-integrated model. the final part of the investment for growth 
strategy in fy17 was the implementation of  
a supply chain optimisation plan to improve 
and simplify warehousing and logistics, 
creating additional capacity for growth. warehouse management 
and national logistics will be contracted  
out to a 3rd-party provider, nft, enabling  
the accrol management team to focus  
on its core competencies of sourcing and 
manufacturing. low capital model
our model of purchasing  
and converting parent reels  
(as opposed to manufacturing 
the parent reels from pulp  
and recycled fibre), requires 
lower fixed overhead and 
provides flexibility in sourcing to 
capitalise on favourable pricing 
opportunities and production 
technology advancements. • focused on private label/
discounters. nft 
identified as the most suitable partner and they were appointed in 
april 2017. james flude
