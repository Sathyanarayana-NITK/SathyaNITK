we have always acted with integrity and transparency in all our 
undertakings, acknowledging our responsibility towards all our 
stakeholders. as georgia 
lacked a functioning financial system at the time of tbc bank’s 
inception, we became true pioneers in establishing a well-run 
banking institution with a long-term perspective. our experienced board of 
directors takes the leading role in framing our strategy, 
overseeing our risk management and challenging our 
performance. as already announced, two non-executive directors, stefano 
marsaglia and stephan wilcke will be leaving tbc bank and 
stepping down from the board as and when suitable replacements 
are found during 2018. i would like to extend the board’s thanks  
to both stefano and stephan for their important contributions to 
tbc bank and we wish them every success in the future. for more information visit our

focus on financial services 
tbc bank is focused on financial services activities and 99.7% of 
our total assets relate to banking, insurance, leasing, brokerage 
and corporate advisory services. another significant development in 2017 was the inclusion of our 
shares into the ftse 250 index, reflecting the improved liquidity 
of our shares and the increased valuation of our business. in 2017, georgia recorded strong economic growth with gdp 
reaching 5.0%
5
, which is one of the largest increases among 
countries in the cis and eastern europe. we have since grown side-by-side with our country 
throughout its economic and political development. key achievements
in may, we successfully completed the integration of bank republic, 
well ahead of schedule. operating environment
2017 was another remarkable year in georgia’s continued 
development. the country’s citizens were granted visa-free access 
to the schengen zone, which is a significant advancement and will 
support our deeper integration with the eu countries. built from scratch in 1992, soon after the country’s 
independence in 1991, tbc bank’s substantial growth mirrors the 
country’s fast-paced development over the last 25 years
2
. tbc bank has strong coverage across the country through its 
well-developed multichannel network serving around 75% of 
georgia’s adult population. we employ more than 7,000 highly 
skilled, loyal and motivated people, who together form a big 
“tbc family”. this year, we have developed and introduced  
the first georgian-speaking chatbot, ti bot, using facebook 
messenger. visa 
liberalisation would also have a positive impact on tourism, leading 
to increased awareness about georgia and greater tourist inflow 
from the eu. this improvement was 
mainly driven by high tourism income and an increase in net 
exports. these transportation links, coupled with free 
trade agreements with the eu, china and all major economic 
powers in the broader region, will further support the growth of 
georgia’s economy and diversify trade exports. robust growth, paired with a significant increase in 
net fee and commission income and improved efficiency, offset the 
expected reduction in the net interest margin and led to strong 
profitability.
