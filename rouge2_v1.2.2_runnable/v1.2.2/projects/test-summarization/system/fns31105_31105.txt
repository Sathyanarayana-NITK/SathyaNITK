a longstanding objective and an important 
milestone in the development of sumo group. it is always pleasing when a business’

accreditation demonstrates “very good levels 
of workplace engagement”. we are always keen to align our 
interests with those of our clients and see the 
opportunity for financial out-performance on 
new iterations of proven games. the board is particularly keen to acquire 
owner-managed businesses, where the 
vendors remain with the business post 
acquisition and where we can use our quoted 
share structure to provide suitable ongoing 
incentive arrangements. t ogether 
they have worked on some of the biggest 
franchises in the entertainment industry, 
such as avengers, mortal kombat, hitman, 
sonic all-stars and harry potter . atomhawk’s strong relationship with warner brothers continued in 
2017, working with two of the publisher’s studios, netherrealm and 
turbine, on injustice 2 and game of thrones: conquest. injustice 2 
is the fourth major game atomhawk and netherrealm have worked 
on together . working closely with epic games, sumo digital’s own-ip game snake 
pass was successfully released on the nintendo switch platform within 
a month of this new console’s release. strategic report
