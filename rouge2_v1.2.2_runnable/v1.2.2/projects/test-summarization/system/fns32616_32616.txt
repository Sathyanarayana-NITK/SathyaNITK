specials 
the specials division comprises 
three business units that 
manufacture, procure and supply 
unlicensed medicines, special 
obtains and imported medicines 
licensed abroad. the launch of glycopyrronium bromide oral 
solution 1mg/5ml (‘glyco’) in august 2016 is a 
blueprint for the type of ul2l development and 
launch that is now our priority. specials include:
• imported medicines licensed in another 
country by a regulatory body equivalent  
to the mhra;
• different forms, such as converting a tablet 
to a liquid;
• bespoke strengths;
• unusual formulations; and
• discontinued licensed products. the specials division responds to prescription 
requests from healthcare professionals. for more 
information of the uk’s prescribing hierarchy 
and the role of specials and licensed products 
within the healthcare industry, turn to page 6.
medication adherence
homecare and medication management
the group’s visibility over prescribing  
trends and growth medicines has been 
complemented by the medication adherence 
division, which dispenses and supplies 
medicines into the homecare market and 
provides medication management services 
through its innovative multi-dose tray system. medication  
adherence
the medication adherence division 
comprises two business units that 
provide products and services to 
support patients in adhering to their 
medication regime, patient-focused 
homecare services and services  
to pharmaceutical companies. the group is therefore closely aligned to  
the medicines and healthcare products 
regulatory agency’s (‘mhra’) aim of reducing 
clinical risk by subjecting medicines to the 
licensing process and effectively moving  
them up the uk prescribing hierarchy.
