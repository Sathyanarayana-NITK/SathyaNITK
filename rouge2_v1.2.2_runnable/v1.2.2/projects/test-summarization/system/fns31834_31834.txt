 purchase plan agreed for 2017/18 
brazil growing season based on our 
commercial partner’s end-user sales targets. this has created significant pressure on 
growers’ profitability and the financial 
performance of the distributors and 
input manufacturers who supply them. our aim remains to become 
the industry leader in the discovery 
and development of small molecule 
chemistry for crop yield enhancement, 
establishing this emerging category 
of agricultural inputs as one that 
growers can trust and will adopt. we made commercial 
progress in brazil, expanding our 
flagship product veritas
®
 to consolidate 
a leading market position in soybean 
crop enhancement. this enables us to create and 
identify novel synthetic and defined 
small molecule chemicals that can 
be applied as crop enhancement 
(sometimes known as biostimulant)
foliar sprays and seed treatments. there have been numerous scientific 
and technical developments in the 
areas of biostimulants, agdata, 
plant genetics and advanced sensing 
and diagnostic tools. this 2017 strategic plan (i) 
organises our r&d efforts to address 
specific plant physiological responses 
and resource prioritisation that limit 
crop yields, (ii) focuses these research 
efforts on soybeans and wheat, as initial 
models for dicot and monocot plant 
classes, (iii) embeds a replicable r&d 
platform approach to the discovery of 
new small molecules, (iv) concentrates 
product development on novel synthetic 
and defined chemistries, and (v) builds 
partnerships with companies that 
growers trust in order to commercialise 
products and fund further r&d. £4m

our strategy evolution recognises that r&d 
activities are at the core of what we are seeking to 
achieve and that these provide the main engine for 
an appreciation in long-term shareholder value. this resulted in a build 
up in channel inventory levels which 
adversely impacted bcs’s planned

what we do
we understand physiological  
stress responses and resource 
prioritisation in key world crops. our products are easy to use and 
consistently improve crop yields 
under a range of growth conditions. why we do it
increasing global demand for food 
needs to be met overwhelmingly by 
increasing yields on the existing 
world farm. the rate of crop yield 
increases is falling in all crops in 
most parts of the world. we were pleased by the support we 
received which resulted in a fund-raising 
of £4m. our update recognises 
that r&d activities are at the core of 
what we are seeking to achieve and that 
these provide the main engine for an 
appreciation in long-term shareholder 
value. as announced at the time of the 
interim results in march, the group 
is currently investigating options to 
dispose of the intellectual property 
assets related to its biological 
insecticide tgt-101. we

innovation 
thrives in a 
challenging 
environment
at plant impact this year we have invested more 
in r&d and been rewarded with advances in 
our pipeline of products. dr david jones
chairman
the last 12 months have been eventful 
ones for our industry and for our 
business. we have invested more 
in r&d and have been rewarded with a 
step advance in our pipeline of products. we are moving from a sole 
focus on the exploitation of products 
in hand, to orientating ourselves to a 
future where our r&d platform will 
significantly broaden our offer (and 
with it, of course our development 
challenge).
