the 
board will continue to monitor diversity, including across 
the business, and to take such steps as it considers 
appropriate to maintain its position as a meritocratic  
and diverse business. looking ahead 
to 2017/18, we will continue to focus on our brand, our 
products and the execution of our key strategies. our customer is evolving 
rapidly, prioritising more distinctive experiences, more 
personal relationships with brands and greater product 
innovation. the influence of digital technology is extending 
still further across every aspect of what we do – from 
production techniques to the customer experience, in every 
channel. we have made 
strategic long-term choices to strengthen the brand  
and reposition burberry for growth over time, and good 
progress with the implementation of our programme 
including the establishment of our five key pillars to 
underpin our growth and productivity agenda. this was in 
part impacted by a decrease in licensing profit due to the 
planned expiry of our japanese licences and other actions 
we have taken to build and reinforce our brand positioning. these were influenced by a challenging global environment, 
which had impacted the performance of the sector as a 
whole, as demand slowed sharply in many of burberry’s 
key markets. to stay ahead of these changes and to  
create future value for shareholders, we announced an 
acceleration of our productivity and efficiency agenda, 
particularly looking at our ways of working. annual report 2016/17  annual report

chairman’s 
letter the group ended the year with a strong cash balance  
of £809m, up £149m year-on-year after £97m of share 
buyback and £164m of dividends. good early progress against burberry’s ambitious plans. we wish them all the 
best for the future. financial performance and shareholder returns
as a whole, the luxury sector has continued to remain 
challenging during the year, with some signs of 
improvement during the second half. further changes are planned  
over the coming year. this  
was reflected in the outperformance of fashion during  
the year, including the growth of our runway collections  
and the successful introduction of our new, lightweight 
tropical gabardine. this is the 
essence of who we are, and what we do – and my passion 
for making burberry the most compelling brand, selling the 
most beautiful and finely crafted products, in the most 
innovative ways has never been stronger. 16

strategic report – burberry group overview
brand highlights
burberry’s ambition is to bring pioneering british creativity and culture to the world by creating beautifully made products, 
inspiring with storytelling and shared experiences, delivering impeccable and distinctive services, and continually innovating. the exhibition 
featured over 40 of his sculptures, monumental bronzes, 
working models, drawings and maquettes. alongside this, a programme of events featured acoustic 
performances and workshops including life drawing, 
maquette and object making, textile printmaking and  
textile design. inspired by the scale and form of moore’s elemental 
sculptures, each design was made using unique 
constructions and referencing elements from the  
burberry archive. the collection includes top handle, satchel and luggage 
inspired styles for men and women. each of these will have a set of challenging,  
public-facing goals and a flagship programme to be 
delivered hand-in-hand with expert partners. from september 2016, burberry replaced its four-
show calendar of two mens and two womens shows, with 
two shows. the september and february shows featured 
both womenswear and menswear collections. in february, 
burberry partnered with the henry moore foundation to 
create an exhibition of moore’s working methods and the 
evolution of his iconic sculptural ideas. the following messages from sir john peace and christopher bailey highlight  
burberry’s performance during the year and the outlook for the company. sir john peace
chairman
as carol fairweather and john smith had signalled  
their intention to step down as chief financial officer  
and chief operating officer respectively, focus was  
also on the succession of these roles, with the decision  
to combine them to align with the change programme. the board unanimously supported the appointment of 
marco gobbetti as chief executive officer who will join  
the board on 5 july 2017 (with christopher transitioning  
to his new role at that time), and julie brown who joined  
the board as chief operating and financial officer on  
18 january 2017. the board believes that the combination  
of christopher’s creative talent and vision for burberry  
and marco’s extensive skills in luxury and retail, as  
well as julie’s financial and commercial track record,  
will provide strong leadership for the next phase of 
burberry’s evolution. the board would like to thank carol fairweather for her 
immense contribution to burberry over the past ten years, 
and john smith for his contribution to burberry over the 
past seven years, first as a non-executive director and 
latterly as chief operating officer. in line with our evolved strategy 
for the category, this was driven both by new launches such 
as the bridle and buckle bags, as well as increasing novelty 
in our more established styles. within service, we increased our investment in training  
and introduced a new service model (‘client’), and  
we are currently embedding a new global customer 
feedback programme based on net promoter scores. a standout area of progress here 
was our omni-channel programme, which has significantly 
increased the amount of product available to our online 
customers by enabling us to fulfil e-commerce orders  
from store stock. e-commerce leadership
through early investment and focus, we have established  
a leading position in digital in our industry, with more  
than 48 million followers on social media worldwide  
and a ‘genius’ ranking from the influential think-tank l2. burberry has delivered 2016/17 revenues of £2.8bn  
(down 2% underlying), and adjusted profit before tax of 
£462m (up £42m and down 21% underlying). consequently, the  
board has recommended a 5% increase in the full year 
dividend to 38.9p, in line with our progressive dividend 
policy resulting in a 50% pay-out ratio based on adjusted 
earnings per share. revenue was £2.8bn for the year, down 2% underlying,  
with retail outperforming at up 3% overall and up  
1% on a comparable store sales basis. we ended the year with a strong net cash position, up 
£149m to £809m, and we increased the full year dividend 
to 38.9p, up 5%.
