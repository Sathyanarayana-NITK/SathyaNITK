in spain, we enhanced our platform with 
the acquisition of madrid xanadú and 
advanced our plans for the world-class 
intu costa del sol shopping resort. nowhere will this be more obvious  
than at our ground-up scheme in  
spain, intu costa del sol, where we  
have the opportunity to create a world-
class centre, delivering our signature  
shopping resort product and  
showcasing our expertise. in spain, we now own three top-10 
centres and are on target to begin the 
construction of intu costa del sol. intu costa del sol
with ﬁnal planning consents expected  
shortly and strong demand from retailers,  
we expect to be on site with this shopping 
resort development in the next 12 months. we are a people business and everything we 
do is guided by our culture and our values. we are passionate about providing people 
with their perfect shopping experience so  
that our retailers ﬂourish. our success has come from ensuring our 
centres are the places where people want 
to be. we take our responsibilities 
seriously, whether that is ensuring we 
reduce our environmental impact or 
helping local people by working with  
a charity to provide prom dresses for 
students. intu accelerate is just one example of this, 
testing out a range of pioneering ideas for 
both customers and retailers. retailers are ﬁnding 
ingenious ways to shape their technological 
infrastructures, deﬁne their online presence 
and drive engagement with customers. this year we 
began working with seven tech start-ups  
as part of intu accelerate, our incubator 
programme, which has been trialling a 
range of new ideas in our shopping centres, 
from robotic customer services assistants 
to an online personal shopper service. for our retailers, it relates to 
how many customers we attract and how long they stay in our centres. as 
the prime shopping destination in 
the northwest, with a catchment 
of nearly 10 million, it is no 
wonder it is often the ﬁrst stop for 
retailers as they expand outside 
central london. intu lakeside offers its loyal 
customer base from essex and the 
southeast a compelling mix of 
retail, catering and leisure at the 
heart of nearly 5 million sq ft of 
retail space in the wider lakeside 
basin. the centre is popular  
with families – which is why 
nickelodeon has chosen  
intu lakeside for its ﬁrst theme  
park in a uk shopping centre. jd sports, river island 
and topshop have recently 
upsized, creating ﬂagship stores, 
with next following. and it’s this that powers our business, creating 
opportunity for our retailers and value for 
our investors; beneﬁting our communities 
and driving our long-term success. underlying 
earnings is used by management to assess the underlying performance of the 
business and is based on an industry standard comparable measure. our vibrant centres are the 
best in their regions and are continuously 
changing to meet new customer and 
retailer needs created by today’s 
multichannel retail world. this constant 
evolution is directed by our experienced 
and ambitious management team  
whose drive is shaping the shopping 
centre industry. see ﬁnancial review on page 48 for more details on the presentation of information

 — at intu costa del sol, our proposed 230,000 sq m shopping resort development, approval of the general plan  
of torremolinos was a major step forward. it draws 18 million visits  
each year and is a key location  
for retailers. our purpose is to make customers 
smile, leading to strong footfall, increased 
dwell time and higher spend, and this, in 
turn, helps our retailers ﬂourish – resulting 
in high occupancy and near record levels 
of lettings and tenant investment. page 38
