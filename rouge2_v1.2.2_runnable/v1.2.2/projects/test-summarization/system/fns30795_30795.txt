financial statements governance strategic report overview
01 savills is a global real estate services provider listed on the  
london stock exchange. investment management 
revenue declined as anticipated, reflecting the 
reduced level of disposal transactions from 
the liquidating seb german open ended 
funds we inherited as part of the acquisition 
of seb asset management in 2015.
the reduction in transaction fees in the 
investment management business, together 
with a decline in the volume of larger 
complex transactions in the us and the 
costs of expansion in a number of markets 
restricted the underlying profit margin to 
8.8% (2016: 9.4%). the highly targeted marketing campaign resulted in  
a sale for £141.5m, a significant premium to the asking terms and reflecting  
a sub 5% niy. our transaction advisory revenue grew by 
13%, our consultancy business revenue by 
14% and our property management revenue 
by 9%, including the full year effect of the 
2016 uk acquisition of gbr phoenix beard. our residential 
businesses withstood challenging conditions 
achieving revenue growth of over 6%. the statutory pre-tax 
profit margin remained stable at 7.0% (2016: 
6.9%), with lower acquisition-related costs 
and profits on disposal of investments 
offsetting the aforementioned expansion 
costs and decline in the us business. taken 
together, the ordinary and supplemental 
dividends comprise an aggregate 
distribution for the year of 30.2p per share, 
representing an increase of 4% on the 2016 
aggregate dividend of 29.0p. we have an international network  
of over 600 offices and associates and over 34,000 staff 
throughout the americas, the uk, continental europe, asia 
pacific, africa and the middle east, offering a broad range of 
specialist advisory, management and transactional services  
to clients all over the world. against the uncertain backdrop of world 
markets, savills commercial transaction 
business grew revenue by 15% with strong 
performances in many markets including the 
uk and significant growth in the asia pacific 
region, in particular, hong kong, china, 
japan and australia. during 2017, we continued to build our us 
presence with the acquisition of cresa 
orange county, a tenant representation 
business in california and the hire of a 
significant new capital markets team in new 
york. in asia pacific, we made some 
significant hires in investment sales teams in 
beijing and shanghai. savills at a glance

the measure
profitability after all operating 
costs but before the impact of 
exceptional costs and taxation. overview
savills delivered a further strong performance 
in 2017 . in the uk, we completed a 
number of team hires across our business 
lines together with the acquisitions of a 
residential lettings business (granville 
residential ltd – marlow) and a 
commercially focused business in guernsey 
(montagu evans channel islands ltd). one example is  
the formation of workthere.com, savills 
innovative response to the changing 
requirements of occupiers seeking serviced 
office/co-working space in global cities. our largest investment to date is  
in yopa, the digital hybrid residential uk 
estate agent. in addition to substantial commercial 
transaction volumes in both the uk and a 
number of asian and european markets, 
the relative resilience of savills uk 
residential transaction business, which 
achieved year-on-year revenue growth in 
challenging markets, was of particular note. this again demonstrated the importance of 
savills strengths in prime markets of many 
of the world’s key cities where we increased 
market share. we anticipate some tempering 
of the strong transaction volumes of recent 
times in some markets. demand for logistics space has been rising across europe, 
driven by improved economic conditions, rising trade volumes, 
and expanding e-commerce. 18
