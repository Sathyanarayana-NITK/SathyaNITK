chairman’s statement
in a year characterised by 
significant political events and 
the market uncertainty that 
inevitably comes with that, i am 
pleased to say that workspace 
has performed strongly. we actively manage 
the assets to drive income 
growth and capital value. alongside the intensive 
management of our 
properties, it helps 
us to drive income 
growth and long-term 
value for shareholders. we have continued to deliver 
strong results with a 6.9% 
increase in net rental income, to 
£79.2m, and a 3.3% increase in 
epra nav per share, to £9.53. thanks to this focus, 
and the strong trading profit 
growth we delivered as a result, 
the board is recommending a 
40% increase in the interim and 
final dividend for the period. *

like-for-like rent roll. the data and insight this 
provides allow us to remain 
ahead of the industry in 
constantly enhancing our 
offer and facilities. the 
resilience of the business, 
underpinned by the right 
strategy and a clear customer 
focus resulting in ongoing 
demand for our offer, reinforces 
our conviction around our 
business model. our focus is on driving income 
across our portfolio, efforts 
which have been enhanced 
during the year by the successful 
letting up of our completed 
projects. looking forward, with a strong 
pipeline of refurbishments and 
redevelopments, ongoing 
demand for our space from a 
growing customer market and a 
strong balance sheet to take 
advantage of further acquisition 
opportunities, i feel confident in 
workspace’s ability to deliver 
value to shareholders over the 
long term. workspace at a glance

project pipeline (000 sq. london bridge: well connected
it is vital for our properties to 
be well connected and many are 
situated in clusters around major 
transport hubs. within walking 
distance of london bridge, one 
of the busiest commuter areas 
of london, we have four business 
centres, including the metal box 
factory and the leather market. this is the workspace 
advantage and it sits at 
the centre of our strategy. with the customer every step of the way 
workspace is unique in that every 
touch point with its customers, 
from their initial enquiry to the lease 
negotiation, is handled by a member 
of the in-house team. 1. search for space 
the majority of customers find 
workspace online thanks to our in-house 
marketing team and digital marketing 
strategy, while we also have a strong 
recommendation rate from existing 
customers and their clients. 2. enquiry 
the enquiries team speaks to the 
customer about their requirements  
and outlines available options.
