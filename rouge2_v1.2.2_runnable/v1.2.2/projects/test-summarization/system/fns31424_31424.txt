whitewash resolution
the directors are seeking authority to purchase 
up to a maximum of 1,510,424 ordinary shares 
(being equivalent to approximately 10% of the 
company’ s issued share capital). strategy
the building of a portfolio of participations on 
leading lloyd’ s syndicates remains the strategic 
objective of the group. were the 
aggregate interests of the concert party in 
the voting rights of the company to reach 
30% or more as a result of the proposed 
buyback, the members of the concert party 
would be required to make a mandatory offer 
under rule 9 of the city code. the takeover panel may waive the 
requirement for a general offer to be made 
in accordance with rule 9 if, amongst other 
things, the shareholders of a company who 
are independent of the person who would 
otherwise be required to make an offer, and 
any person acting in concert with it, pass an 
ordinary resolution on a poll approving such 
a waiver. accordingly, the company has prepared a 
circular and related resolutions for consideration 
by the independent shareholders at the 
annual general meeting, notice of which 
is being circulated with the annual report 
and financial statements. • active management of risk through use of quota share and 
stop loss reinsurance. total 
costs of £1.8m included the expenditure 
on protecting the portfolio using stop loss 
reinsurance and foreign exchange losses 
from the strengthening of the us$. given the uncertainty generated as 
to valuation of llvs in the second half of the 
year arising from the natural catastrophes, 
the flow of potential acquisitions slowed. with prospective 2017 underwriting year 
losses and the reduction in the value of 
capacity, there is the prospect of acquiring 
further llvs in the future at lower prices. • helios has expanded its portfolio of syndicate capacity from 
£12.9m in 2013 to £41.0m as at may 2018. position as at may 2018.

strategic report
overview of helios underwriting plc
why us? these participations 
in syndicates managed by these managing agents represent shares in the better managed businesses at lloyd’s. the core of the panel of reinsurers 
remains xl group plc and everest reinsurance 
bermuda limited. • open exposure to 2018 underwriting year reduced to £12.3m. the full impact of the 2017 losses on the helios 
portfolio of £5.8m was mitigated by the use 
of quota share and stop loss reducing the net 
loss for 2017 to £1.9m. underwriting profits from the two older 
underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made 
a good contribution but the 2017 underwriting 
year in its first 12 months recognised a 
significant loss following the series of natural 
catastrophes in the second half of 2017. 
other income arising from fees from 
reinsurers, recoveries from reinsurance 
policies and investment income have 
contributed to this year results. capacity acquired
during 2017 a further five corporate members were acquired that increased the capacity for 
the 2015 to 2017 years of account as shown below. each of nigel hanbury, hampden 
capital limited, nicholas wentworth-stanley, 
jeremy evans, sir michael oliver, peter nutting, 
timothy oliver and his immediate family 
members are considered by the panel to be 
acting in concert, as the concert party, in 
respect of the company and together, as the 
concert party are interested in 29.62% of the 
company’s issued share capital. board 
this is my first report as your chairman and i
