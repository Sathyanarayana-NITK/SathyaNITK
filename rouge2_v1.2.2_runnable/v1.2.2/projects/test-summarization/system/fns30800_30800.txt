this section tells the story of 
our strategy – what it is, why 
it’s a winner, and how we have 
performed against it in 2017. following ruth’s 
appointment, our board (excluding me 
as chairman) comprises a majority of 
independent directors, and we are 
confident that it has the right balance 
of skills and experience to support the 
executive team. 2017 has been a significant year in the 
company’s history and i feel privileged 
to be chairman at this exciting time 
in contourglobal’s development. on 
behalf of the board, i would like to 
thank our management team and all 
of our nearly 2,000 employees across 
19 countries for their continued 
dedication and hard work. making

2 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc annual report 2017 contourglobal plc 3 contourglobal was founded 12 years ago and 
since then has successfully grown into a global 
platform of contracted power generation with 
expertize across wind, solar photovoltaic, 
hydro and thermal technologies. we focus on investing in and making the most 
of long‑term contracted power generation in 
underserved markets. we currently have a mix of 84 thermal and 
renewable power generation assets in 19 countries 
across europe, latin america and africa. in line with our opportunistic, disciplined growth 
strategy, we concentrate on increasing the 
performance and value of our existing assets while 
also looking to capitalize on new opportunities. the energy we generate has a positive impact 
for people, businesses and communities around 
the world – powering cities, providing heat and 
light for people, keeping businesses running round 
the clock. we have 84 thermal and 
renewable power generation 
assets in europe, latin america 
and africa with a total installed 
capacity of 4.2 gw. contourglobal is organized 
into two divisions: thermal 
and renewable. the thermal group consists 
of plants using conventional 
fuels, specifically natural gas, 
coal, liquid fuels and diesel. the renewable group consists 
of plants using renewable 
resources of wind, solar 
photovoltaic and hydropower. our assets 
have a total installed capacity of 4.16 gw. below we share our financial 
and operational highlights for 2017.

we develop, acquire, 
own and operate wholesale 
power generation businesses. we manage risk by underpinning 
the vast majority of our revenues 
with long-term contracts with 
creditworthy counterparties 
delivering predictable cash 
flows (over 91% over the 
next five years). more details on the 
board and appointments can be found 
in the governance section on pages 
50 to 53. 
corporate governance 
at ipo, the company became subject to 
the corporate governance requirements 
of the uk listing authority’s listing rules, 
and the uk corporate governance 
code (the “code”). in the months 
leading up to the listing, much work 
was carried out to ensure that the 
board had constituted appropriate 
committees and adopted relevant 
policies and procedures to support the 
development of a robust governance 
structure and compliance with the 
code. this work is described more 
fully in our corporate governance 
report on pages 54 to 59. the board 
is satisfied that we have in place a 
robust governance structure, which 
is fit for purpose and in line with our 
listed status, and we will ensure that 
our governance arrangements will adapt 
if appropriate in connection with the 
new uk corporate governance code 
anticipated to come into force in 2019. 
dividends 
our dividend policy is unchanged 
since the ipo (as described in detail 
on page 80). contourglobal also achieved the 
lowest health and safety incident rate 
in our history, demonstrating our 
commitment to providing a safe 
working environment for employees, 
contractors and subcontractors. contourglobal 
has benchmarked in the top decile 
of operating performance in the 
global power industry over the 
past several years. our team has also demonstrated the 
ability to increase contracted revenue 
through: (i) expansion opportunities, 
where marginal economics are even 
more accretive due to the utilization of 
existing infrastructure; (ii) repowering 
opportunities where technology has 
improved dramatically; and (iii) contract 
extensions that extract additional 
profitability from assets when their 
useful lives extend beyond the 
original contracted period. these “farm-downs” 
significantly bolster our project returns. we significantly progressed a number 
of major projects, successfully 
integrated prior acquisitions, and ended 
the year on a strong financial footing, 
with significant liquidity for growth. capacity split

6 annual report 2017 contourglobal plc annual report 2017 contourglobal plc 7 2. proven ability to create 
value post‑acquisition 
contourglobal’s exceptional operating 
team has consistently reduced costs 
at projects, while improving operating 
efficiency and maintaining an excellent 
health and safety record. 2011 
acquired maritsa, 
a 908 mw lignite 
fired power plant in 
bulgaria, and arrubal, 
an 800 mw combined-
cycle gas turbine plant 
in northern spain. 2015 
began operating 
the 205 mw chapada i 
wind farm in brazil. acquired the 404 mw 
vorotan hydroelectric 
plant in armenia. we primarily look at transactions with 
long-term contracted cash flows to 
creditworthy counterparties. we believe that this 
resilience creates a higher quality risk 
adjusted cash flow for shareholders. these diversification benefits were 
on display in 2017 as we were able to 
outperform our adjusted ebitda target. contracted plants 
have minimal exposure to market prices for 
the duration of the underlying contract because 
the price is negotiated and fixed upfront. 1. disciplined, opportunistic 
approach to allocating capital 
contourglobal has demonstrated 
operational and development expertize 
across seven fuel types and four 
continents. the airbags 
did not deploy on our vehicle as they 
should have. to obtain training records 
and introduce drivers’ training programs 
to encourage defensive driving and 
appropriate risk assessment particularly 
in remote areas. and with just 
a bit of luck, enable us to achieve 
target zero in 2018.
we also had a very strong operating 
year with better than target 
availabilities in our thermal fleet and 
most of our renewable fleet.
