board of directors
nigel terrence payne 
non-executive chairman 
(member of audit and remuneration committees)
nigel has over 25 years of experience as a director of both 
publicly listed and private companies. he has extensive experience 
of listing companies and fundraising, notably in his current role 
as non-executive chairman of gateley plc, non-executive 
chairman of ecsc plc, non-executive director of getbusy plc 
and until recently non-executive chairman of eg solutions plc. nigel is also the former ceo of sportingbet plc. the company has an international reach in the mobile 
social gaming market with a focus on north america. the group’s scale, technological edge and 
multi-brand strategy mean that it is very well positioned to continue 
to grow and take market share despite external industry pressures. stride gaming has 
grown its market share in its core uk bingo-led online gaming 
market, continued to develop new growth opportunities 
through product innovation, enhanced its proprietary technology 
platform and appraised attractive new markets for future 
expansion opportunities. strategic progress
stride’s progress during the year has continued to be 
underpinned by the group’s first-class proprietary technology, 
leading business intelligence capabilities and clear focus on 
operating in markets where it is legal to do so. on poc, the group has engaged 
the services of tax advisors to better 
understand the general expectation 
of the industry. the group has a strong operating team 
which is working to update all systems 
including its reporting tools to comply 
with the new poc tax regulation and 
group budgets have been updated 
to include the anticipated monetary 
impact on the group’s results. in respect of the 
forthcoming eu general data protection 
regulation (“gdpr”), the group has 
engaged the services of a consultancy 
firm to provide professional advice 
and guidance on gdpr in order to fully 
assess the implications for the group. if the group 
inadvertently handles any proceeds of 
crime, it may be committing money 
laundering offences under the uk 
proceeds of crime act 2002 and similar 
legislation in other jurisdictions in 
which the group operates. regulation, responsibility and compliance remain a major 
focus in the group’s core uk market. given the changing market dynamics, the 
company made the decision to reduce marketing spend in this 
vertical and to implement significant changes in order to mitigate 
the expected reduction in revenues. as a group we 
should only be accepting players from 
regulated and legalised markets, and 
this is one of our main principles. if we 
accept players from non-regulated 
jurisdictions, we run a risk of breaching 
legislation in that particular market. results and dividend
the group delivered a strong set of financial results in the year 
with net gaming revenue (“ngr”) up 18% on a pro-forma basis 
to £89.9 million (2016: pro-forma £76.4 million and reported 
£47.8 million). like-for-like adjusted ebitda increased by 24% 
to £20.2 million (2016: pro-forma £16.3 million and reported 
£12.3 million) and like-for-like adjusted earnings rose by 29% 
to £18.5 million (2016: pro-forma £14.3 million). in line 
with the group’s strategic focus, real money gaming ngr 
generated from stride’s proprietary platform increased by 
39% to £48.6 million, accounting for 54% of group revenue 
(2016: pro-forma of 31% to £34.9 million accounting for 45% 
and reported: 73%). real money gaming ngr from third-party 
non-proprietary platforms also increased by 16% to £33.1 million, 
accounting for 36% of group revenue (2016: pro-forma 
£28.6 million, accounting for 37%). leading online
