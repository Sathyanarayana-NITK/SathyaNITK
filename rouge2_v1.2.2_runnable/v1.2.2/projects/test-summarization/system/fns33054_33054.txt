group sales were £6,125m, 5% lower
than 2001, largely as a consequence of
divestments, principally in the regional and
industrial businesses, and adverse exchange
rate movements. trading profit for the international
businesses (national starch, quest,
performance specialties and paints) was
£543m, 5% below 2001, but only 1% lower
on a comparable basis with paints 9% up
and national starch 5% up offset by the
performance of quest, 23% lower, and
performance specialties, 24% lower. ici annual report and accounts and form 20-f 2002

class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve
satisfactory financial results. mania for men, eau torride, glow, bora bora and washpoint are

the widespread optimism that we would see a recovery
in the major economies around the globe, stronger stock
markets and rising consumer confidence. the majority
of our major markets, with the notable exception of china,
experienced little or no economic growth and fragile
consumer confidence. the weakness in global stock markets and the effect on
individual and household net worth and consumer sentiment
gave cause for widespread concern, as did the continuing
anxiety over the threat of terrorism and, particularly in the
latter half of the year, the increased threat to global security. ‘company’ means imperial chemical industries plc. ‘ici’, ‘ici group’
