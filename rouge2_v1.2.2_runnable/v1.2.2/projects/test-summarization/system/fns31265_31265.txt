each unit 
meets industry standards for exposure, size and proportion, 
exposure clarity, duration, proximity to action, and prominence. to build efficiency each of these offices is 
linked to provide support to each other guided by the centre 
in london. i would like to express the gratitude of the board to all our staff, 
both longer serving and more recently joined, who have contributed 
to the development of the business. retention and recruitment will be key to the group’s future success. the board is confident that the group can scale revenues 
by ensuring that its key customers are provided with the 
transactional tools and training needed to facilitate in‑video 
advertising. this is why the group has spent considerable time 
and resource in developing a transactional tool which we call 
marketplace. while the group’s 
contracts do not guarantee an immediate flow of revenue 
they are critical markers of future success. our team of experts and specialists have developed all of our 
intellectual property, our business processes and know‑how 
that form the basis for our unique proposition. a chinese 
application was confirmed as pending in august 
• grant funding secured from eureka eurostars for 
the valence project in february (total funding of 
£298k over the period of the grant)
