admiral group has delivered another record 
set of results in 2017: record turnover and 
profit, strong return on capital, strong 
solvency ratio and record customer numbers. in line 
with usual trends, profitability benefited 
from significant prior year reserve releases. there is still a backdrop of uncertainty in 
our largest business, uk car, due to the 
continued deliberations over the ogden rate 
affecting large personal injury claims. we 
expect to see some conclusions on the way 
forward in 2018. in the meantime, we have 
taken a prudent approach and reflected the 
current discount rate in our reserves. 376.8

“ it’s 25 years since the launch of admiral. the 
group’s solvency ratio remains very strong 
at 205%. with “an intention to renew after a claim” score 
of consistently well over 90% (94.5% in 2017 
to be precise) we deliver for our customers at 
the moment of truth. q
what was the outcome of this year’s 
excess of loss reinsurance renewals  
and how was this influenced by ogden? outside the uk, admiral owns  
four insurance and three price  
comparison businesses. the group has offices in eight  
countries across the world. 1993 1995 1997

the journey so far …
we launched in 1993 with 0 customers,  
1 brand and 57 staff. today we have over 5 million customers 
worldwide, 17 brands and 9,000 staff. as chairman of the group i will focus my 
efforts on: 
• continuing to build on the remarkably 
special admiral culture and in so doing 
putting our people and customers at  
the heart of what we do
• continuing the history of growth, 
profitability and innovation
• investing in the development and  
growth of our people
• ensuring excellent governance 
and the highest standards. we continue to invest heavily 
in improving our core skills as evidenced 
by our continuing growth in premiums and 
profit. we expect this to be an 
increasingly significant part of our business 
in future. as a result of brexit, we are exploring 
establishing an insurance company and an 
insurance intermediary business in spain to 
support our european operations. overall we believe that people who like what 
they do, do it better. far from it. not every time. we make mistakes. the group has continued to grow strongly 
with turnover increasing by 15% to £2.96 
billion. customer numbers increased 11% to 
over 5.7 million. the group’s share of pre-tax profit increased 
by 43% to £405.4 million. earnings per share 
and return on equity both increased by 49% 
to 117.2 pence and 55% respectively. 01 admiral group plc · annual report and accounts 2017

“ on behalf of the board, i would like to thank all the 9,600 people at admiral for  
their continued hard work and contribution to a record-breaking set of results  
for the group in 2017.”
i am delighted and honoured to have taken 
over the helm as the chairman of admiral 
at the agm in april 2017. my predecessor, 
alastair lyons, who ably steered the ship for 
over 16 years, has left some large shoes to 
fill. i would like to thank him for his service 
and enabling a smooth transition. customers buy from us either 
using price comparison sites, directly and, 
increasingly, using our multicover offering, 
building on the success of multicar. we believe we are on the cusp of 
delivering long term profit for the group.
