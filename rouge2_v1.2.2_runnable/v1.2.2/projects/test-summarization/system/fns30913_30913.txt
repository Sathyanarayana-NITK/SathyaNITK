our asset 
portfolio has been materially repositioned. as it is, the pressures we have faced from 
this quarter in our important home market 
have raised the degree of competitive 
difficulty and created an air of uncertainty 
that weighed heavily on our share price 
in 2017 . the impact of competitive and pricing 
pressures here was exacerbated by a 
seasonally weak performance from our 
north american gas business and the 
discovery of an historical accounting issue. but not before deep damage had been 
done to confidence in the company and 
its prospects, with commensurate harm to 
our share price layered on top of the impacts 
of the current political uncertainty. everything we do is focused 
on satisfying the changing 
needs of our customers. we aim to be a good corporate citizen 
and an employer of choice. we are focused on delivering high levels of 
customer service, engagement and loyalty. to that end, we in particular need to focus 
more on our weakest performance if we are 
truly to improve customer experience levels 
and open up the powerful possibility of our 
customers becoming our advocates. we are seeing 
encouraging signs of progress in our 
customer-facing businesses. this would be a tough undertaking even in a 
benign and supportive political environment. our response has been to strive to make 
centrica more resilient to our external 
environment. this requires a fundamental 
repositioning of our organisation, processes 
and systems, integrating a hitherto 
fragmented structure, always in the service 
of our customers. contents

unless otherwise stated, all references to operating profit or loss, taxation, cash flow, earnings and earnings per share 
throughout the strategic report are adjusted figures, reconciled to their statutory equivalents in the group financial review 
on pages 48 to 51. see also notes 2, 4 and 10 to the financial statements on pages 117 and 118, 121 to 126 and 134 and 135, 
for further details of these adjusted performance measures. adjusted operating profit 
at £1.25 billion was down 17%, earnings 
were down 22%, at £698 million, equivalent 
to 12.6 pence per share. adjusted operating 
cash flow was £2.07 billion. ebitda of 
£2.14 billion was down 9%. i am disappointed that the many 
actions we have taken to help vulnerable 
customers, bring old tariff models to an 
end and reward loyalty have received little 
recognition from politicians. this must all necessarily 
be executed at pace, because to stand 
still in our fast-moving sector is to invite 
obsolescence, and because our employees 
understandably want to get to the other side 
as quickly as possible. the strategic transition is being delivered well 
and all of our declared financial targets have 
been met. but there have also been areas of 
weakness, particularly in our north american 
power book during the second half of the 
year. so, we believe the answer to be clear. we believe it now.
