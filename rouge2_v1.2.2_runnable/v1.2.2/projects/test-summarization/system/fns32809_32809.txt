while the company’s focus is on developing low-cost vertically integrated vanadium operations, the company 
has multiple projects organised around three commodity-focused platforms through which it will unlock  
value for its shareholders:
bushveld vanadium – aims to become the largest, lowest-
cost, integrated primary vanadium producer globally through 
its owned high-grade assets. • potential re-rating of a coal project 
in madagascar on the back of an 
ipp licence turning the project into 
a >$200m mining and power 
generation project. meanwhile, identifying catalysts for unlocking value 
in the pq project, which is based on the same mineral 
licence as the mokopane vanadium project, and 
comprises the pq iron & titanium project, and the  
pq phosphate project. securing an ipp licence for thermal coal power 
generation and completing a bankable feasibility 
study in partnership with sinohydro, our strategic 
partner for development of the power plant,  
and supporting transmission infrastructure  
in madagascar. • signed cooperation agreement 
between the industrial development 
corporation of south africa (“idc”) 
and bushveld energy limited 
(“bushveld energy”, a subsidiary  
 
of bushveld minerals limited) for  
the joint development of market 
opportunities for vanadium redox 
flow batteries (“vrfbs”) in africa. • completed a techno-economic study 
on the manufacturing of electrolyte 
in south africa. • completed a market study for vrfbs 
in africa. • access to deep technical and 
general management skills in the 
commodities of focus (over 100 
years combined experience in the 
vanadium industry). each of the three platforms  
has made strides in realising its objectives.”  06

business review
chief executive officer’s report
it gives me great pleasure to present this annual 
report, following an eventful and indeed 
transformational year for bushveld minerals limited. production 
volumes in 2016 were a solid 2 804mtv, a 16% 
increase on 2015 volumes of 2 419mtv. the resource vanadium grades are some  
of the highest primary grades in the world with over 
2.0% v

 (in magnetite). the 
project comprises one of the world’s largest primary 
vanadium resources as well as high in-situ (1.4%)  
and in-concentrate (1.75%) v

o

 grades. the power project 
will provide a captive market for the imaloto coal 
project and see the planned project capital 
investment grow from an initial estimate of  
us$16m to over us$200m. this intellectual capital will be important as we look 
to grow the combined bushveld vanadium platform 
from its current 3.5% market share of the global 
vanadium supply to a share projected at more than 
10% in the next three to five years. us$14 million of 
the us$16.5 million acquisition consideration was 
fully repaid within three months of the completion  
of the transaction. the volume 
increase and weakening south african exchange rate 
(from zar12.75:us$1 in 2015 to zar$14.71:us$1) in 
addition to improved operational performance saw 
vametco improve its already low production costs 
from us$17.23/kgv to us$14.50/kgv. • completed the acquisition of the 
brits vanadium project from sable 
metals limited. 02

chairman’s report
i am delighted to present the annual financial 
statements of bushveld minerals for the year ended 
28 february 2017 . at the same time we outlined our 
intention to prioritise vanadium as the flagship of 
the company. i am pleased to report that the company has been 
disciplined and consistent in delivering on this 
strategy. i am encouraged to see the prominence  
and attention given to the lemur power project  
by the government, including the presidency of 
madagascar at the recent madagascar investment 
conference hosted by the south african government 
in pretoria during mid-june 2017 . efforts to list the 
greenhills resources platform separately are now 
well underway and expected to be completed during 
the next financial year. in 
addition, the management team has worked on 
every one of the primary vanadium-processing 
plants in south africa. i look 
forward to seeing continued progress on what has 
been achieved to date over the course of the 
coming year. www.bushveldminerals.com
