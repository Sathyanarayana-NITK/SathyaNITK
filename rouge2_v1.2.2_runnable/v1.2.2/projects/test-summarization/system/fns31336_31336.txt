the acquisitions of vmc and sperasoft

in which the group trades, such as the 
canadian dollar, euro, yen, renminbi  
and rupee, is being monitored and some  
us dollars denominated pricing may be 
adjusted accordingly. • valuation – we don’t overpay but are fair:
• most targets have a financial fragility despite being 
very good suppliers; 
• valuations have averaged 1x revenue or 5-10x ebitda. another driver of growth has been esports

access to high growth market
keywords operates in an exciting high growth 
market, without the risk of direct exposure to 
the successes or failures of individual game 
titles and our focus on content means that  
we are platform agnostic. the increased 
sophistication of games and complexity of 
the video games market is driving demand  
for larger, professional, outsourced specialists, 
such as keywords, in a highly fragmented 
supplier market. it has a strong market position with customers from many of the well-known 
multi-national games publishers and developers including 23 out of the 25 
largest games companies by revenue. 02 keywords studios plc

service provision
the market continues to be very fragmented 
with a large number of small specialist 
suppliers available to choose from and,  
in order to meet the growing demand from 
the global video games market, companies 
are having to adapt their service provision for 
the most part due to the changing demands 
from customers. according to goldman sachs, an m&a cycle 
should benefit the scale players such as

market overview
no signs of slowing
the global games market is constantly 
growing and developing with consumers 
spending more time than ever on games,  
as regular updates to consoles smooth and 
lengthen their cycles, whilst a trend towards 
the portability of consoles helps extend 
“screen time”. data suggests this won’t be stopping 
any time soon, with revenues set to reach 
almost $130 billion by 2020 representing a 
compound annual growth rate (“cagr”)  
of around 6%. see more on page 18. see more on page 18. see more on page 20. see more on page 20. synergistic growth
