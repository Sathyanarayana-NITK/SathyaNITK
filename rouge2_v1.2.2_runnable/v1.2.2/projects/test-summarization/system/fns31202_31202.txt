$52bn global market: 
this is defined as the geotechnical contracting market within the 
construction industry. it includes china, japan, korea and russia 
– markets where we don’t operate. road traffic accident
we were devastated after a serious road accident in july 
of 2017, near machadodorp, south africa, left 18 of our 
franki africa employees dead and a number seriously injured. we provided care and support to those directly impacted and 
trauma counselling was made available for the families of the 
deceased and injured as well as for colleagues. practical and 
financial arrangements were also made to assist families to 
travel from their homes around south africa to the various 
hospitals where the deceased and injured had been taken. we also advanced financial support for funeral costs and other 
expenses and provided assistance to families and victims to 
claim benefits from pension and insurance providers. we are the world’s largest 
geotechnical solutions 
specialist. we have the financial strength, 
know-how, capacity and the 
global reach to tackle some 
of the largest and most 
demanding projects around 
the world. whatever the size of the 
project, we have the people, 
expertise, experience and 
financial stability to respond 
quickly with the optimum 
solution, execute safely 
and see it through to 
a successful conclusion. we have a stable business model with a long-term track record 
of growth and value creation. underlying operating profit was £108.7m, an increase of 14% 
on the £95.3m generated in 2016. on a constant currency basis 
underlying operating profit was up 10%. the group underlying 
operating margin decreased from 5.4% to 5.2%, mainly due to 
lower margins in north america offset by improved profitability 
in emea. the underlying effective tax rate 
decreased from 35.0% in 2016 to 25.0% in 2017, mainly due to 
a £9.7m credit for the revaluation of us deferred tax liabilities 
following the recent us tax reforms. on a constant currency 
basis, underlying earnings per share were up 30%. overview

global market trends offer 
positive opportunities for 
keller because we excel in 
sophisticated geotechnical 
solutions. why this is good for keller
with our world-leading geotechnical engineering team, our near 
shore marine capable businesses (waterway and austral) and 
the breadth of our product base we are able to cope with the 
most complex challenges when working on brownfield/marginal 
land sites. why this is good for keller
keller has a strong history of technology development, 
leveraging our in-house equipment manufacturing team in 
germany as well as in hayward baker and bencor in the usa 
to develop market-leading data acquisition systems. used alone or in combination, 
our techniques solve a wide 
range of geotechnical 
challenges across the entire 
construction spectrum. our projects are 
typically for a single, local 
site, perhaps for a building, 
a basement or a bridge. we operate in the large and growing global construction 
and infrastructure market. we still have many areas for improvement and a strategy 
to deliver the benefits. the specialist geotechnical contracting sub-sector has higher 
margins and favourable market trends. our group strategy is 
designed to capitalise on 
these trends and our kpis 
measure our progress in 
doing so. market demand trends 1. urbanisation and more large-
scale development projects 
this holds for almost all geographies. it is driving growth and 
increased complexity in the market. niche sub-sector:
geotechnical solutions are a small, niche sub-sector of 
construction. all of these 
operations require more sophisticated geotechnical techniques. given the loads 
involved in transport and energy infrastructure the geotechnical 
solution is often sophisticated and large-scale. in cramped 
metropolitan environments new infrastructure typically replaces 
old in-situ, adding complexity to the solution.
