return on capital employed increased by 2.2 percentage points during the year, from 17 .1% 
to 19.3%. headline operating profit increased by 24.4% from £99.6m to £123.9m, while average 
capital employed increased by 10.3% to £642.5m. the surface is hardened via a 
specialised nitriding process 
during which nitrogen is diffused 
into the surface to increase 
resistance to in-service stress 
and fatigue. after heat treatment, the 
masking is removed and 
the surface cleaned 
before inspection to 
ensure the part meets 
strict aerospace quality 
specifications. our bones, effectively composites, absorb such stresses 
regularly and effectively for much of our lifetime. these implants must be incredibly strong, 
biocompatible, and able to last the lifetime of the patient. throughout this report you will see illustrations which link our business and strategy:
