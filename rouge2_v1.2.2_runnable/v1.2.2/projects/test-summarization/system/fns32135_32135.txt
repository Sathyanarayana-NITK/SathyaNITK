 like for like sales are for the 52 weeks ended 25 march 2017 and exclude the stable. as ever, we 
have delivered excellent returns for our shareholders and over 
the last five years, our eps has risen 56%. our managed pubs and hotels have had another very strong 
year, with like for like sales rising by 3.7%, outperforming  
the market once again. food sales have grown ahead of this 
rate, while our accommodation business has performed 
exceptionally well, with a rise in occupancy rates increasing 
like for like sales by 6.4%. this year, our new cross-flow filter became fully 
operational. the tenanted inns division has had a year of consolidation 
while we reviewed our strategy. we have a clear vision of 
where we can add value to the tenanted partnership and  
how to build solid foundations for future growth. it is the route by which 
we recruit, develop and inspire our teams. 2

 operating profit before separately disclosed items. this means 
that the beer in our kegs, bottles and cans tastes 
better for longer – surely a good thing in anyone’s 
brewing book. it works by first centrifuging the 
beer to remove the yeast and then forcing the 
beer at high pressure through membranes with 
very tiny holes, which are only 0.65 microns wide. the fuller’s beer company continues to produce an 
interesting and award-winning range of beers and ciders  
and brands such as frontier, our delicious craft lager, have 
grown sales and taken fuller’s into new listings. a chef who has seen 
a fish smoked, a cow milked or an ice-cream 
churned has a better appreciation of the flavours 
in, and the passion behind our ingredients. pa s si on

quality. w
hile we have always had fantastic brewers at 
fuller’s, we take great pride in the nuts and 
bolts of the brewery too. during the year, we appointed simon dodd, who used to  
run the premium city pubs for fuller’s inns, to the role of 
managing director of the fuller’s beer company. in another personnel change, john keeling will be spending 
more time in a beer ambassador role, promoting fuller’s both 
in the uk and globally and i am delighted that he has handed 
the head brewer baton to georgina young, who he has 
mentored and developed since she joined us in 1999.
