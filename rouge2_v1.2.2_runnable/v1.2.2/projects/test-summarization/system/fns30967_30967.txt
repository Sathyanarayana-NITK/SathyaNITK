we ensure that the group is managed in accordance with the uk corporate 
governance code as far as is reasonably practicable, although it is not a requirement 
for an aim quoted company. the board believes that effective corporate governance 
will assist in the delivery of sustainable shareholder value and safe-guard shareholders’ 
long-term interests. we have an internal team working with advisors to identify, appraise 
and progress acquisition opportunities. with its footprint in mainland europe, the group is well 
positioned to deal with the uncertain outcome of the uk negotiations 
with the eu, moving activities into jurisdictions that are beneficial to 
the business. 3

our range of medical adhesives, based on cyanoacrylate. it excludes negative 
pressure wound therapy (npwt). they are designed 
to meet the requirements of the clinician and to treat the full 
spectrum of wounds that they need to close and protect. this accurate laparoscopic 
application of adhesive is expected to both reduce surgical 
complications and reduce the potential pain associated with the use 
of tacks and staples. it also provides the ability to attach mesh in areas 
where tacks and staples cannot be applied, helping to improve the 
patient experience and surgical outcomes. we expect to file for european approval in the second half of 2018.
