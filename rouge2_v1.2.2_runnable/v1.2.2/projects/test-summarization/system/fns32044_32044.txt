face within this fluid and hostile environment. ncc group is passionate about changing the 
shape of the internet to make it safer and

think about cyber security. secondly, to assess 
the relative strengths and weaknesses 
of ncc group in the market. the review also confirmed the current 
financial logic of the relationship between 
assurance and escrow. visit us online at

current trading and outlook 
all businesses go through transitional 
phases as they grow and mature. firstly, to develop a better understanding 
of our marketplace, our competitors 
and our customers. the review confirmed that our markets 
remain attractive and, more importantly, 
that customers regard ncc group as a 
very strong competitor in these markets 
with a strongly differentiated proposition. the strong cyber security theme (or 
“golden thread”) that runs through the 
assurance division represents a unique 
set of competencies and capabilities 
that we can leverage to deliver greater 
customer value in a highly complex and 
fragmented market. in 
part, this was prompted by a combination 
of shareholder and employee feedback. business performance has fallen short 
of expectations, we have outgrown some 
of our business processes and controls, 
and we have experienced significant 
changes to our board. strong value creation will result if we 
effectively implement our new strategy 
and successfully manage ncc group 
through the transitional period in which 
we now find ourselves. we still enjoy significant organic 
growth in our core markets and have 
a strong balance sheet. furthermore, 
in a constantly evolving and complex 
market, our unique market leading skills 
and capabilities are keeping us at the 
forefront of thought leadership. despite 
delivering revenue growth of almost 
£35.4m (up 17 per cent), adjusted* ebit 
went backwards to £27 .5m from £39.7m 
in the prior year. operating profit fell 
from £1 1.4m in the prior year to a loss 
of £53.4m. in terms of trading for the current 
financial year, the board expects 
escrow to return to low single digit 
revenue growth and see some margin 
improvement. the assurance business is 
expected to see high single-digit organic 
revenue growth as we build from the 
low point of the second half of last year. 25546.04    9 august 2017 3:58 pm    proof six

introduction 
my first statement to shareholders as 
executive chairman reflects on two 
strong but contradictory themes. strategic review and 
strategic plan
following the trading update on  
21 february 2017 , the board 
commissioned a strategic review. only by doing 
this will we be able to 
capture the significant 
value available to us

finally, the review identified two of the 
smaller assurance businesses that sit 
outside the cyber golden thread whose 
future would be better served under 
alternative ownership. a project is also 
underway to put all of our internal and 
external monitoring services on to the 
“ctmp” platform acquired with fox-it. flaws 
in code can prevent software from 
operating at optimum levels and spikes 
in online traffic can throw websites 
offline. psc is a leading provider of cyber security, payment  
and compliance-related consulting services to the global 
payments industry. vsr is an information, network and application security 
consultancy. firstly, 
the past year has been very challenging, 
both operationally and financially. equally, and more importantly, it is 
already clear that the years ahead 
present significant upside opportunities. this outcome reflected a 
number of historical weaknesses in our 
operating model. in the next 12 to 24 months, we intend 
to focus more of our efforts on internal 
self-help measures than has been the 
case historically. our business performance is shown in 
more detail in the strategic report on 
pages 16 to 57 . a short summary of the activities of each is set out below and on the following pages. see 
page 21 for more detail. see page 21 for more detail.
