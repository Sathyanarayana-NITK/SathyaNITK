success of project spring we continue to invest 
in network quality and customer experience, 
driving subscriber growth across mobile,

good progress in converged

europe remains our single biggest market

of our “gigabit vodafone” converged

we are among the top five internet  
providers and one of the world’s largest 
operators of submarine cables. 11 8
countries with 4g roaming coverage 
our leading global 4g roaming footprint 
serves twice as many destinations 
as the best local competitor in most 
of our markets. all amounts marked with an “*” represent organic growth which 
presents performance on a comparable basis, both in terms 
of merger and acquisition activity and movements in foreign 
exchange rates. organic growth is an alternative performance 
measure. the launch 
of free services by a new entrant has disrupted 
an already hypercompetitive market and 
clouded the near and medium-term outlook 
for the industry. as a consequence vodafone 
decided to stop the ipo process and instead 
look for in-market consolidation options. in 2016, only 3% of italian fixed broadband subscribers were on  
fibre and in 2015 60% of the population received less than 30 mbps. 5%

notes:
2 common functions includes revenue from services 
provided centrally or offered outside our operating 
company footprint, including some markets where 
we have a licensed network operation, for example 
offering ip-vpn services in singapore. plus a review of our performance against our goals and our approach 
to running a sustainable business. india still remains part of the group 
from an operational perspective. we are making good 
progress in our major markets, germany, italy 
and spain, while in the uk our priority, for the 
moment, has to be on getting the basics right 
again. the completion of our merger in the 
netherlands with ziggo is another big step 
forward for our convergence strategy. this confidence is reflected in our unchanged 
intention to grow the dividend, as exhibited 
by the 2.0% increase in the dividend to  
14.77 eurocents for the year. this is being driven by rising living 
standards and population growth, combined 
with lower airtime and device costs. according to ovum, fixed 
broadband will be the fastest-growing market, 
with revenues increasing at a compound 
annual rate of 3.1% from 2016 to 2021, ahead 
of pay tv at 2.5% and mobile at 1.9%. we will own 45.1%, the adityla birla 
group 26.0% and idea’s current minority 
shareholders will own the remaining 28.9%. on 20 march 201 7 we announced 
an agreement to merge vodafone india 
with idea cellular in india, as a result 
vodafone india is now excluded from 
group figures unless otherwise stated. our “sustainable business strategy” section 
outlines our approach, including our ambition 
to connect an additional 50 million women 
living in emerging markets by 2026 (see 
pages 26 and 27), as well as our commitment 
to operating responsibly. in concluding, on behalf of the board i would 
like to express our appreciation to nick land 
and phil y ea, who will not seek re-election at our 
annual general meeting in july 201 7 after 
more than ten years of valuable service. t oday, 31 million customers in ten countries rely  
on our service, making us the world’s leading mobile money provider, 
alleviating financial uncertainty and contributing to achieving the 
un sustainable development goals. 8 december 2016. connecting
