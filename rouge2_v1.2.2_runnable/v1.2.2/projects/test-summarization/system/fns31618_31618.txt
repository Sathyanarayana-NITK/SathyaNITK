1	 we	have	identified	successful	execution	of	the	tag	programme	as	a	principal	risk	(see	page	52). both	of	
these	measures	reflect	event	timing	
differences	and	are	after	incurring	costs	
associated	with	the	tag	programme	
within	headline	results,	in	relation	to	the	
delivery	of	the	group’s	new	strategy. we	hire	exhibition	space	from	local	venue	
owners	and	generate	our	revenues	
primarily	from	the	sale	of	exhibition	
space	at	our	events,	charging	exhibitors	
by	the	square	metre	for	space	sold. data	is	not	currently	
available	to	report	performance	against	
all	of	these	kpis	–	this	will	come	with	
the	full	implementation	of	tag	and	
the	roll-out	of	the	new	global	crm	and	
finance	systems	–	but	a	number	of	these	
measures	are	already	being	reported	
against	internally. included	within	headline	
profits	were	£2.8m	of	costs	associated	
with	the	tag	programme,	such	as	the	
best	practice	teams	and	the	impact	of	
changes	to	the	sales	commission	structure. ite is well placed to realise its vision of creating the 
world’s leading portfolio of content-driven, must-attend 
events that deliver an outstanding experience and roi 
for our customers. we	remain	focussed	
on	implementing	robust	processes	that	
identify	and	mitigate	risk	and	deliver	best	
practice	in	the	context	of	delivering	on	
our	promises	to	all	of	our	stakeholders. to	deliver	our	vision,	tag	is	being	
implemented	across	the	group	and	
comprises	three	pillars:
–	 create	a	scalable	platform	to	generate	
real	organic	growth;
–	 actively	managing	our	portfolio;	and
–	 make	selective	product-led	acquisitions. as	part	of	our	tag	programme	we	are	
investing	up	to	£20m	across	the	next	
three	years,	which,	underpinned	by	a	
performance-led	culture,	will	accelerate	
organic	revenue	growth	as	follows:
create a scalable platform
transformational	levers	and	tag	
investment	will	be	spread	across	five	
areas to:
–	 create best practice functions 
and teams
• deliver	best-in-class	processes	
implemented	globally	across	the	
group,	greater	efficiency	via	
standardised	processes,	a	more	
structured	and	accountable	
leadership,	and	a	globally	consistent	
‘ite	way’	driving	efficiency	and	
greater	attendee	experience. our	international	sales	structures	have	
been	repositioned	to	focus	on	our	
core	market-leading	events	and	this	
has	seen	strong	revenue	growth	which	
has	offset	the	cancellation	of	smaller,	
non-core,	low	yielding	events. this	has	led	
to	monthly	sales	league	tables	which	are	
continually	reviewed	and	has	enhanced	
visibility. new	technology	also	enables	organisers	
to	drive	retention	since	improving	events	
drives	increases	in	retention	rates	for	
exhibitors	and	increases	in	visitor	numbers. outlook
whilst	we	continue	to	roll	out	the	tag	
programme	across	our	core	events,	we	
remain	focussed	on	trading	performance. with	the	current	
lower	levels	of	group	profit	and	the	
tag	programme	investment	the	board	
believes	this	to	be	in	the	long-term	
interests	of	shareholders. neil england

philosophies
ite’s	approach	is	based	on	a	view	
of	what	our	customers	want	–	and	
to	be	clear,	customers	include	both	
exhibitors	and	visitors. 3	 like-for-like	results	are	stated	on	a	constant	currency	basis,	after	excluding	events	which	took	place	in	the	current	period	but	did	not	take	place	under	our	ownership	in	the	
comparative	period	and	after	excluding	events	which	took	place	in	the	comparative	period	but	did	not	take	place	under	our	ownership	in	the	current	period. 5	 core	events	are	those	of	strategic	importance	to	our	future	and	include	the	group’s	largest	events,	those	with	the	greatest	potential	for	growth	and	a	number	of	smaller	but	
strategically	important	events. following	the	strategic	review,	the	group	deliberately	segmented	its	business	into	core	and	non-core,	enabling	management	to	increase	its	focus	
on	events	that	present	the	greatest	opportunities	whilst	reducing	distraction	from	smaller	events. this growth in part reflects 
the successful roll out of the first phase of our tag 
initiatives and our decision to focus on core events 
that have the greatest capacity for growth. ite group plc  annual report and accounts 2017

that we believe will lead to success. a new vision for ite
this	was	mark	shashoua’s	first	full	year	as	
chief	executive	officer	and	andrew	beach	
joined	early	in	the	year	as	chief	financial	
officer. the	new	executive	team	and	the	
board	have	undertaken	a	full	strategic	
review	of	the	business	to	identify	the	
optimum	way	forward	for	the	group. this	
review	involved	a	number	of	specialist	
advisors	working	together	with	the	senior	
management	team,	covering	every	aspect	
of	the	business	and	the	recommendations	
were	carefully	considered	by	the	board. this	will	involve	
significant	investment	in	event	content	
and	marketing	with	the	intention	to	make	
our	leading	shows	‘must-visit’	events	
in	their	market	sectors. the	group	has	
also	adopted	a	new	‘sales-led’	culture	
to drive revenue and has invested in a 
central	best	practice	team	to	ensure	that	
the	group	is	consistent	in	delivering	a	
high-quality	experience	for	exhibitors	
and	visitors	alike	anywhere	in	the	world. our people
ite	is	a	business	whose	success	is	
dependent	on	the	hard	work	and	loyalty

throughout	the	world,	regardless	of	
location.
