the positive news flow across the year on 
new business wins was crowned by the 
announcement in late october of the award 
of a €18m contract with ohb system ag 
to deliver the ground station control and

welcome the uk government’s strong support 
for the uk’s continued participation in eu-
funded space programmes (egnos, galileo

on this position during the negotiations for 
the transition-stage arrangements, we are 
nevertheless preparing a range of tactical 
options (including the option of re-domiciling, 
while retaining our aim listing and associated 
uk tax benefits) to mitigate the possible 
effects of brexit on our space business post-
march 2019 should negotiations not prove 
favourable. testament to these

earlier optimism justified 
in my report for 2016, i advised that, given the 
strength of our then current order book and 
short-term pipeline, we anticipated that the 
growth we were seeing would continue into 
at least the first half of 2017. we also noted 
that, in keeping with the pattern over previous 
years, we anticipated that our second half-
year financial performance in 2017 would be 
substantially stronger than the first half. the group delivered a strong 
overall performance in 2017, with results for 
full-year revenues and adjusted profits being 
comfortably in line with guidance. going into 2018 the outlook continues to be 
very encouraging. we develop robust, real-world application solutions and products and provide 
supporting services that create real business benefit to a wide range of 
customers in diverse markets. innovative. growing. this was, indeed, the case and i am pleased 
to report that our optimism and guidance was 
well placed.
