achievements
 the first kraken oil cargo 
was lifted from the fpso in 
september. • workshops held at dnv gl’s spadeadam 
testing and research centre to maintain and 
improve major accident hazard awareness
• learning culture and sharing of best practice 
enabled continuous improvements to the 
kraken drilling programme which was c.300 days 
ahead of schedule in 2017

longest open hole interval gravel packed with 
optipac screens
• improving safety systems, asset integrity and 
equipment reliability by upgrading and replacing 
obsolete components at thistle and pm8/seligi

modern seismic; reactivation of the old drill rig and drilling

gross production increased from 2,000 boepd levels to 
between 14,000 and 16,000 boepd by the last quarter of 
2015 and improved production efficiency; unit operating 
costs substantially down, from over $100/bbl to below  
$30/bbl; bringing scolty/crathes onstream extends the life

quickly increased gross production from 12,400 boepd to 
15,100 boepd; production efficiency has been enhanced 
and maintained at high levels. group production of 37,405 boepd in 2017 
was disappointing, primarily caused by 
performance issues at alma/galia and 
lower than planned production from both 
kraken and scolty/crathes. key risks for 2018
• a materially lower than expected production 
performance at the kraken field
• unexpected shutdowns on producing assets

enquest plc  annual report 2017
this strategic report 
includes details of enquest’s 
strategy, business model, 
capabilities, values,  
long-term track record  
and key risks. the final phases of  
alma/galia optimisation 
projects for power, 
produced water and sea 
water injection were 
completed, leading to 
increased production 
uptimes. the second kraken 
production processing train 
was brought onstream in 
november, assisting in 
delivering gross production 
rates of over 40,000 bopd. across 2017, the group’s 
strong focus on hse&a led 
to a significant improvement 
in the recordable incident 
frequency rate and 12 
months without a reportable 
hydrocarbon release in the 
north sea business. in the greater kittiwake 
area, the mallard/gadwall 
water injection flowline 
replacement was completed 
and brought into service. at the start of december, 
enquest completed its 
acquisition of the magnus 
oil field and sullom voe oil 
terminal, becoming the 
operator of both. in february, the kraken 
floating production, 
storage and offloading 
(‘fpso’) vessel arrived in the 
field and was securely 
moored on station. the alma/galia fpso was 
brought back onstream 
following unscheduled 
outages caused by winter 
storm damage. excellent drilling progress 
was made at kraken with the 
completion of the first and 
second drill centre (‘dc’) 
programmes, delivering 
seven producer and six 
injector wells, followed by 
drilling at dc3. the well completions 
included the world’s longest 
open hole interval gravel 
packed with optipac 
screens (4,347ft). in occupational 
safety, our lost time incident (‘lti’) 
performance remained strong, with 
many assets recording an lti-free year. in july 2017, dr philip nolan stepped down 
from his role as non-executive director, 
having joined the board in 2012. i thank 
philip for his valuable contribution to the 
company, especially in its development 
over the past five years. 2 ebitda is calculated on a business performance basis, and is calculated by taking profit/(loss) from operations before tax and 
finance income/(costs) and adding back depletion, depreciation, foreign exchange movements and the realised gain/(loss) on 
foreign currency derivatives related to capital expenditure. kraken crude oil quality was 
well received by buyers, as 
reflected in the sale of some 
spot cargos at a discount to 
brent of less than $5/bbl. in early 2018, enquest 
agreed renegotiated terms 
for the transocean leader 
drilling rig, reducing both 
the contract duration  
and day rates, saving 
c.$60 million of net cash 
payments for capital 
expenditure in 2019. kraken 
full cycle gross project 
capital expenditure has 
been further reduced and is 
now expected to be c.$2.3 
billion, more than 25% lower 
than originally sanctioned. in january, enquest 
announced an agreement to 
acquire an initial 25% 
interest in the magnus oil 
field and a 3.0% interest in 
the sullom voe oil terminal 
from bp via an innovative 
transaction structure. a compression reliability 
improvement programme 
was completed on  
pm8/seligi, underpinning 
delivery of production 
volumes. kraken’s full cycle gross 
project capital expenditure 
estimate was reduced 
during 2017, reflecting the 
earlier than expected 
completion of dc3 and 
lower market rates for the 
remaining subsea campaign. 04
