results 
the board is pleased to announce strong results for the year 
ended 30 september 2017. these results reflect our position 
as a leading provider of engineering services to many of the 
uk’s critical infrastructure assets and in particular our 
strength in the nuclear, rail and water markets. the board 
determined that a non-cash impairment charge of £5.8m 
should be made which is included within exceptional items. in specialist building, the group focuses on the high quality 
residential market in london and the home counties where 
we have particular skills in major engineering structural works 
to extend or reconfigure high value properties. we are strategically placed on all three lots of 
the ten-year decommissioning delivery partnership 
framework that has an estimated value of £500m with the 
headroom to increase to £1.5bn over the term to 2025. our 
long-term engagement on high priority programmes provides 
good visibility and we remain strongly positioned for 
participation in future major project programmes at the site. in the period we were appointed as sole supplier on the 
national seven-year meica framework for canal and river 
trust which will see us support around 1,000 water assets for 
this new client. these positions are complemented by projects 
for repeat clients and 2017 has seen another major remediation 
contract successfully carried out for glasgow city council. during the year 
we worked on over 5,000 individual remits with an average 
value of £11,000 as well as approximately 300 larger projects. p scott
