 solid financials
 
since 2009, we have grown 
our revenue from £9.1 million 
to £66.1 million. our ebitda has also 
realised significant growth from £1.3 
million to £13.1 million and we have 
been highly cash-generative over that 
period, with a closing net cash balance 
of £14.2 million (fy16: £5.6 million). in addition, all foreign exchange movements disclosed in revenue are excluded from both years. from this 
investment, we net a healthy balance 
of both new product introductions 
as well as next generations and 
enhancements of our core product base. since that starting point 28 years 
ago, the division has evolved 
to provide a spectrum of highly 
advanced technologically-
driven products. through 
product innovation we now offer 
the best value to a wide range 
of different market segments. our portfolio 
is used by both audio professionals 
and amateurs alike in order to 
enhance the creative process and 
realise the highest quality production 
of recorded and live sound. additionally, focusrite pro, led 
by our rednet line of enterprise level 
audio over internet protocol (‘aoip’) 
solutions continues to show widespread 
adoption in all professional audio 
facilities. with 
novation, we continue to shape the sound 
of electronic music today with market-
leading keyboard controllers, synthesisers 
and grid-based musical instruments. 4
