acquisition of danlind a/s
on 4 september 2017, the group announced the 
proposed acquisition of the entire share capital of 
danlind a/s, a supplier of auto dishwash and laundry 
products, based in denmark. danlind 
will enable mcbride to gain entry into growth segments 
where it is currently under-represented. mcbride expects to realise significant commercial, 
technical and operational improvement synergies 
from the acquisition. we offer tailored services aligned with specific 
customer and channel requirements, strengthening these relationships 
and leveraging our scale through a complete focus on improving our 
operational excellence and driving our cost competitiveness. regulatory environment
mcbride embraces initiatives to improve safety 
for the consumer. 3. 2. 1. 2. (3) adjustments were made for the amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items, non-cash financing costs from  
unwind of discount on initial recognition of contingent consideration; unwind of discount on provisions and any related tax. underlying 
revenues for the year were lower by 3.8% in constant 
currency terms, with a further 2.1% reduction a result of 
the deliberate action to simplify the customer portfolio. during the period of the 
‘repair’ phase, the payment was held at 3.6 pence per 
share, now that we have exited this phase and in light 
of the improved financial performance of the company, 
the board will recommend to increase the payment to 
shareholders to 4.3 pence per share. this represents a 
19% increase and brings the payment in line with our 
policy of a dividend cover range of 2x-3x, taking into 
account funding availability. danlind has a significant 
range of retail and contract customers along with a 
well-established position in the nordic region and in 
the commercial laundry and dishwash markets. additionally, 
danlind’s strong position in ecolabel products can 
be developed further through mcbride’s extensive 
european reach. brand owners
brand owners often use private label suppliers to 
co-manufacture their products, however, recently 
an increase in the demand for longer-term, more 
structural arrangements is emerging. for mcbride, 
this is not different from direct supply to major 
retail customers, while assisting in maximisation 
of asset utilisation. for more information visit

products segment. results
the past year has demonstrated further progress in 
the quality of the group’s profits and a step closer to 
our medium-term profitability ambitions. the company develops 
and manufactures products 
for the majority of retailers 
and major brand owners 
throughout the uk, europe 
and asia. headquartered 
in manchester, uk, mcbride 
operates across 12 countries, 
with 17 manufacturing facilities 
producing over 1.1 billion units 
a year and employs 4,100 
employees globally. we are the private label experts in our segments with the scale 
to offer our development and manufacturing capabilities to 
customers in the uk, continental europe and the asia pacific. danlind operates from three manufacturing sites in 
denmark, and has approximately 250 employees. a business active in a change 
programme whilst delivering 
a progressively more 
sustainable financial position. the business has delivered another strong year of 
progress towards our medium-term ambitions and 
progressed extensively in the first months of the 
‘prepare’ phase of the ‘repair, prepare, grow’ strategy. this report demonstrates a business active in a change 
programme whilst delivering a progressively more 
sustainable financial position. strategic progress
we outlined at the interim stage that the group was 
closing out the ‘repair’ phase of the transformation 
strategy. danlind provides 
mcbride with access to accelerated growth in the key 
strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through 
its well-invested capacity, technology platform and 
high quality product range. these include key activities 
in the development of the sales growth plan, covering 
both organic development and possible acquisition 
opportunities in markets and categories. support 
actions for this growth have been developed, including 
in particular the capital expenditure required to ensure 
our manufacturing platform is to the capacity and 
standard required. with raw 
material pressures in the second half and market 
conditions meaning wholesale price increases are 
not feasible; the business has delivered savings from 
product engineering and further reductions across all 
cost categories.
