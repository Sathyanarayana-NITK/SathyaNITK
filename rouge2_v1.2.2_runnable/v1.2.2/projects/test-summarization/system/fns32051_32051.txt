the group and the controls in place to mitigate any 
potential adverse impacts. this reflects strong growth

focused growth strategy. our financial kpis:

across channels and profit growth at a faster rate than sales growth, whilst delivering a strong return on our capital 
investments. our commercial and buying activity;

revenue by channel excludes shows and licencing. at the same time we are challenging 
ourselves to explore new growth opportunities, find 
new ways to delight our customers and operate ever 
more efficiently. the internet and new consumer technologies are 
changing the retail environment in exciting ways and 
creating new opportunities for brands and retailers. joules now has more, and better, methods than 
ever before to engage and connect with its growing 
community of customers. at the same time, customers’ 
expectations of brands are changing and the requirement 
to provide a seamless and satisfying experience across 
all channels at all times has never been more important.
