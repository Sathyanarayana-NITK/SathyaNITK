strategic report
2017 has been a year of heightened global 
and political uncertainty and prospects of 
continued volatility across markets. the expectation of rising interest rates in 
the uk in the near term appears increasingly 
likely. despite this, interest rates remain 
exceptionally	low	by	historic	standards	and	
the outlook for longer‑term rates remains 
benign, suggesting that the search for yield 
is likely	to	endure	as	a	key	investment	theme. annual report 2017 10
economy
economic and political uncertainty have 
become commonplace. the full year dividend 
reflects a pay-out ratio of 94.5 per cent 
of underlying earnings, delivering on our 
strategic priority of distributing superior 
income returns which are fully covered 
by underlying earnings and aligned with 
operating cash flow. our initial earnings target of 2.7 to 2.8 pence 
per share has been achieved and in only six 
months we have made material progress in 
improving the quality of the portfolio so as to 
deliver long‑term sustainable income returns 
and enhanced growth prospects. the completion	of	these	two	transactions	will	
result in the group’s overall interest in ihl 
increasing	to	58.9	per	cent. the acquisition 
is expected to provide a yield on equity of over 
10	per	cent	which	will	be	earnings	enhancing	
and provide exposure to assets demonstrating 
strong trading performance. i am therefore pleased to report 
another solid set of results, with underlying 
earnings per share at 2.75 pence, in line with 
recent guidance and epra nav per share up 
3.5 per cent to 41.4 pence. results and dividend
underlying earnings increased by 7.6 per 
cent to £49.8 million (2016: £46.3 million). underlying earnings per share are in line with 
guidance at 2.75 pence and form the base 
from which we will grow income in line with 
our medium‑term growth target of 3.0 to 
5.0 per cent per annum. epra nav increased by 3.5 per cent to 
41.4 pence per share (2016: 40.0 pence per 
share) supported by a 3.0 per cent like‑for‑like 
increase in the value of the group’s portfolio. redefine international is a diversified

in february 2017 we held an inaugural capital 
markets day and set out the company’s 
strategic priorities which have the goal of 
delivering superior, sustainable and growing 
income returns. following a period of 
significant growth and transactional activity 
these priorities underline our ongoing 
ambition to become the uk’s leading  
income focused reit. financial discipline 
in	february	2017,	we	aligned	underlying	
earnings	to	the	epra	measure,	adjusted	
for	limited	company	specific	non‑cash	
adjustments. scalable business
there are a number of long-term benefits 
associated with greater scale, including greater 
access to capital markets and liquidity, a lower 
cost of capital, overhead efficiencies and 
operational flexibility. equally,	we	look	to	recycle	
capital from assets providing limited further 
rental	and/or	capital	growth	expectations,	
where	business	plans	have	been	successfully	
executed and value creation maximised. with	growing	global	
appetite for predictable income returns, 
we believe	our	income‑led	strategy	to	deliver	
market leading shareholder distributions 
remains extremely attractive. we are increasingly 
looking to invest in locations and sectors 
with	long‑term	structural	support	driven	by	
occupier demand, infrastructure investment 
and strong demographics. rdi reit p.l.c. changed its
