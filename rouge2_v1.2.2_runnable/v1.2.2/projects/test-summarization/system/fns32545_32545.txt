we have also 
enjoyed the upturn in the market, with 
the strong zinc and aluminium prices 
playing to our particular strengths. we expect to see the gdp growth of 
the nation translating into meaningful 
increases in metals and energy demand. fy2018: optimism and discipline
i am optimistic that the improvement 
in commodity markets we have 
experienced this year may be with 
us for the foreseeable future. this 
year, markets have seen an upturn driven by 
improved demand and supply side constraints, 
which has benefited the commodities sector, 
particularly zinc, and we expect to see a 
continuing upward trend going forward. an important milestone for us this 
year was the completion of the 
merger of vedanta limited and 
cairn india, and our simplified 
group structure will support 
strong shareholder returns. 2 under care and maintenance. entrepreneurship
at vedanta, our people are our most 
important assets. during the year, we initiated a 
us$30 million investment fund for 
in-house r&d, supporting our wealth 
of knowledge and spirit of innovation 
with meaningful resources. stronger

with a significant amount of our capital 
investment programme completed, we are 
now ramping up and have commenced reaping 
benefits of those investments. since our listing in 2003, our assets have 
delivered 16% annualised growth in copper 
equivalent terms. three key characteristics of vedanta 
emerged from the year. first, we are stronger. second, we are working smarter. i also deeply regret that the year saw 
seven fatalities in the course of our 
operations.
