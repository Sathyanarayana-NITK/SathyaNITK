by their nature, forward-looking statements  
are inherently predictive and speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the 
future. you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject to factors 
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. pervasive cyber security threats 
cyberattacks are a global threat. a natural 
consequence is a reduction in expenditure 
as we cease or scale back activities outside
