chairman’s statement
as chairman of stock spirits group plc, i am pleased to present our 
annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 december 2017.
after a year of great change in 2016, the group 
entered 2017 with a significantly strengthened and 
experienced board and executive team who have a 
strong commitment to turning round the fortunes 
of the business. a comprehensive review of the group’s strategy 
was carried out in the latter half of the year. the 
chief conclusion from this process was that our 
strategy as outlined at the time of the ipo remains 
as relevant as ever. mirek will 
cover the detail of our conclusions and plans more 
thoroughly in his chief executive’s report. he does not intend to seek re-
election at the forthcoming agm. all board committee compositions are fully 
compliant with the corporate governance code. having a centralised procurement team 
results in significant purchasing power. comprehensive qualitative and quantitative multi-market consumer 
research was conducted to determine the optimal liquid and brand 
proposition to achieve this. the narrative in the annual report & accounts 
includes these alternative measures and an explanation is set out in note 7 to the 
consolidated financial statements included in the annual report & accounts

own italian brandy in 1884. 
throughout its history, stock 84 has been available in 24 countries across 
the world, with variations to its range, packaging and branding over time. the coverage factor is derived from the historical difference between

09 the performance of spirits in our markets, as 
in any other geography, is linked to shifts in 
demographics, fluctuations in the performance 
of local economies with the associated impact on 
consumer confidence and disposable income, plus 
the regulatory environment. a number of positive underlying macro consumer 
trends, outlined in more detail below, are 
anticipated to contribute to spirits value growth 
in our markets. stock spirits conducted exhaustive market research to ensure the redesign 
was in line with consumers’ high expectations for stock 84, working with 
leading italian design agencies on the redesign project. 2017 was a year of stabilisation for 
stock spirits, embedding the significant changes 
accomplished in 2016 whilst continuing to address 
the competitive challenges that remain in our 
markets, particularly that of our largest market, 
poland. we believe we have stabilised in this market 
and the local management team continues to drive 
through change and improvements. while the board’s major focus remained on 
returning our polish business to growth, we also 
considered the group’s future wider priorities. this redesign brings a renewed consistency to the product range globally, 
whilst giving it a fresher and more modern look. the new bottle 
stays faithful to the traditional stock 84 silhouette, but with a modern 
twist that adds a premium feel. they seek spirits from trustworthy brands of 
better and more consistent quality than they were 
able to purchase historically. this can be through a 
desire to display their own success, expertise, values 
or lifestyle through their choice of brands, but the 
behaviour can also be driven by the desire to retain 
accessible everyday luxuries when economic times 
are challenging.
