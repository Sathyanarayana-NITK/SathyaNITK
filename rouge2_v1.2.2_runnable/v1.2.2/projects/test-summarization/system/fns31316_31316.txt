another year of strong trading activity contributing 
to continued growth across the business. this now includes a total 
portfolio of over 420,000 smart domestic meters. the value of this approach can be seen in the 
last year as sms has performed strongly – deploying more 
capital and generating more incremental annualised 
recurring revenue than in the two previous years combined. this long-term annualised and index-linked recurring 
revenue has increased by 38% during the year, driven by 
the management and systems capacity in which we have

what sets us apart? in november 2017, we refinanced the business, extending the 
term of our £280m revolving credit facility and completing 
a £150m equity placing, providing us with a strong financial 
platform to help our customers complete their domestic 
smart meter programmes. delivering our strategy
last year we strategically changed our operational delivery 
model to gain direct control over a large proportion of our 
installation capacity and the end-to-end it platform which 
underpins it. all prior year underlying results have been restated in accordance with this new approach. however, we are not complacent and continue to invest 
and rigorously challenge, evaluate and assess the risks within 
our business to ensure that we are doing everything possible 
to ensure the health and safety of all our stakeholders. it is therefore the board’s 
intention to present our underlying performance including 
this income. we hope this voluntary disclosure best allows 
our shareholders to understand the impact of this change. 2 recurring revenue refers to revenue generated by meter rental and data contracts. annualised recurring revenue refers to the revenue being generated at a point in time. 3 pre-exceptional ebitda and underlying pbt figures are presented under our revised 
approach to include other operating income. 4 underlying pbt is before exceptional items and intangible amortisation. our focus for 2018
increase asset portfolio and annualised 
recurring revenues, and ensure full life 
cycle asset management. our potential for 2019 and beyond
sms believes the uk energy market 
will undergo significant change in 
pursuit of cost and co2 reductions. this allows pub managers to view their 
half-hourly energy consumption profiles and receive 
consumption alerts. to fund our continued growth, we undertook an exercise 
to raise additional equity investment and refinance our 
debt facility in q4 2017. i am pleased to report that we 
successfully placed £150m of additional ordinary shares 
at the same time as refinancing our £280m debt facility 
in november 2017. at the balance sheet date, our net 
debt was therefore £36.5m, giving us a net debt to 
pre-exceptional ebitda ratio of 0.90 times. 2017 has been a year of 
investment in our business 
– building capacity to grow 
and deliver for our customers, 
particularly in the smart 
domestic rollout.”
