the board 
is recommending a final dividend of 5.6 
pence per share to shareholders on the 
register on 25 august 2017. this represents an increase in full year 
dividend of 5% and continues bloomsbury’s dividend growth each 
year for over 20 years. revenues in bloomsbury india grew 46% (30% at 
constant currencies) and the business made an operating profit 
for the first time. book sales grew by 18% year on year to £133.3 million, with digital 
sales, included in this total, increasing by 7% to £16.0 million. we are encouraged 
that digital resources revenues exceeded our expectation, growing 
by 50% year on year to £3.9 million. again 2013 and 2014 have been restated to reflect the change in treatment  
of internally generated intangible asset amortisation. other highlighted items in this period of £0.9 million are 
primarily as a result of the strategic restructuring of the us operation. including 
capital expenditure, during the year we invested an additional £1.5 
million of cash in bloomsbury 2020. 
another strategic priority for cash is the growth of our dividend. the group has a progressive dividend policy while aiming to keep 
dividend earnings cover in excess of two. the illustrated edition of harry potter 
and the chamber of secrets by j. k. rowling and illustrated by jim 
kay was a major international seller. ”

non-consumer division
the non-consumer division, consisting of academic & professional, 
special interest and content services, generated revenues of  
£57.2 million (2016: £57.3 million) and operating profit before 
highlighted items of £4.1 million (2016: £7.1 million). w e are well-placed for the coming year. bloomsbury children’s books is the first publisher in 50 years to win 
both the carnegie and greenaway medals at the same time. bloomsbury has built up a 
valuable portfolio of content and rights-based intellectual property assets. he has extensive experience of digital 
publishing and has led the development of pioneering online 
content databases, which will benefit the board as bloomsbury 2020 
is rolled out. bloomsbury’s books and content products help 
enrich the lives of millions of people of all ages. the advent of digital 
media has not replaced printed books. the past year was bloomsbury’s 30th and the 23rd year of listing on 
the london stock exchange. looking back to the time of the 1994 
listing, the proposition was to be a medium–sized independent 
publisher of works of the highest literary and commercial 
quality. although much has changed in publishing since then, 
bloomsbury remains true to its original publishing mission. early in 2016, we simplified the organisational structure.
