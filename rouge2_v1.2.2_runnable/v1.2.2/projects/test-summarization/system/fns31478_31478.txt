we are always striving to bring the latest 
innovation to our cinemas – not only 
through technology but through the 
design of our new and refurbished sites 
and retail offerings. i am pleased to report that these 
objectives were met during the year 
and we will continue with their 
implementation in the uk, row 
and us in the forthcoming year. we are focused on providing our 
customers with the best possible cinema experience, 
offering a variety of movies, as well as different 
formats using the latest technologies. our vision is 
always to be “the best place to watch a movie”. they are focused on ensuring that our 
customers receive the best experience 
from the very start of their cinema visit. learning, development and employee 
engagement are areas of which we are 
immensely proud. — strong row

 increased by 14.5% to £127.5m. refurbishment of older sites, investment 
in new technologies and diversification 
of retail offerings are a key focus for the 
cineworld brand. the enlarged group’s diverse 
geographic footprint will help to mitigate 
year on year volatility in the global 
cinema industry resulting from regional, 
economic, weather and movie 
performance variables and enable the 
group to diversify its movie offerings. we 
regularly review areas such as gender, 
diversity, health and safety and the 
environment and where appropriate 
improve our practices in those areas. we will focus on maximising 
cash flow to expand and refurbish 
our cinemas, while at the same time 
reducing borrowing levels and 
maintaining our well established 
dividend policy. adjusted profit before tax is used an internal measure by 
management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance 
from period to period. value for shareholders
the cash generative nature of our 
business underpins our business model. property market 
and development
the rate of new cinema openings is often dependent upon 
local market conditions. market maturity where a market is in the maturity continuum this impacts 
the level and trend of cinema admissions per capita. strategic report
