currency
the contribution of foreign currency gains to our overall 
return for the year was 6.0%, accounting for one-third 
of our overall return. our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.07%, 
compared with 1.01% in 2016, reflecting slightly higher 
staff costs. the success of this strategy can be seen in the performance of caledonia’s 
nav per share total return measured against the ftse all-share since 
1987 and a record of 50 years of increasing its annual dividends. 2.  net asset value (‘nav’) per share is a measure of the value of the company per share, calculated by dividing net assets by the number of shares in issue, adjusting for shares 
held by the employee share trust and for dilution by the exercise of share options and awards, detailed in note 16 of the financial statements. nav per share takes account 
of dividends on the ex-dividend date. 3.  nav total return is a measure showing how the nav per share has performed over a period of time, taking into account both capital returns and dividends paid to 
shareholders. we achieve this by investing in proven well-managed businesses that 
combine long term growth characteristics with an ability to deliver 
increasing levels of income. under the framework of iso 14001, cpi takes a structured approach to measure, improve 
and audit their environmental status on an ongoing basis. the main areas targeted for continual reduction arise from the use of solvents, energy 
consumption and waste generation. 0
the measures below are deemed appropriate to assess the underlying operating results and enhance the comparability and understanding of the financial performance of caledonia:
1. net assets provides a measure of the value of the company to shareholders and is taken from the ifrs group net assets. macro-economic factors, 
particularly the devaluation of sterling against most 
other currencies, produced a tail-wind for our portfolio, 
with currency gains contributing 6% of the 18% total 
return for the year. quoted equities

one of the consequences of investing in larger private 
equity investments is that, when sold, large capital sums 
are returned on an irregular basis as demonstrated by 
the £207m of cash on our balance sheet at the year end. dividend yield averaged from 1987

risk
our approach to risk stems from an understanding that 
shareholders’ capital is a precious commodity which 
we are not required to grow at an unsustainable rate. our aim is to grow net assets and dividends paid to shareholders 
over the long term, whilst managing risk to mitigate volatility of returns. our investments cover both listed and 
private markets in broadly equal proportions, a range of sectors and, 
in particular through our fund investments, a global reach. ‘ftse®’ is a trade mark of the london stock exchange group companies and is used by ftse 
international limited under licence. caledonia’s strategy of 
owning a balanced investment portfolio of both uk 
and overseas based companies and funds proved to be 
a sound hedge against what turned out to be a period 
of considerable volatility. calls 
outside the united kingdom will be charged at the applicable international 
rate. all four of the 
investment pools produced double digit returns. investment income for the year was £47.3m, a fall 
of £3.4m compared with the unusually high level of 
the previous year. we are both proud of this achievement and determined 
to extend the record for many years to come. chairman
