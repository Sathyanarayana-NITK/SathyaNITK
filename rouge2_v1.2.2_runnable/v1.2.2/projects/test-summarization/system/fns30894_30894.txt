positioning right 
our team’s new brand for this client 
helped the company to find a unique 
identity in the crowded uk high street 
restaurant scene. by building on the 
existing brand with contemporary, 
striking communications and a 
streamlined, focused menu, we were 
able to strengthen market position 
and increase footfall “beyond 
expectation” in the flagship restaurant. this 
incentivised customers to stay loyal to the 
brand, while also giving the company a highly 
useful buying habit measuring tool. • there will be a deliberate focus on margin improvement and 
related pricing initiatives. adjusted earnings per share is diluted and excludes the after tax effects of exceptional 
items, amortisation of acquired intangibles and certain tax items in respect of prior years. **  free cash flow represents net operating cash flow less net capital expenditure. this is reflected in our ability to earn an improved and 
sustainable margin. • hmrc (her majesty’s revenue and customs): good progress in 
the implementation of the contract for all outbound printed 
customer communication and forms fulfilment. the communisis team centralised 
procurement to control branding and create an

“ strong trading in 2017 saw communisis 
generating profitable growth with good 
levels of free cash flow and a significant 
reduction in net debt. • the target has now been built into in our senior management 
remuneration policy and the design of the 2018 long term 
incentive plans (ltips). following 
successful migration of all fulfilment activity to our newcastle 
operation in may 2017, communisis assumed full accountability 
for all printed customer communications with the transition of 
circa 180 million packs annually into our halifax and liverpool 
transactional facilities beginning in october 2017. • hong kong: communisis will open an office in hong kong in 
april 2018 for the sourcing of “premiums”; the gifts which 
accompany many purchases of luxury goods. a strategy for the group’s next 
phase of growth is being launched: a focused, 
three year plan to create enhanced returns to 
shareholders as we raise the value we provide 
to our clients.”
