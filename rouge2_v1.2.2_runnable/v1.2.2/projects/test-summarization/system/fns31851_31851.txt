of +9.2 per cent and even stronger growth in 
adjusted ebitda *** at +16.0 per cent against 
the restated figure for the prior period. last year’s 
adjusted ebitda*** has been restated from 
£15.6 million to £13.0 million. 2017  
continued operational progress 
attractive premium brands positioned for

driving service performance. operational priorities
 > consistently providing outstanding 
service and unbeatable quality 
to our customers. we currently trade from an estate of 69 bars located predominantly in town 
or city centre high streets. belfast 
revolución de cuba has 
achieved the highest sales 
levels of all venues opened 
in the last two years and has 
averaged £80k per week over 
the first nine full weeks of trading. three revolutions are scheduled 
to open in solihull, inverness and 
putney before christmas and two 
revolución de cubas are expected 
to open in the second half. new revolución de cubas at harrogate, aberdeen, reading and glasgow were 
opened in the first half of the period, and were followed by two new revolutions 
in southend and torquay in the final quarter. our bars focus on a premium drinks and food-led offering and typically trade 
from late morning through to late evening. > constantly innovating to ensure 
that we offer our customers a 
market-leading range of 
cocktails and spirits. > rollout of the brand in selective 
high street locations throughout 
the uk. > rollout of the brand in selective

strong national presence across the uk and significant growth opportunities. the 
new venue pipeline is building very 
strongly and contracts have already 
been exchanged on a further 
two sites to open in the following 
financial period. during the year, there was significant change 
within our finance team. the new team’s initial focus was to assess 
the forecast results for the current period. the company has an accounting reference date 30 june and prepares accounts to 
the saturday closest to this date. throughout this report references to “2016”, 
“fy16”, “year ended 30 june 2016” and “30 june 2016” relate to the 53 week period 
ended 2 july. when discussing performance in the period to 2 july 2016 when 
referring to the position at the end of period references to “2015”, “fy15”, “year 
ended 30 june 2015” and “30 june 2015” relate to the 52 week period ended 27 june 
2015 when discussing performance in the period and to 27 june 2015 when referring 
to the position at the end of the period. when discussing lfl metric the prior period 
comparison have been adjusted to reflect an equivalent 53 week period. we 
consider adjusted ebitda *** to be the key 
measure that best represents the business’ 
underlying performance as it excludes 
exceptional items and bar opening costs 
that are a function of the timing of the new 
venue development programme rather 
than the underlying trade. deltic has outlined a merger 
proposal, which the board has rejected due 
to significant concerns regarding both value 
and deliverability. stonegate will have the right to reduce 
the amount of consideration payable for 
each revolution share by the amount of 
any dividend (or other distribution) which 
is paid or becomes payable by revolution 
to revolution shareholders before the date on 
which the proposed scheme of arrangement 
becomes effective, which is expected to 
be on or about 23 october 2017. based 
on the expected timetable, therefore, it is 
not anticipated that any dividend (or other 
distribution) will be paid or that the offer 
price will be reduced. the sector is facing some well-publicised 
and significant cost headwinds: minimum 
wage and living wage rate increases, the 
introduction of the apprenticeship levy 
and substantial increases in general rates 
following the 2017 revaluation. *** adjusted ebitda excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the financial review). *** adjusted ebitda excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the financial review). *** adjusted ebitda excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the financial review). kpis 
the principal kpis for the strategy outlined 
above are as follows:
> like-for-like sales**;
> number of units;
> adjusted venue ebitda ***; and
> gross margins.
