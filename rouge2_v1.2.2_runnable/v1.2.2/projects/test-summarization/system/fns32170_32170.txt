strategic report governance financial statements additional information chairman’s statement
assura’s purpose is to provide 
gps and patients with the 
buildings they need today 
for the nhs of tomorrow. we have signed new 
unsecured debt facilities of £350 million, 
lowering the overall cost of borrowings 
by 78 basis points to 4.06%. last year we set a lower medium-term 
loan to value (“ltv”) target range of 
between 40% and 50%. our property portfolio expanded 
significantly, through both acquisitions 
and new developments. the increased scale of our operations 
and our strong financial position have 
assisted us in obtaining better terms 
on our debt. moreover, it provides a highly scalable 
model that means that, as we grow, 
the benefits of scale accrue to 
shareholders and drive our progressive 
dividend policy and shareholder returns. a key 
component of this return is a growing, 
covered dividend. we shall continue 
to monitor what the right ltv range 
is for the company. he had a clear vision, 
inspired investor confidence and built a 
strong team, all of which transformed 
assura into a leading player in the sector. we have 43 people employed in 
assura and, on behalf of the board, 
i would like to thank them all for their 
hard work, dedication and contribution 
to the success of the business through 
such a busy year. culture, values and ethics 
the nhs is assura’s prime customer, 
accounting for 86% of our total rent roll. in the past year 
we have added £170 million of property 
and this, together with the £141 million 
of property additions in the previous 
year, has increased our net rental 
income by 16% to £67.9 million. at the year 
end our ltv was 37%, well positioned 
relative to this range. this will in time 
increase the ltv. we have held 95 meetings with 
investors during the year and i am 
delighted to welcome a number of 
new shareholders onto our register. we 
are now the uk’s largest developer and 
owner-manager of primary healthcare 
property with a property portfolio 
valued at over £1.3 billion. we are continuing 
to source attractive investment 
opportunities and we currently have a 
pipeline of further property acquisitions 
and developments of £153 million 
in solicitors’ hands. our ability to 
“develop, invest and manage” gives us 
a crucial advantage when securing new 
development opportunities and other 
asset management initiatives with gps. shareholder engagement
we are committed to the highest 
standards of financial transparency 
and believe a significant investment 
in investor relations activity is a key 
responsibility for any public company. simon laffin
non-executive chairman
dear shareholder 
assura has continued 
to grow over the last 
12 months. our people and the board
the past year was marked by the tragic 
death of our previous ceo, graham 
roberts. graham stepped down in 
march 2016 and passed away in july, 
having been suffering from cancer. i became executive chairman in march 
last year to cover for graham’s absence. available online at: www.assuraplc.com
