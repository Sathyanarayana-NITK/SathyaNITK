chairman’s statement
i am delighted that the group had 
another very good year delivering 
customer and profit growth, with 
continued investment to deliver our 
strategy. we have accelerated  
our plans with the investment in 
checkatrade in the uk and the  
acquisition of habitissimo in spain. %
based on 1,970 real reviews, from customers like you. people 
homeserve’s success is driven by the 
commitment of its people. on behalf of the 
board, i would like to thank all our people for 
their contribution to another set of very good 
results. there are four areas of progress in the 
year that i would like to specifically 
address in this statement. firstly, the rate of progress in north 
america has been very positive. these are non-ifrs measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets 
(fy17: £14.1m, fy16: £10.4m). overview 5

of customers would
 buy again. we invested £6.0m in the new markets 
segment, as planned (fy16: £5.9m). during fy17, homeserve’s italian business agreed a 
joint venture with edison energia. therefore, the adjusted measures reflect the post acquisition 
revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the group. dividend 
given the group’s performance this year 
and the board’s confidence in its future 
prospects, the board is proposing an increase 
in the final dividend to 11.2p a share, bringing 
the total ordinary dividend for the year to 
15.3p (fy16: 12.7p), an increase of 24%, which 
is 1.76x covered by the fy17 adjusted earnings 
per share compared to 1.72x in fy16. this is in addition 
to 11% group customer growth, 
with customer numbers now at 
7.8m. statutory operating profit was 
up 20% to £104.7m, and adjusted 
operating profit increased 22% to 
£118.8m, both included a £10.3m 
foreign exchange benefit. board changes
during the year david bower was appointed 
as chief financial officer and johnathan 
ford as chief operating officer. we have 
also strengthened the board with the 
appointment of three new directors with 
effect from 23 may 2017. tom rusin has 
been appointed as an executive director 
and katrina cliffe and edward fitzmaurice 
have both been appointed as non-executive 
directors. tom has been chief 
executive officer of homeserve usa since 
july 2011 and is currently a member of the 
homeserve plc executive committee. we re-launched our 
chief executive’s review (continued)
“i've been in my  
home for 13 years. we have a clear vision “to 
be the world’s most trusted provider 
of home repairs and improvements” 
and we have agreed the strategic 
priorities (see page 12 for our 
strategic framework) to ensure we 
achieve it. through 
the strength of the existing business, 
enhanced with the acquisition of utility 
service partners we have achieved the 
3m customer milestone and 50m affinity 
partner households – great progress 
toward our 80m household target. secondly, the strength of affinity 
partnerships is the bedrock of our 
business and i am delighted with the 
launch of aviva response in the uk and 
the new joint venture with edison energia 
in italy. our investment in checkatrade and 
acquisition of habitissimo are a major 
step forward and position us at the fore  
of the online revolution we are seeing  
in home services. acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of 
businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity. digital marketing is already live 
with both partners, a demonstration of 
our mutual commitment. our 
italian business established a joint venture 
with edison energia and we progressed 
our expansion into new countries and 
development of an online on demand 
home repair and improvement offering  
– our “home experts” platform. we achieve 
this by engaging great people in all of our 
businesses and providing them with the best 
technology and systems to do a great job. a reconciliation between the adjusted and statutory equivalent is 
included in the financial review. katrina will also join the audit 
& risk committee. we act as an insurance 
intermediary and do not take any material 
insurance risk. a reconciliation between the adjusted 
and statutory equivalent is included in the 
financial review.
