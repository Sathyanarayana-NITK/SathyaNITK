the group 
has also made good progress towards its 
strategic objectives and in particular, by 
achieving underlying roce of 18.4% in 
the year, ahead of target. transparency 
is central to this objective and you will 
find more detail about our approach and 
progress over the last year in the corporate 
governance section of this report. summary
these results demonstrate the group’s 
resilience in the face of some difficult 
trading conditions, particularly the revenue 
growth achieved in the uk in the second 
half of the year and the continued progress 
in south africa. in view of the success 
achieved in the current year and the strong 
momentum and focus on growth, i remain 
confident that we will continue to make 
progress towards achieving our medium‑ term strategic objectives. norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017

our complementary 
businesses in south africa 
operate principally from 
a shared manufacturing 
and administrative site near 
johannesburg, allowing 
them to maximise 
operational, revenue 
and cost synergies. the group has again delivered a strong 
cash performance, with underlying 
operating cash flow at 99% of underlying 
ebitda (2016: 76%). dividend
the board is recommending a final 
dividend for the year of 4.8p (2016: 4.4p) 
per share. when added to the interim 
dividend of 2.4p (2016: 2.2p) per share 
which was paid on 12 january 2017, this 
will make a total dividend for the year 
of 7.2p (2016: 6.6p) per share, a 9.1% 
increase on the previous year. notwithstanding, this position is a 
significant improvement on the £97.8m 
deficit reported at the half year, which 
had increased primarily because of the 
abnormally low bond yields following the 
eu referendum result. despite the volatility 
experienced in the bond markets and the 
subsequent effect on our pension liabilities, 
which have little impact on scheme cash 
flows, we remain confident that our 
pension obligations continue to be 
appropriately funded and well managed. the result
by enabling a single fitter to install each cabinet, 
significant cost savings in both labour and time 
have been achieved. i am 
pleased that our uk businesses recovered 
well in the second half of the year and were 
able to capitalise on the more stable trading 
environment, delivering growth in all of 
our key segments of retail, trade and 
export. further information and investor

in the uk we offer a wide 
range of quality bathroom 
and kitchen products 
both for domestic and 
commercial applications. the recent acquisitions of croydex and 
abode have been integrated seamlessly 
into the norcros group and are performing 
in line with the board’s expectations. group revenue for the year was £271.2m, 
15.0% higher than the prior year on a 
reported basis, 10.6% higher on a constant 
currency basis and 4.1% higher on a like 
for like constant currency basis. underlying 
operating profit at £23.8m was 11.7% higher 
than the prior year, mainly reflecting a further 
significant improvement in performance in 
our south african business, and a first‑time 
contribution from abode which was acquired 
in march 2016. underlying diluted earnings 
per share was consistent with the previous 
year at 27.8p. our performance in the uk in the second 
half of the year was in marked contrast 
to the first half, with like for like revenue 
(excluding revenues from abode entirely 
and croydex for quarter one) up 8.8% in the 
second half having been down by 5.0% 
in the first half against the comparative 
period. on a constant currency basis 
revenue was 8.3% higher than last year. a sleek, elegant, ultra‑modern

“hang ‘n’ lock”

cost savings with 
“one‑man” installation
the challenge
accessories provide the finishing touches to any 
bathroom but fitting larger items such as mirrored 
cabinets has traditionally been a time-consuming 
“two-man job”. when construction and fit-out specialist, 
willmott dixon, needed to install mirrored cabinets 
in 290 london apartments, it not only required an 
affordable yet stylish design, but also an easy and 
efficient fixing system. our emphasis is on 
innovation, quality and service combined with 
a strong understanding of our customers’ needs. we aim to use our strong brands, our innovative 
products and our leading market positions to 
drive investment returns and shareholder value. our portfolio of businesses 
is well established, services 
a broad customer base 
and benefits from leading 
market positions and 
strong brands. i have 
been encouraged by the quality and 
enthusiasm of the management teams 
of those businesses in identifying and 
pursuing opportunities in collaboration 
with the group’s existing portfolio, particularly 
in the areas of new business development, 
procurement and supply chain. the group is in a 
sound financial position with a strong 
balance sheet and has reduced net debt 
by £9.3m to £23.2m (2016: £32.5m), 
representing leverage of 0.8 times 
underlying ebitda. pension scheme
the gross deficit relating to our uk defined 
benefit pension scheme as calculated under 
ias 19r has increased from £55.7m at 
31 march 2016 to £62.7m at 31 march 2017 
principally reflecting a reduction in bond 
yields. norcros plc annual report and accounts 2017 07

on a sterling reported basis, group revenue 
derived outside of the uk was 42.8% (2016: 
41.6%). *  when the strategic target to grow group revenue to £420m by 2018 was first 
established in the year ended 31 march 2013, the rand/sterling average exchange 
rate was 13.37, compared to the average rand/sterling exchange rate for the year 
ended 31 march 2017 of 18.31. in order to demonstrate the underlying constant 
currency revenue growth over that period, group revenue for the year ended 
31 march 2017 has been recalculated as if the exchange rate had remained 
constant, and on that basis would have been £32.8m higher at £304.0m.
