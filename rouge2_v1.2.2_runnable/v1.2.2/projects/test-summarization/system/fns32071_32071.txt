how we operate
our facilities use established, reliable 
technology based on containerised 
generators, fired with renewable green 
fuel or gas – either mains or liquidified 
natural gas (lng). our unmanned generators 
are connected to the local, low voltage 
distribution network and are therefore 
classified as embedded generation. standalone flexgen 
sites – gas powered
to diversify our project 
portfolio, we have expanded 
our activities into gas 
powered generators, using 
both mains gas as well 
as lng, which provides 
locational flexibility. battery sites
these will generally be 
stand-alone but may be 
used in conjunction with 
gas or solarflex and 
our stand-alone battery 
projects are currently being 
developed in partnership 
with ldt. 23 hanover square, london, w1s 1jb

ppg is a holding company with subsidiaries and investments focused 
on the development and operation of flexible energy generation facilities, 
which play a crucial role in the changing uk energy mix as renewable 
generation replaces carbon intensive generation. nine green fuel projects have been 
financed with a combination of debt and 
£35m of equity by rockpool investments 
llp in individual companies established 
for this purpose. other facilities, which will be gas-
powered, will be held in dedicated 
subsidiary companies as part of a non-

will seek to obtain a majority interest. non-firm) power from batteries or

market drivers
 
on-going structural changes in uk energy supply 
continue to drive demand for flexible power generation 
as the proportion of energy generated from intermittent 
renewable sources continues to grow. plutus powergen plc

04 low dilution  
funding structure
 
committed to a structure that provides project 
flexibility and limited dilution as far as possible  
for ppg shareholders. from the 
winter of 2020/21, this would reduce the embedded 
benefits received by distribution connected 
generators such as ppg to the residual charge. the proposed 
outcomes in relation to the transposition into uk 
law of the medium combustion plant directive 
(mcpd) will require us to fit selective catalytic 
reduction (scr) or other measures to reduce the 
nox from our green fuel fleet, but the cost of this 
is manageable. highlights

• maiden profit before development site write-offs
• commissioning and successful operation of first 20mw facility at 
plymouth, with construction proceeding at five further facilities to be 
connected by year end
• including post year end, all rockpool co-owned sites are either 
operating, in or about to commence construction, amounting to a total 
of 180mw
• strategic shift to the development of higher margin gas operations – 
80mw in planning
• post year end joint venture agreed to develop battery storage sites
• positive outlook post ofgem review, and favourable energy dynamic 
due to energy supply deficit and imbalances – uk power prices peaked 
above £1,500 per mw hour
• strong pipeline of future gas and battery sites expected to significantly 
increase revenue and profitability 
this has been a milestone year, with 
the commissioning of our first site and 
generation of revenue in excess of 
£1.35 million. what we do
our 20mw ‘flexgen’ sites – which can 
generate power within 30 seconds of 
being switched on remotely – provide 
a vital, low cost solution to assist in 
balancing the uk’s energy supply on a 
moment by moment basis. our model is built upon the ability to 
earn revenue from multiple markets for 
flexible power, as well as from secured 
management contracts read more on

• short term operating reserve (stor)
• firm frequency response (ffr)
• triad
• merchant power sales
• capacity market – on 15 year

finally, we have begun to develop battery 
projects through our partnership with 
london & devonshire trust (ldt), which 
represents c.80mw in our pipeline. our first site, in 
plymouth, has traded successfully since 
it began operations in november 2016; 
a further eight renewable green diesel 
20mw projects and a further four 20mw 
gas projects are in various stages of 
development. 1. before write-offs for sites that are not proceeding. charles tatnall

with gas engines, the economics are such that they 
are able to run merchant to take advantage of peak 
prices as well as assist suppliers in managing volatility 
in their retail power books. our business model seeks to mitigate the current 
and forecast risk of an energy deficit through 
the development, construction and operation of 
a portfolio of 20mw power sites, which can be 
switched on at a moment’s notice at times  
of peak demand. since the introduction of intermittent, 
renewable power to the uk’s energy 
mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity 
is retired, the national grid has faced 
increasing risks of brownouts and 
blackouts. uk power prices have seen 
recent peaks above £1,500 per mw 
hour due to outage and generation 
imbalances; there is therefore a need 
for a reliable source of power that can 
be accessed quickly and flexibly during 
periods when demand exceeds available 
supply. these 
projects will allow us to take 
advantage of new markets 
and the anticipated power 
price volatility, as they are 
able to run for longer hours 
at a lower strike price. principal revenues are derived from 
long-term and/or repeatable contracts with large, 
stable counterparties. dividend
we do not propose to pay a dividend as we plan 
to reinvest all internally generated funds for the 
foreseeable future. banks: we have strong relationships with 
a number of banks and other financial 
institutions to provide debt financing, 
including jcb. investors: ppg was readmitted to 
aim in august 2014 to capitalise on the 
opportunity in flexible power generation 
and intends to raise further funding 
from a £50m bond issue to enable us to 
develop further sites. 02

our initial portfolio 
comprises nine rockpool-
funded investee company 
sites (or 180mw). co-located solarflex 
sites
one of our strategic 
priorities is to establish 
solarflex sites, where 
our generators are co-
located – and share grid 
connections – with solar 
farms. our pipeline
we have a total pipeline of over 700mw, and will have 120mw of capacity in operation for this 
winter with a further 140mw at the post-planning stage by the end of 2017.
we aim to develop the following types of projects, and are actively working with a company 
to explore ‘front-ending’ each site using exhaustible (i.e. connections and contracts
national grid: we will secure stor 
and ffr contracts with national grid 
for our facilities, and we have secured 
capacity market contracts for five sites 
and are applying for a further eight 
sites in the capacity market auction in 
february 2018. we are also entering t-1 
cm auction for the 6 facilities that will be 
operational by 1st october 2018. 
energy suppliers: we have negotiated 
power purchase agreements (ppas) with 
two national suppliers. plutus powergen has a 
44.5% stake in each company, and earns 
fees of £150,000 per site per year from 
management contracts. while there is a price cap of £1,500/mwh, there are 
plans in place for this to be raised to £3,000 initially 
and then to £6,000 per mwh. relative to conventional diesel, this fuel 
eliminates sulphur oxides (sox), reduces nitrogen 
oxides (nox) by c.30% and reduces particulates. ppg has a 44.5% stake in each of these 
entities, and currently derives revenue 
from a management contract with 
each site. we 
maintain complete flexibility in financing 
options for both the equity portion and 
the asset finance and maintain dialogue 
with many providers of finance. the technologies are 
highly complementary, since 
our generators would use 
the connections when not 
required by the solar farms, 
and would therefore allow 
greater utilisation of the 
connections. by providing 
an additional return to the 
solar farm operators, we 
would help to accelerate 
the development of solar 
farms without the need for 
subsidy. proven
