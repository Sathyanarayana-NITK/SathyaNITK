strategic report overview
employee engagement is a key measure that 
we monitor closely to determine how 
effectively we are promoting these values 
and to confirm that we are upholding the 
high standards we expect. effective reporting systems and controls help 
the board to manage and mitigate risk, but 
cannot eliminate it altogether. higher interest costs and the 
impact of exceptional charges resulted in a 
reported loss per share of 3.26p (2016: loss 
per share of 2.60p). 30%+
the uk’s guarantor 
loans market is 
estimated to be growing 
at 30%+ per annum. 2 low pay is defined as the value that is two-thirds of median hourly earnings. 7 ons – annual survey of hours and earnings. whilst more 
expensive to operate than other 
models, it means we can lend 
when others can’t (or won’t). edwin’s story 
we lend a hand when 
most others won’t. page 18
stephen’s story 
we offer responsible, affordable 
lending with the human touch, 
meeting most of our customers 
face-to-face. this effort continued throughout 
2017 and thanks to the drive and 
determination of our new business leaders, 
we have been able to refine and start to 
embed these values across the group as 
part of our appraisal and reward process. strategy
our strategy remains unchanged. each of these segments offers 
significant opportunity for growth and 
having already achieved our target of 20% 
loan book growth across the group as a 
whole, we remain on course to also deliver a 
20% return on assets in each of our 
operating divisions. each of these is explained in more detail in 
the strategic report on pages 6 to 53.
management
during 2017 we made a number of changes to 
the senior management in each of our three 
business divisions. these changes resulted in a 
marked increase in both ambition and pace of 
execution – a combination that is feeding 
through into enhanced operational and 
financial performance. reported results normalised results

years, the fca has confirmed that this 
has been driven by prime customers,  
not those with lower credit scores

. 3. trustpilot.com is an online review community website. this will be achieved 
through the execution of the three elements 
of our business strategy:
• being a leader in our chosen markets; 
• investing in our core assets; and 
• acting responsibly. culture
in last year’s annual report i set out the 
process that we had initiated to identify the 
core elements that underpin the culture of 
each of our businesses and the target 
behaviours that we believe will enable us to 
succeed. this is proving popular among staff as a 
source of the latest company news as well 
as a repository for useful documents and 
procedures. an abridged version of the 
intranet is also available to all of our 
self-employed agents that represent an 
important stakeholder group.
