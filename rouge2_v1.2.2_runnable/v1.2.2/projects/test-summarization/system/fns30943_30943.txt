o&o* audience  
(monthly average)
o&o audience is the sum of the 
website visitors, social media 
users, magazine readership, app 
users and visitors to time out 
market in the month. with its two divisions time out digital and time out market, the group aims to connect consumers 
and businesses in the leisure, travel and local entertainment sector through b2c and b2b offerings. time out digital is a multi-platform media, entertainment and e-commerce business with a global 
content distribution network comprising websites, mobile, apps, social channels, magazines, guides, 
live events and international licensing agreements. the company seeks to grow earnings from b2c and 
b2b relationships through on-site transactions and advertising from global brands and local businesses. to further grow transactions of tickets 
and bookings, time out enhanced its e-commerce platform 
and expanded its e-commerce products, making more of its 
content bookable. time out 
market is currently present in lisbon and the group is rolling this successful format out to new cities. key events throughout the year were battle of 
the burger (chicago, new york and los angeles), passport to 
portugal in new york (sponsored by tap air portugal), silent 
discos in the paris zoo and the shard in london, outdoor 
movie pop ups in lisbon and movies on the river in london, 
the first floating cinema on the river thames. in 2017, the group owned and operated businesses in 20 countries 
and 76 cities such as london, new york, chicago, miami, los 
angeles, hong kong, melbourne, lisbon, barcelona and paris. in a 
further 20 countries and 32 cities such as tokyo, tel aviv and dubai 
the group used international licensing arrangements with partners. it all began in london in 1968 when time out helped people explore the exciting new urban cultures that 
started up all over the capital. since then, it has consistently maintained its status as the go-to source of 
inspiration for both locals and visitors alike. everything time out does helps people discover, book and share what the world’s cities have to offer. millions of travel and leisure purchasing decisions are being influenced by time out’s unique and 
trusted high-quality content - curated by professional journalists - about food, drink, entertainment, 
film, music, attractions, art, culture, shopping, night-life, hotels and travel. ebitda contribution was a loss of £0.5m. ebitda contribution was a loss of £0.5m. adjusted ebitda
