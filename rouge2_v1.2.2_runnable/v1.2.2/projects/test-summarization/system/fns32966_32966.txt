*  subject to partnering. • explore – discover – sell. ** subject to partnering and dependent on outcome of adjacent drilling. the rabat deep 1 well, targeting the jp-1 
prospect in rabat deep offshore morocco,  
was drilled by the rabat deep partnership to  
a total depth of 3,180m with the saipem 12000 
sixth generation ultra-deepwater drillship. it 
penetrated a thick top seal and encountered 
tight, fractured carbonates in the primary target 
and consequently was plugged and abandoned 
with the data collected used to calibrate existing 
data sets to understand the implications on the 
prospectivity of the surrounding area. drilling preparations have therefore 
commenced for prospect s (audited gross 
mean prospective resources of 459mmbbls) in 
namibia in anticipation of a q4 2018 spud and 
kenitra-1 (gross mean prospective resources 
of 464mmbbls) in chariot’s operated acreage

building a balanced portfolio 
of giant potential assets 
chariot has secured significant 
acreage positions in highly prospective 
underexplored new and emerging 
hydrocarbon provinces within 
the atlantic margins. with a strong funding position and no remaining commitments across 
its operated portfolio chariot initiated a three well drilling campaign 
in q1 2018. whilst the drilling results of the rabat deep 1 well were 
disappointing, we look forward to additional drilling in the year  
ahead, where chariot’s high impact portfolio will be tested in  
the knowledge that, with its wider focus, we have exposure  
to additional drilling opportunities across a variety of basins  
and play types. this timing is crucial. this timing is crucial.
