strategic report
2 section title: page ref scapa group plc annual report and accounts 2017 3 2 strategic report “ i am impressed 
with the vision and 
opportunities that  
still remain to fully 
achieve scapa’s 
potential in both 
healthcare and 
industrial.”
dear shareholder 
i am pleased to join scapa at an important 
juncture in its journey that began with james 
wallace, my predecessor. during the past eight years, scapa’s share 
price has risen from £0.095 in march 2009 to 
£4.00 in may 2017 , generating over £600m of 
shareholder value. at scapa, we base our approach on a 
deep understanding of our core markets. this understanding allows us to anticipate 
tomorrow’s customer needs and to enable 
our customers to succeed in dynamic markets. with a global reach in each 
of the markets in which we participate, 
we are focused on sustainable growth 
and innovation, improving the solutions for 
our customers by applying our knowledge 
and expertise in advanced material 
technology and process solutions. with our global 
footprint we can service and support all 
customer needs wherever they may be. this year it achieved 
the long-term objective of double-digit trading 
profit margins. we recognised that 
to deliver the double-digit profit growth we 
could not rely solely on revenue growth, 
particularly given the uncertain and endemic 
macro environment. we have reset our profit margin target to 
mid-teens which compares to the market 
leaders. the uk deficit increased 
slightly to £23.8m as a result of the reduction 
in the discount rate, and the total deficit 
of £31.4m, including a number of small 
overseas schemes, is now less than 1x the 
ebitda of the business. scapa group plc annual report and accounts 2017
fulfilling 
 potential
scapa group plc annual report and accounts 2017 scapa group is a global 
supplier of bonding solutions 
and manufacturer of 
adhesive‑based products 
for the healthcare and 
industrial markets. market snapshot
the market sectors on which we 
focus include automotive, cable, 
construction, consumer and specialty 
products. these are split into engineered 
products – designed for specific customer 
applications – and consumer, serviced 
through distributors. the evolution from 
an industrial tape company to a global 
adhesive technology-based company with 
two distinct businesses, each with an exciting 
strategy and outlook, has been impressive. the board remains 
focused on ensuring its own effectiveness and 
that of the governance processes throughout 
the group. commentary generating sufficient levels of 
cash to ensure that the group is able to pursue 
its strategic goals. this measure indicates the 
group performance in reducing accidents 
and improving health and safety for 
our employees. why we measure protecting our people 
and acting responsibly is a must. as i review the results and 
accomplishments of the group, i am very 
impressed with the volume and pace of the 
activities. however, i am equally impressed 
with the vision and opportunities that still 
remain to fully achieve scapa’s potential 
in both healthcare and industrial. through continuous 
investment, including three successful 
acquisitions, the latest of which was 
euromed in may 2016, scapa has built a 
comprehensive set of capabilities across the 
entire value chain. our 
challenge is to convert the projects into 
revenue through flawless execution. the industrial business 
operates across a 
wide range of markets 
and geographies. industrial serves diverse markets and 
geographies and its revenue performance 
reflects the composite macro dynamics.
