s ta tement the edc division contributed £9.3m (2001:
£7 .0m) operating profit, an increase of 33%. the
residual exposure is secured by 450,000
dicom group shares, currently held in escrow. staff
staff numbers grew from 718 to 773 during the
year, principally due to the acquisition of a
majority stake in dicom asia. acquisitions
on 27 june 2002 dicom group announced it
had increased its holding in dicom asia
holdings pte ltd from 40% to 80% by
purchasing the balance from local management. however connectivity
between input devices and applications is
frequently inadequate or absent resulting in
data and document access being imprecise,
slow and hence expensive. product developments
our award winning virtual rescan™ (vrs)
product line, which optimises both image quality
and the scan process, continues to do very well. the asic version
of vrs, which is being sold on the basis of oem
agreement for use in document scanners, is
being sold to both new scanner manufacturers
and for new scanner models thereby increasing
its future sales prospects significantly. ascent capture 5.5, a major release of the award
winning capture application, was launched in
may 2002 offering broader product functionality
and improved support for high performance
databases. this represents 82% of dicom group’s total
operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items. exceptional charges
as previously announced dicom group has
incurred certain costs during the year, which
have been treated as exceptional charges. following the default on 1 april 2002 of a
scheduled consideration payment dicom group
has reviewed its overall exposure in relation to a
non-core investment disposed of in early 2000.
a provision of £4m (with no adverse future cash
flow implications) is considered necessary. this
sum is treated as an exceptional item. during the year the core edc (electronic
document capture) division continued to bene-
fit from its position as the leading global
partner for edc products and services with a
significant level of new contract gains. in the
face of very challenging global it market condi-
tions edc continued its growth record and
expanded its market position by new product
launches and additional partnership
agreements. the sga (samsung general agency) division
experienced declining turnover rates in difficult
trading conditions, but maintained an
acceptable, albeit lower, level of operating profit
contribution. during the year edc also
launched a number of new products and
entered new partnership arrangements, which
will enable the group to address new areas of
the edc market. about

i am pleased to report a record set of results for
the financial year 2002, a period marked by the
most challenging trading conditions in the
global it industry for a long time. group
turnover for the year to 30 june 2002 was up
7% to £149.5m (2001: £140.3m). acquisitions
contributed 1% of turnover growth. operating
profit before exceptional items amounted to
£9.2m (2001: £8.1m), an increase of 14%. dicom group’s business prospects in the us
have not been materially adversely affected by
the discontinuance of the us distributor. the edc solutions offered by dicom group
solve this dilemma at an attractive cost to
benefit ratio. edc investments, however,
were broadly saved from this development as
they allow quick payback periods to be
achieved. blue chip software houses and system
integrators have continued to integrate ascent
capture products and vrs into their solutions as
a result of ongoing focused sales and marketing
initiatives. we are very pleased to have elected
arnold von büren to succeed me as ceo from 1
july 2002. arnold has been with the group
since 1994 and recently managed the successful
integration of kofax since february 2000.
before that he was responsible for the europe-
based edc operations. in
july 2002 dicom group applied for a de-listing
from the neuer markt segment of the deutsche
börse in frankfurt, while retaining its listing on
the main board (“geregelter markt”). arnold von büren
