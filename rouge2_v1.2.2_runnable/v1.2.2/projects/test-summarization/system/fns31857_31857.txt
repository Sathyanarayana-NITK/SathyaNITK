overview
i am pleased to introduce the group’s  
annual report & accounts for the year 
ended 30 june 2017 . the grass mata mpl product 
completed the safety study relating 
to its higher dose and the phase 
ii grass trial is due to commence 
before the end of 2017. 
financially, the group remains in a 
robust position with a strong cash 
balance due to strong sales growth, 
aided additionally by the weakening 
of sterling against the euro. acarovac 
plus and probiotics continued 
to gain market share with the 
former being the fastest growing 
component of the spanish portfolio. this 
product, if successful through the 
trial programme, could become a 
global best-in-class product with 
the first short course subcutaneous 
treatment in a global market 
worth an estimated $3-4bn
