chairman’s 
statement
on behalf of the board i am very  
pleased to report excellent progress in 
pursuit of our ambition to become a 
leading global retailer of musical 
instruments and equipment. notwithstanding the investment 
necessary for our next phase of 
expansion, the board remains focused 
on delivering profitable growth, and  
as such is pleased to announce an 
operating profit of £2.6m which is a 
£1.7m (+192%) improvement on fy16’s 
underlying operating profit (adjusted  
to remove one-off ipo costs). andrew wass
chief executive officer
4 july 2017
chief executive’s statement continued
the response to the group’s placing in may 
2017 was extremely pleasing and i believe 
raising £4.2m reflects well on our progress  
to date and prospects. the news was well received by 
the team, and we’re all looking 
forward to the move scheduled 
for late summer 2017.
andrew wass
chief executive officer
new head office
our staff are central to our success and 
uk office space was close to becoming  
a growth constraint. the operational board meets at least 
once each month to analyse and discuss 
operational and commercial matters, 
and to identify any material matters for 
escalation to the plc board. swedish commercial

risks and 
uncertainties
the board recognise that certain risks and 
uncertainties can have significant rewards 
for the prospects of the business, and as 
such require careful identification, 
evaluation and management. customers are 
typically the end-users of our products. we believe we can achieve this by leveraging technology to deliver 
an industry-leading customer experience, providing the products 
our customers want delivered to them quickly and efficiently. a bespoke e-commerce platform allows us to efficiently 
operate 19 websites, and as we develop this platform further, widen 
our product ranges and increase our marketing reach and brand 
recognition, we strongly believe we can continue to grow our share 
of the £4.3bn european market and expand our reach beyond this. our e-commerce platform is 
configured to select the most cost-effective delivery options 
from 13 different delivery service providers, to provide our 
customers with a class-leading range of delivery options. when writing this statement last year,  
our revenue growth expectation for the 
year ahead was 37%, and the 58% growth 
we actually achieved reflects the huge 
effort made by our staff right across the 
business, from the board of directors 
and senior management, through to our 
customer service and warehouse teams. international growth of 124% has been 
particularly pleasing, and this is an area  
in which we will continue to invest 
significant effort and resource to improve 
and increase our global reach, building 
on the early success of our recently 
launched swedish and german 
distribution operations. in many ways, this has been a 
transformational year for the business, 
and to effectively manage further  
growth and operational complexities  
the group formed an operational  
board on 1 march 2017 to support and 
complement the plc board, comprising  
a wide breadth and depth of operational 
and commercial experience. to ensure we remain positioned for 
further growth, the group requires 
additional head office capacity, and  
the board is delighted to announce a 
property acquisition that provides an 
excellent long-term solution to our 
growth needs in our home city of york. we leverage our technology and empower our specialist staff 
to ensure key touch points deliver a market-leading experience, 
and monitor our progress carefully using independent sources 
such as trustpilot. once opportunities have been identified and validated, market-specific websites will 
be launched. examples of new features deployed during fy17 include the integration of multiple hubs to automatically  
select the most appropriate dispatch location, international ‘click & collect’, shopping basket and checkout 
enhancements, mobile website improvements and website cloudification. a digital personalisation platform has been deployed and will continue to be developed and refined in fy18 to 
ensure customers receive relevant information and offers through all communication channels. this 
translates into net profit of £2.3m  
and earnings per share of 11.5 pence. our return on investment in marketing continues to improve, with spend as a proportion of revenue falling from 
10.0% in fy15, to 8.7% in fy16, to 8.3% in fy17. our return on investment in marketing continues to improve, with spend as a proportion of revenue falling from

gear4music’s staff, the high standard of customer service that 
gear4music provides and the high standard of presentation 
both online and at the gear4music showrooms. own-brand products

do and we’re learning from
