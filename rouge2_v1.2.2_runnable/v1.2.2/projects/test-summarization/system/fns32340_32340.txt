strategic report
the strategic report includes an overview  
of our strategy and business model, the 
principal risks we face and information about 
our performance. uk electricity transmission
we own and operate the electricity 
transmission network in england and wales, 
with day-to-day responsibility for balancing 
supply and demand. we operate but do not 
own the scottish networks. our networks 
comprise approximately 7 ,200 kilometres  
(4,474 miles) of overhead line, 1,500 kilometres 
(932 miles) of underground cable and 342 
substations. uk gas transmission
we own and operate the gas national 
transmission system (nts) in great britain, 
with day-to-day responsibility for balancing 
supply and demand. we use adjusted profit  
measures which exclude the 
impact of exceptional items and 
remeasurements. this has created value 
for our shareholders through a significant gain 
on the disposal. i am also pleased that we voluntarily 
set aside £150 million of the sale proceeds  
that will be used to benefit consumers. firstly, the strength of the balance sheet and 
our key credit metric of retained cash flow 
divided by adjusted net debt. we play a vital role in connecting millions of 
people to the energy they use, safely, reliably and efficiently. standing back from the detail of these 
accounts, i would like to highlight two aspects. it is a responsibility we  
take very seriously, and when we fall short  
of expected levels of safety, we make sure 
lessons are learnt and shared, as well as 
making sure we take any necessary remedial 
actions as soon as is practicable. at national grid we are focusing on five 
of these goals where we can help to make a 
difference. in addition to the financial 
review included within this section, we provide 
additional analysis and commentary, including 
the performance of our operating segments, 
within the unaudited commentary sections  
of the financial statements. this additional 
analysis forms part of our strategic report. at a glance 02

want more information or help? our networks deliver gas to approximately  
3.6 million customers. other activities
our other activities mainly relate to non-
regulated businesses and other commercial 
operations not included within the business 
segments including: interconnectors;  
uk-based gas metering activities; uk property 
management; a uk liquefied natural gas  
(lng) importation terminal; us lng operations;  
us unregulated transmission pipelines; and 
corporate activities. for example, we have made significant 
progress in our search for low-carbon

of our network and the equipment insulated 
with this gas is now energised. in the us, similar services are provided by independent system operators. with effect from april 
2017 , we have brought together key assets 
outside our core regulated businesses into  
this new unit. the consortium comprises macquarie 
infrastructure and real assets, allianz capital 
partners, hermes investment management, 
cic capital corporation, qatar investment 
authority, dalmore capital and amber 
infrastructure limited/international public 
partnerships. over the past year, we have seen significant 
developments both in our external environment 
and within the company. we seek to 
ensure that supply and demand are balanced in real-time and we facilitate the connection of assets 
to the transmission system. the energy industry needs  
to work hard to demonstrate affordability and 
build trust with consumers and communities 
who feel disconnected from the opportunities 
that technological and market changes 
can bring. it 
helps to retain and attract people to the area, 
supporting the wider economic recovery of  
the region. looking ahead
we will work closely with our customers  
and stakeholders to understand the impact  
of the uk exit from the eu as brexit 
negotiations develop. we include reports from  
the audit, nominations, remuneration, 
finance, and safety, environment and  
health committees. please
