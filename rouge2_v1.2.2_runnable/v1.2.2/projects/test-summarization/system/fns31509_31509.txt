we made significant progress in the fourth year of  
our major process and systems investment programme. we have made a good start with our £100 million supply 
chain investment programme to increase logistics 
capacity, consolidate our manufacturing operations into 
centres of excellence to improve product quality and 
support shop growth, allowing us to compete more 
effectively in the food-on-the-go market. having made strong progress in 
recent years, we have set the bar higher 
with our vision and strategic plan reflecting 
longer-term ambitions and commitment  
to putting the customer at the heart of  
our strategy. this was 
achieved despite significant inflationary 
headwinds and alongside continued major

strategic progress
2017 has been another year of strong performance as 
we continued on our journey to transform greggs into  
a winning brand in the food-on-the-go market. the result has 
been a fourth consecutive year of strong like-for-like 
sales growth and record profits. dividend
our progressive dividend policy targets an ordinary 
dividend that is two times covered by earnings,  
with any further surplus capital being returned to 
shareholders. this environment 
seems unlikely to change in the short term as the uk 
negotiates its exit from the european union, with the 
associated risks to consumer confidence and further 
cost inflation. greggs plc annual report and accounts 2017

we stand for great tasting, 
freshly prepared food that 
our customers can trust, at 
affordable prices and aim  
to become the customers’ 
favourite for food-on-the-go. with ownership of our supply chain and ambitions to grow to over  
2,000 shops nationwide, we are in a unique position to make good, 
freshly prepared food accessible to everyone, ensuring that  
‘everyday tastes good’ at greggs. we’ve 
been busy developing our great product offer to meet 
customer needs, opening more shops in new locations 
while refurbishing our existing estate and investing in 
improved customer service. our purpose
our business began in the 1930s, serving fresh 
bakery products to working families in the north  
east at prices everyone could afford. our balanced choice range  
now accounts for more than £100 million of sales with each item 
containing fewer than 400 calories and rated green or amber on  
the nutrition traffic light system. our strategy has four pillars:
1. great tasting, freshly prepared food
greggs products are differentiated by the way we 
freshly prepare food each day in our shops and by 
offering outstanding value for good quality, great 
tasting food-on-the-go. sales of hot sandwiches and 
hot soup are growing well and provide a platform 
for further menu development, which we intend 
will create the opportunity to extend trading  
in greggs for longer in the day as our  
reputation grows. unlike the majority of our competitors, 
who resell bought-in finished products, we are a 
large-scale food manufacturer in our own right 
dealing at source with base ingredients. as a result, we can now be found in retail parks, 
shopping centres, industrial estates and office 
parks. we are also located where our customers 
need us when travelling, with shops in travel  
hubs, roadside locations with parking and now  
in drive thru format. through our franchise 
partnerships we are also in motorway service 
stations and petrol forecourts. look closer
