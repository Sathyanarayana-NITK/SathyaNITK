we received a number of further endorsements from which? 2017 annual awards ceremony. in 
addition, we received four awards from moneywise, and were voted uk national public 
champion (and named as a finalist in the business of the year category for companies 
with a turnover of €150m or higher) in the european business awards. combined with our recent award from which? dual fuel); otherwise, energy will generally consist of electricity alone. this performance was achieved in the face of challenging market conditions, with the 
strong headwinds we have seen over the last few years persisting during the first half of the 
year. this enhancement, combined with our more competitive market position, led to an 
increase in partner activity as we progressed through q4, taking full year customer and 
service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively 
– an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. we anticipate 
volumes will start to improve from their current low levels as we start marketing this new service more 
pro-actively, and remain confident that insurance has the potential to make a material contribution to the 
financial performance of the group in due course. members choosing to take 
advantage of these offers by purchasing 
through our online clubhouse, will receive the 
extra discount as cashback on their  
bill - irrespective of the means of payment 
they have chosen. as previously reported, we responded to this more favourable environment by making 
a change to our partner compensation plan at the beginning of q4; this gave partners 
the opportunity to accelerate some of the residual income they would earn on new 
members who switched all their utilities to us. proposed share buyback
we previously announced our intention to carry out a tender offer this summer, under which we would seek 
to return to shareholders the cash we received from the sale of our stake in opus; we have now decided to 
reduce the maximum size of this tender offer to £25m. full details of the tender offer will be included with the agm documents which will be sent to all 
shareholders shortly. report and accounts

financial and operating highlights 
* financial years 2011 – 2014 are restated. fy17 adjusted pre-tax profit (£53.3m) and eps exclude share incentive scheme charges (£1.2m), amortisation of the energy 
supply contract intangible asset (£11.2m), and any contribution from the company’s former 20% shareholding in opus energy group limited 
(‘opus’) which was sold in february 2017; as a discontinued operation, and for ease of comparability, the contribution from opus has therefore 
been excluded from profit before tax and eps for fy17 and historic accounting periods. looking at the figures from continuing 
operations, adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 9.1% to £53.3m (2016: £48.8m), and 
statutory pre-tax profits reached £40.9m (2016: £35.1m), on revenue down by 0.6% to 
£740.3m (2016: £744.7m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 7.2% to 53.3p 
(2016: 49.7p), and statutory eps increased to 38.0p (2016: 32.8p). we also 
generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in 
opus (see below), taking our total post-tax profit to £95.0m (2016: £31.8m). which? which? our mission is to be the nation’s most trusted utility supplier...

welcome to the club
although we’re a major british business, we’re not like other utility suppliers. the more 
services you take, the more you can save. one bill, one contact
we make life easier for you – with one clear, simple monthly bill for all the 
services you take. it shows you where you make extra savings and get more 
value. these third party 
independent endorsements are a testament to our customer-centric approach, our 
commitment to treating our members fairly, our ongoing mission to be the nation’s 
most trusted utility provider, and the significant resources invested in delivering the best 
possible customer service. this will provide greater flexibility for the company to take advantage of the strategic opportunities that 
we expect to arise over the next few years, resulting from the rapidly changing political and regulatory 
environment for the services we supply. we find it difficult to understand how in the face of these market dynamics, this 
multitude of sub-scale competitors can develop a viable long-term business model. chairman’s statement

chairman’s statement 
i am delighted to report another successful year for the company with adjusted profits, 
earnings and dividends all reaching record levels. and while the record gap between standard variable energy tariffs and aggressively 
priced introductory deals started to narrow during the autumn, this happened too late to 
provide any positive impact on our service and customer numbers for q3.
