oil, gas and condensate reserves as of 1 january 2018
in february 2018, volga gas commissioned an updated reserve report of the group’s oil, gas 
and condensate reserves. during 2017 , the main focus of the capital 
investment was in two projects that are 
expected to provide incremental revenues 
material impact in reducing the operating 
profits of the group to us$0.1 million 
(2016: us$2.51 million), due to an increase 
in the depletion charge to us$8.6 million 
(2016: us$5.0 million). given the constraints to gas and condensate 
production experienced in 2017 , the board 
is pleased to report that revenues have been 
broadly maintained at us$37.1 million (2016: 
us$39.4 million), ebitda at us$8.8 million 
(2016: us$9.6 million) and operating cash 
flow before working capital movements at 
us$9.0 million (2016: us$10.4 million). this 
is in addition to paying us$5.0 million in 
dividends to shareholders in 2017 (2016: nil). as a consequence, ebitda for 2017 was 
us$8.8 million (2016: us$9.6 million). contents

chairman’s statement
dear shareholder,
during 2017 conditions for the oil and gas 
industry worldwide and for russia generally 
have been more stable than in the recent 
past. these assets provide a platform for 
the group to grow in the future, through 
successful exploration and by selective  
value-accretive acquisitions. the board 
believes that volga gas has a stable 
foundation and the financial and 
operational capability to develop and 
extend these assets to provide long-
term value for our shareholders. the board remains committed to a policy 
of enhanced dividend distribution and 
is planning to modify its dividend policy 
towards higher rates of distribution, having 
in mind the requirements of the business and 
the need to maintain its financial strength. for the time being 
however, the board considers it prudent 
to defer a decision on the dividend level 
until the incremental cash flow from the 
investments undertaken in 2017 begins to be 
realised. 2017 progress
managed production primarily from the 
vm#3 and vm#4 wells. throughput at the gas plant was 
gradually increased and in december 2017 
was averaged 533,000 m
3
 per day (18.8 
mmcf/d). domestic market 
conditions in 2017 were generally more 
favourable and consequently condensate 
exports declined significantly and ceased 
altogether from the end of march 2017. in 
total, approximately 15% of condensate sales 
were exported during 2017 , compared to 
48% of the total condensate sales in 2016.
during 2017 , the average condensate 
netback price (after accounting for export 
taxes and transportation costs) increased 
38% to us$34.37 per barrel (2016: us$24.83). the plant was 
designed with a maximum throughput 
capacity of one million m
3
/day (35.3 mmcf/d). production during 2017 averaged 19.1 
mmcf/d of gas and 1,163 bpd of condensate 
(2016: 25.5 mmcf/d of gas and 1,557 bpd 
condensate) an overall decrease of 25% in 
equivalent barrels of oil terms. following a revised conversion from tonnes 
to barrels, as the oil contained in the 
albian reservoir has slightly higher density 
than the oil in the aptian reservoir, there 
is a modest restatement in the uzen oil 
reserves as expressed in barrels. 3. the reserve estimates were prepared in metric units: tonnes for oil, condensate and lpg and standard cubic metres for gas. the conversion ratios from tonnes to barrels applied in the table above were 7.833 barrels per tonne of oil, 8.75 barrels per 
tonne of condensate and 11.75 barrels per tonne of lpg.
