we place individuality at the centre of our 
approach and are committed to continuing to 
offer our clients a personal service. profit before tax for 2017 increased 17.6% to Â£58.9 million after 
incurring the costs associated with the relocation of our london 
office and in pursuing strategic opportunities. these costs were 
partially offset by a plan amendment gain arising from the closure 
of our defined benefit pension schemes. during 
the year we have:
 â€” established the infrastructure necessary to support 
more efficient deployment of it across the firm
 â€” implemented the changes necessary to meet the 
requirements of mifid ii (markets in financial 
instruments directive)
 â€” continued to improve our data management 
capabilities. governance, culture and the board  
last year, i wrote that one of my priorities was to ensure board 
oversight of the firmâ€™s culture and its development. this is  
now one of my specific responsibilities. responding to risks and regulation 
the report from the chairman of the group ri sk committee, 
kathryn matthews, is set out on page 68. we continue to enhance 
our risk management processes, and, this year, have paid 
particular attention to identifying and monitoring emerging risks 
such as cybercrime, money laundering and data theft. the team is diverse, in both its 
expertise and experience, and aims to deliver a suitably tailored 
investment portfolio to meet the complex needs of charity 
clients and trustees. the team  
is highly proactive on ethical and sustainability issues,  
engaging directly with companies and government to  
improve business practices. rathbone private office 
we have also recently established the rathbone private office  
to help larger clients with more complex needs to protect, 
enhance and organise their wealth across multiple managers, 
asset classes and investment markets. these additional services are 
valued by our clients and are an important point of 
differentiation from many of our peers. . . . . the executive team responded well to 
developments in a rapidly changing wealth management market, 
and our investment managers achieved good risk-adjusted 
returns for our clients in a time of great uncertainty and 
persistently low interest rates. uk and global investment markets performed well in 2017, with 
some indices reaching record levels towards the end of the year. we will continue to apply this discipline when we pursue 
other opportunities. continued momentum  
in 2014, we set out a five-year strategy which had the ambition to 
reach Â£40 billion of funds under management by the end of 2018. 
accepting that investment market s have been favourable, we are 
now well within sight of that goal with many of our strategic 
initiatives continuing to gain momentum. we also took action to reduce the risks 
associated with our defined bene fit pension schemes. we believe 
that the other significant risks to our business are operational risks, 
which are increased by growth, and regulatory risks, which are 
increased by continual changes to regulations in our sector. the challenge the current climate 
brings is to secure the scale economies and operational efficiencies 
necessary to respond positively to demographic changes and 
technological advances, whilst reacting to a climate of increasing 
price pressure. our risk governance, risk processes and risk infrastructure have continued to 
mature to ensure our management of risk considers existing and emerging challenges. funds can also be accessed by international clients through a 
rathbone luxembourg funds sica v (sociÃ©tÃ© dâ€™investisement Ã  
capital variable) which allows access to a similar range of actively 
managed master funds, through a master-feeder structure. read more on our business model on page 8
