the site is producing gross 
annual rental income of £1.5 million and is 
a good example of how we sweat our assets 
and ensure that we maximise every income 
opportunity from our land bank. accordingly, we  
have capitalised the relevant borrowing 
costs in relation to wilton park and have 
included current year funding costs of £1.09 
million within inventories (2016 restated*: 
£0.85 million) in the group’s balance sheet. this has resulted in a significantly stronger maturity profile for the group balance sheet with 
net current assets increasing to £159.9 million (2016 restated*: £96.7 million). inland homes annual report and accounts 2017 12 stock code: inl 25624.01 – 11 october 2017 4:25 pm – proof 2
growth in construction costs
the bcis private housing construction price index has 
shown that housebuilders have seen cost increases of 5% 
in the year to march 2017 with materials costs rising due to 
the devaluation of sterling and labour costs rising due to an 
acute skill shortage. our foundations have been 
built on a proactive and decisive approach 
to identifying the right land opportunities, 
and our ability to navigate the complex 
planning system and maximising the 
potential of the final development. once secured, our knowledge of and 
relationships with local authorities, and 
the wealth of experience in our land and 
planning teams, means that we are able  
to secure valuable planning consent for  
the sites we own and manage. inland is continuing to focus on acquiring  
a mix of brownfield sites, as well as strategic 
land, which is essentially greenfield land 
acquired with the knowledge that it could lead 
to a development opportunity at a later date. whilst we have been involved in 
these projects for a little while now, we are 
looking to expand in this area to maximise 
the opportunities and value available. key

chairman’s statement
performance
inland homes has delivered another 
solid performance this year, on top of the 
significant investment that has been made 
into building the strength and expertise 
of our team, which has almost doubled in 
terms of headcount. the group achieved a profit before tax 
and before revaluation of investment 
properties of £18.1 million (2016 restated*: 
£15.7 million) and a 4.3% increase in 
epra net asset value of £194.4 million 
(2016 restated*: £186.3 million). including 
revaluation of investment properties, the 
profit before tax was £19.6 million (2016 
restated*: £33.7 million). our confidence in delivering 
significant further growth 
for our shareholders 
is underpinned by the 
considerable shortage of 
new homes in the area and 
price point we operate in, 
as well as the quality of our 
land assets.”

during the year, the group sold 188 private 
units (2016: 147 units) at an average price 
of £306,000 (2016: £337,000). our versatile structure, local insight  
and opportunistic approach gives us  
a competitive advantage, ensuring we 
can react fast to secure the sites we want 
at a price that provides healthy returns. our ambitious developments, combining 
style, comfort and sustainability for a wide 
social demographic, deliver appropriate 
rewards for our business, our stakeholders, 
our shareholders and the local community. ensuring sustainable 
operations and developments is of 
paramount importance, and our 
commitment to this ensures that we  
can continue as a successful business. we have recruited a 
considerable number of highly experienced 
individuals to create the right structure to 
support the future growth of the company; 
in particular we have made further key 
appointments to the construction team 
as we move away from reliance on main 
contractors and develop this part of the 
business as an additional revenue stream. the size 
of the sites ranges from under 50 plots to 
over 1,350 plots. the strategic land we currently have in  
our land bank typically has a 2–5 year 
timeline for planning permission and 
has the potential for approximately 2,270 
residential plots across 408 acres. our 
enhanced construction capability has 
enabled the group to provide ‘turnkey’ 
delivery of homes to housing associations, 
usually where the land has been purchased 
from inland homes. key differentiators  
of inland homes
inland homes has a large and growing 
land bank of 6,936 plots, of which 2,137 
have planning consent or a resolution 
to grant planning consent. increasingly, we are utilising our own land 
bank to grow our housebuilding operations 
and this growth will continue to optimise 
our revenue profile. as a 
business, inland is moving into a much 
larger average site size. we are also increasing the number of plots 
that we have within larger regeneration 
schemes. whilst the 
average sales price is lower than the 
previous year, this reflects the mix of units 
sold during the year in what remains an 
attractive price point within the geographic 
areas in which we operate. sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. at inland, sustainability is at the heart  
of everything we do. 25624.01 – 11 october 2017 4:25 pm – proof 2

who we are
sustainability
at the heart of 
everything we do
inland homes is an established land 
regeneration business, focused on 
developing sites in the south and south  
east of england for residential and mixed 
use projects. this is lower than 
last year because of a revaluation uplift of 
£18.0 million in the previous year at wilton 
park, beaconsfield, buckinghamshire. this is endorsed 
by a current forward order book of £33 
million (including forward sales within 
joint ventures) (2016: £22.5 million). inland homes has a clear and agile 
business model giving us the flexibility 
to realise value in the land bank through 
consented plot sales, sales to registered 
providers, housebuilding or rental income 
from investment property. implications for inland homes
• rising costs in relation to materials will impact on 
housebuilding profit margins and we have begun to buy 
materials directly from suppliers rather than via main 
contractors in order to ensure we are obtaining the best 
value as well as derive further savings by becoming a bulk 
purchaser. • the skills shortage and resulting wage increases will 
also impact on the group’s profit and we have therefore 
invested in our own housebuilding expertise as part of 
a deliberate strategy aimed at addressing the growth in 
construction costs as well as being part of an expansion 
programme. government initiatives – demand
supply
• this chronic undersupply underpins our sustainable 
business model for housebuilding, land trading and 
lettings operations. see page 40 for more on sustainability
