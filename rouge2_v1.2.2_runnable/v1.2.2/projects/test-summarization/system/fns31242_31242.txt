performance
benchmark
performance is benchmarked against 
the ftse all-share index (total return), 
representing the overall london market. this fee is subject to claw back and a high water mark and is capped 
at 4% of nav p.a. in the case of an absolute increase in nav per share; and 2% in the 
case of a decrease but with outperformance compared with the ftse all-share. the nav had lagged the index in 2016 and, as the 
performance fee is calculated on a cumulative basis, it can only be earned once the 
lag has been caught-up. dividend
the directors recommend a final dividend 
of 2.75p per share, to be paid on 19 june 
2018 to shareholders on the register as at 
4 may 2018. 
no final dividend was paid in 2017 , 
but an interim dividend of 2.0p per share 
in respect of the financial period ended 
on 31 december 2016 was paid on 
10 april 2017 . annual general meeting
the annual general meeting of the 
company will be held at the offices of 
grant thornton, 30 finsbury square, 
london ec2p 2yu on 6 june 2018 at 
12.00 noon. a total of 12,679,198 new 
shares were issued in 2017 , bringing the total number of shares issued during the era 
of phoenix management to 28,080,114. consequently, the market capitalisation of the 
company, which had been £51 .69m in january 2017 , finished the year at £88.34m. agm
a warm welcome is extended to shareholders to the agm to be held at 12 noon on 
6 june 2018 at the offices of grant thornton, 30 finsbury square, london ec2p 2yu. there’s a lot of 
talk about patient capital but it seems to me that the root of long term outperformance 
is the willingness to accept some periods of underperformance followed by (hopefully 
more significant) periods of outperformance based on core investment principles. rather, they 
will enable phoenix to implement more effectively their well-established investment 
philosophy. phoenix have assured the board that they will be cautious 
in making use of the expanded remit and the board recommends that shareholders 
approve the proposed changes. frostrow has an excellent reputation built on the provision of similar 
services to a select number of other investment trusts. the portfolio will remain relatively 
concentrated. the portfolio will be relatively concentrated. the portfolio will be relatively concentrated. alternatively, it could mean a focus on housebuilding companies 
or, indeed, specialist hobby brands – a niche within the consumer space arguably – 
which involves outfits such as hornby or latterly stanley gibbons. a new prospectus was 
published during the year to enable the continued issuance of new shares, both via 
small “tap-issues” and larger, more structured “placings” . phoenix reports in detail upon the company’s activities in the imr. lyndon has a great track record as a successful entrepreneur 
who competed with hornby. job no: 34360 proof event: 1 black line level: 0 park communications ltd alpine way london e6 6la

performance review
the performance for the year to end december 2017 was +18.5%, out-performing the 
benchmark ftse all share index by 5.4%. policy
phoenix asset management partners 
limited (phoenix) was appointed 
investment manager on 28 january 2016. 
phoenix currently seeks to achieve the 
objective by investing in a portfolio of uk 
listed equities. the board is seeking shareholder 
approval at the agm to increase the 
flexibility of the company to invest 
outside the uk and in unlisted securities. the key though are those investment principles that guide the stock selection. investment policy 
at this year’s agm, shareholders will be asked to vote on a resolution to amend 
aurora’s investment policy. two years of phoenix management
2017 was the second full year of phoenix management, which began with their being 
appointed investment manager in january 2016. aurora is managed under the same 
investment strategy as phoenix’s long standing, open-ended fund, the phoenix uk 
fund. i thought it might be useful to add some observations on our experience over the 
last few years of the investment management process and practices of phoenix. three 
key words stand out in my experience: patience, discipline and focus. get 
them right, wait to find the right business at the right price – as evidenced by the 
recent purchase of dignity after many years of patient research and monitoring – and 
hopefully you’ll reap a long-term reward. the exact number of 
individual holdings will vary over time but 
typically the portfolio will consist of 15 to 
20 holdings. one of the key features of the investment management agreement with phoenix 
is that they earn no management fees other than an annual performance fee, equal 
to one third of nav per share total returns in excess of the total return of the ftse 
all-share index. the share price of aurora traded at a premium to nav for substantially all of the 
period in question. the average premium for the year was 1 .5%, which was helpful in 
attracting new investors and to increase the size of the company through the issuance 
of new shares. why?
