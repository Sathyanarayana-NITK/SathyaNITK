glencore annual report 2017 looking ahead, while we maintain 
our long-term marketing adjusted 
ebit guidance range of $2.2 to 
$3.2 billion, a continuation of recent 
healthy marketing conditions would 
suggest a 2018 performance in the 
upper half of the range. chinese automakers are 
ramping up focus on the ev story, 
while a number have announced 
investment partnerships with the 
likes of ford, vw and general motors. it also encompasses our desire to

additional  
information our performance in 2017 is our strongest on 
record. chinese supply-side reform, aided by 
consistent environmental policy and 
compliance, positively affected a 
number of commodities during  
2017, including thermal coal, zinc 
and aluminium. going forward, those commodities 
where primary market balances are 
in deficit or trending towards deficit, 
such as zinc, copper, nickel and 
thermal coal should see positive  
price divergence versus potentially 
oversupplied markets. delivering sector-leading  
returns for shareholders
in 2017, glencore outperformed  
all its uk-listed major diversified 
mining peers, with shares up 41%. however, this may not necessarily be the country 
of the counterparty’s ultimate parent and/or final 
destination of the product, see note 2 of the  
financial statements. the percentage contributions are derived 
from the information included in note 2 of the 
financial statements. we believe our unrivalled 
positioning in “tier 1” commodities 
and “tier 1” assets will continue  
to create compelling value 
for shareholders. 1  cru “mobility and energy futures –

glencore annual report 2017 we believe that by being 
a better operator with a 
reputation for doing things the 
right way, we will be seen by 
our stakeholders as a partner 
of choice. we are achieving this 
through taking an approach 
of continuous improvement. we recognise that a robust 
and sufficiently flexible 
balance sheet contributes  
to the delivery of sustainable, 
long-term shareholder returns 
and ensures that glencore 
is well placed to withstand 
the cyclical nature of the 
natural resource industry. sadly, we recorded nine fatalities  
at our operations in 2017. our goal 
remains zero fatalities and there is 
unrelenting focus on ensuring leading 
practice at all our operations. performance in 2017
safework programme  
continued to progress our safework 
programme, an initiative that focuses on 
eliminating fatalities and serious injuries. regrettably, there were nine fatalities 
from nine incidents during the year. our ambition is to 
become a health and safety leader, 
and to create a workplace without 
fatalities, injuries or occupational 
diseases. progress during 2017 included the 
publication of our commitment to 
preventing the occurrence of modern 
slavery and human trafficking within 
our operations and supply chains,  
the release of our 2016 sustainability 
report, as well as updated reports on 
payments to governments and our 
climate change considerations paper. we aim to eliminate fatalities and provide 
a safe workplace. anti-bribery and corruption
offering, paying, soliciting or accepting 
bribes is unacceptable. our policies/procedures seek to 
ensure we comply with applicable 
sanctions, laws and regulations. 2 non-current assets are non-current assets excluding 
other investments, advances and loans and deferred 
tax assets. financial performance was strong 
in 2017, with adjusted ebitda of 
$14.8 billion, up 44% and net income 
attributable to equity holders 
increasing to $5.8 billion, from 
$1.4 billion in 2016, reflecting healthy 
commodity prices and the continued 
robust earnings contribution from  
our highly cash generative marketing 
and industrial businesses. marketing resilient again
marketing adjusted ebit was 
$3.0 billion in 2017, 3% higher  
than 2016, reflecting the benefits  
of continued supportive market 
conditions, volume growth in key 
market segments and a positive end 
to the year, eclipsing the $2.8 billion 
guidance provided during the 
investor update in early december. global automaker investments now 
total more than $90 billion, with at 
least $19 billion attributed to the u.s., 
$21 billion to china and $52 billion  
to germany. active at every 
stage of the commodity 
supply chain, we are 
uniquely diversified by 
geography, product and 
activity, maximising the 
value we create for our 
business and its diverse 
stakeholders
1  revenue by geographic destination is based on the 
country of incorporation of the sales counterparty. glencore’s balance sheet has never been 
stronger and our investment case, underpinned 
by our leading marketing and industrial asset 
businesses, has never been better 
capitalising on a strong  
operating environment
after an encouraging end to 2016, 
which saw commodities recover  
from cycle lows, positive momentum 
continued through 2017, resulting  
in prolonged outperformance of 
glencore’s key commodities versus 
the broader markets. strong economic performance 
in both major developing and 
developed markets has underpinned 
supportive commodity demand 
conditions. the electric vehicle 
upheaval continues to unfold, with 
the scale of market penetration  
and investment, by battery and 
automotive manufacturers and 
infrastructure players, adjusting 
progressively upwards.
