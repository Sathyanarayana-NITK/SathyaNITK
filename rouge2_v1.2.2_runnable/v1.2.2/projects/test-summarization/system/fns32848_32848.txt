• we have repeatedly proven our 
ability to acquire businesses, large 
and small, at the right price, and 
extract significant value from 
them for our shareholders. • we are strongly cash-
generative, providing more 
than adequate resources 
for organic investment and 
bolt-on acquisitions. it is our ability to secure 
sparingly-granted planning 
consents for new quarry 
reserves and extensions, and 
identify additional consented 
reserves to acquire, that ensures 
we continue to expand our 
mineral supplies. 08

as possible, quality and environmental 
controls are paramount. management of water, 
protection of wildlife, suppression of dust 
and noise and effective management 
of lorry movements are prerequisites 
for environmental licences and good 
community relations. although it is a more complex 
process, cement manufacturing requires 
the same mix of technical expertise, 
quality controls and operational 
efficiency, as well as adherence to 
even more stringent environmental 
compliance. this means 
that environmental 
and safety compliance 
are crucial components of our licence 
to operate and we take them extremely 
seriously. financially conservative  
with strong cashflow
• we have a strong balance 
sheet, with plenty of 
financial flexibility. core activities
(see pages 10 to 15 to learn more about how our core activities create value)
we operate our business 
with an uncompromising 
commitment to the safety of 
our colleagues and according 
to eight simple ‘golden rules’ 
which we believe give us our 
strong competitive advantage. these are granted sparingly and our 
success in obtaining them depends in 
large measure on maintaining good 
relationships with local authorities, 
landowners and – perhaps most 
importantly – the local communities 
which are affected by, and in some cases 
depend upon, our operations. we have 
an excellent track record of working with 
local stakeholders to develop our sites 
sensitively and ensure that the lives of 
the people, flora and fauna around them 
are subject to the minimum possible 
disruption. our 
most valuable assets are 
our 2,200 colleagues and 
around 750 million tonnes 
of mineral reserves and 
resources. our investment

over the three years to 2020. • aggregates, asphalt and ready-mixed 
concrete volumes are forecast to 
grow by three to five per cent over the 
same period. • the most buoyant sectors are 
predicted to be infrastructure and 
housing, which are expected to 
grow by a further 23 per cent and 
seven per cent respectively over the 
next three years. our 
operations are fully 
integrated, incorporating 
the country’s largest cement

on pages 16 to 17 breedon 
group overview
breedon is a business of significant scale, with the 
uk’s largest cement plant, two cementitious import 
terminals and a national network of 60 quarries, 
nearly 200 ready-mixed concrete plants, 26 asphalt 
plants and three concrete products plants. whether it is blasting, crushing 
and screening rock; extracting 
sand & gravel; or producing and 
importing high-grade cement, 
we do it as efficiently and  
cost-effectively as possible. our strategy is to 
continue growing through 
organic improvement and 
acquisition of businesses in 
the heavyside construction 
materials market. • with the exception of cement, these 
are all essentially local businesses, 
equipped to serve a very diverse 
range of customers, in a large 
number of local markets, with 
products which need to be delivered 
rapidly after production. • we benefit from significant 
economies of scale, with the 
advantages of vertical integration. • we have consistently demonstrated 
our ability to add to our reserves 
and resources through planning 
extensions, efficiency improvements 
and reduction of waste. together these 
account for the majority of breedon’s 
end-use sales. breedon has always 
prided itself on staying local and being 
easy to do business with, which means 
we have no national call centres or 
centralised shipping for our downstream 
products, but instead a network of local 
businesses with an uncompromising 
commitment to outstanding service. as always, there were marked regional 
variations, with some parts of the uk 
significantly outperforming others. our midlands heartland saw particularly 
healthy growth in volumes of some 
products, along with parts of the north-
west of england and wales. 119.4
