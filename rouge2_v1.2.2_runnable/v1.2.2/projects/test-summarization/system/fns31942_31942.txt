strategy 
the group provides innovative sensor systems for various complex applications and operates two 
principal businesses, sawsense and translogik. sawsense designs and develops surface acoustic wave (or “saw”) sensor devices that can be used to 
measure torque, pressure and/or temperature in harsh, restricted or demanding environments to very high 
accuracy. this world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value 
custom applications through to high volume mass markets. translogik designs and markets a range of tyre pressure monitoring systems (“tpms”), products and 
services for heavy duty off road vehicles (particularly mine-haul trucks), commercial truck and bus as well 
as passenger cars. a more detailed review of the financial year is provided in the chairman’s statement and the chief 
executives report. in addition to the kpi’s the statement of financial position and cash flow analysis are 
reviewed at monthly board meetings. a statement of the directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 23. 
below is a brief description of the role of the board and its committees. the board 
 
the board, which presently consists of three executive and two non-executive directors, meets regularly 
throughout the year and receives timely information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it 
to discharge its duties. the total 
loss attributable to shareholders was £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) resulting in a net loss per ordinary 
share of 22.84 pence (2016: earnings of 12.90 pence). the board do not recommend payment of a 
dividend (2016: nil). net cash balances at 30 june 2017 were £2.52m (2016: £3.65m). the pre-tax loss (before discontinued operations) totalled 
£2.16m (2016: profit £1.60m which included the license fee of £3.04m before costs and £2.76m after costs 
and an adjusted loss of £1.16m before the net license fee). 1

chairman’s statement (continued) 
as original equipment manufacturers (oems) seek ever more data on a real-time basis to optimise the 
performance of their products, accurate and frequent measurement becomes increasingly important. this work culminated in the september 2016 launch of the itrack ii system. transense technologies plc

chairman’s statement (continued) 
new joint brokers  
the company announced the appointment of beaufort securities limited ("beaufort") as joint broker to 
the company to improve the service available to the large group of private investors interested in 
transense. this increase in expenditure reflects new product support and the commercial and 
marketing activity within translogik to launch itrack ii and deliver effective pre-contract engagement with 
a number of key customers for this system. the group intends to continue to commercialise sensor technologies by working closely with global 
partners in order to build value for shareholders through the generation and distribution of net income, 
and/or the return of capital on realisation. the translogik product offerings are continually evolving with the focus on providing a comprehensive 
service to clients in the mining and truck industry and this strategy has resulted in the successful launch 
of the itrack ii system in september 2016.

saw sensing in global industries 
 
sensor technology is widely used in virtually every industrial application across a broad range of industries, 
contributing to many billions of dollars in revenue. the associated 
benefits in tyre life management were evident, and were initially viewed as a means of payback for the 
improved safety performance achieved. information on directors' emoluments is as follows:

remuneration report 
remuneration policy 
the remuneration policy is to ensure that all staff, including the executive directors, are adequately 
motivated and rewarded in relation to companies of similar size and type. revenue from continuing operations was steady compared with the prior 
year, and the net loss for the year came in line with the board’s expectations. financial results and condition  
revenues for the current year amounted to £2.00m, compared with £2.08m in the prior year (stated before 
the intellisaw related license fee of £3.04m). administrative expenses increased to £3.32m from £2.54m 
in the prior year. the pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year was £2.16m compared with a profit of £1.59m 
and loss in the prior year adjusted for the effects of the net intellisaw licence fee of £1.17m. the cash resources do 
however remain strong moving into 
fy18 and the board exert tight 
controls on overheads and monitor 
cash flow regularly and do not 
presently foresee any immediate 
requirement for raising further 
funds. the company continues the development of non-contact batteryless sensors and their electronic 
interrogation systems for measuring pressure, temperature and torque in automotive applications and 
extending that to various, non-automotive, industrial applications with regards the electronic interrogation. the prior year share price has 
been adjusted to reflect the 50:1 share consolidation referred to in note 23. 
share based payment option schemes 
the remuneration committee is responsible for the operation and administration of the company’s 
udsos and emi schemes. overview of our audit approach 
• overall group materiality: £60,000, which represents 3% of the 
group’s revenue. regular reviews are undertaken to 
assess the nature and magnitude of risks faced and the manner in which they may be mitigated. these procedures include 
an annual review of the significant risks faced by the group and an assessment of their potential impact 
and likelihood of occurrence. the board is satisfied with the effectiveness of internal controls but, by 
their very nature, these procedures can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. an internal audit function 
is therefore considered unnecessary.
