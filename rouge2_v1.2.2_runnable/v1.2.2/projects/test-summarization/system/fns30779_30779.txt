our customers are at the heart of what we do at 
national express. the board believes that this gives a more comparable year-on-year indication of the 
operating performance of the group and allows users of the financial statements  
to understand management’s key performance measures. with revenue and profit both increasing 
markedly and being converted to strong free cash flow, i firmly believe 
that under dean’s leadership we have established a sustainable 
model of growth. it is particularly pleasing that these group results have been delivered 
through growth across all of our internationally diversified business. in 2017, we made nine acquisitions: 
three in north america, three in spain and three 
in switzerland. there are different models for this,  
with examples ranging from the deregulated 
markets of our uk bus and coach operations, 
through the concessions and franchises of 
spain, morocco and german rail, to the school 
bus and transit contracts of north america. this is supported by a trend towards market 
liberalisation, such as european union directives 
focused on opening up bus and rail networks. liberalisation of the german and spanish 
rail and nordic rail and bus markets present 
opportunities for growth. from our industry-leading on-demand scheduling technology at 
ecolane, through our pioneering use of smart lytx drivecam safety 
cameras, to our sophisticated customer pricing and payment 
methods (such as revenue management systems) national express 
has sought to invest to embrace the opportunities at an early stage. cost saving is 
increasingly a factor too, through recognition  
of the superior efficiency of privately  
operated services. our response
we look to offer our customers easy to use, safe, 
reliable and great value services where we will 
continue to look to launch new products and 
services to meet our customers’ needs and 
aspirations. technology and innovation are playing their part, 
with travel apps providing real-time information 
as well as customised targeted offers helping  
to generate incremental demand for journeys on 
public transport. www.nationalexpressgroup.com 1,745

dear fellow shareholder
introduction and overview
i am delighted that national express has again delivered another  
year of such strong growth. dividend
it is with this in mind that the board has again recommended a 10% 
increase in the final dividend, bringing the full year dividend to 13.51p. opportunity 
the current size of the european public transport 
market is estimated to be approximately €150 
billion*. (*oecd data.) whether they are fare paying 
passengers, transport authorities or school boards, 
the mission is the same: to relentlessly meet their 
expectations. as a leading international transport company, we 
provide a crucial service by conveniently and safely 
connecting people to jobs, education, shopping  
and leisure in an environmentally responsible way, 
through value fares. as dean again sets out in his report, the emerging 
urban growth model in geneva and in major cities in north america 
has been driven by our recent acquisitions. opportunity
north america continues to grow, while the 
spanish economy has strengthened over the  
last couple of years, with levels of tourism also 
very strong – demand for public transport is 
likely to improve further as the economy grows 
and employment levels continue to rise. see reconciliation 
on page 21.

improved access to city centre locations, such 
as priority bus lanes for environmentally friendly 
transport and lower congestion. move to electric 
and hybrid buses to lower emissions. our response
we work hard with our alliance partners, 
transport for west midlands and the metro 
mayor, to deliver more environmentally friendly 
transport, easing congestion with faster journey 
times from priority bus lanes and lowering 
emissions with euro six compliant buses. although levels of transportation 
and mobility remain relatively stable through  
the economic cycle, periods of gdp growth 
generate additional volume demand and  
pricing benefit. although levels of transportation

national express has a track record of generating significant  
cash flow from its operations.
