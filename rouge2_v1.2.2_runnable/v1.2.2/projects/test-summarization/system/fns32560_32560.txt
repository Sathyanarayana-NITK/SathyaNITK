1 as previously guided, this year we are reporting on the 53 weeks to 4 march 
2017, with an extra week added to ensure that the year-end date stays close 
to the end of february. we are all about democratising fashion and are size inclusive, 
focusing on the needs of underserved customer groups – size 
20+ and age 50+. championing body diversity 
in the fashion industry
we are a truly size and age agnostic 
fashion retailer; whatever a customer’s 
size or age, we aim to make them 
feel amazing in what they wear. we create unique 
silhouettes, rather than scaling 
patterns; we use real bodies, rather 
than static mannequins; and we design 
to fit – a unique, age appropriate  
point of view for our consumer. we understand 
shape and create fashionable 
collections that fit. we have 
also significantly changed  
our processes, particularly in  
buying, merchandising and 
marketing. our trading agility, made  
possible by the transformative 
changes we have made, is  
yielding results and is key to 
thriving in a world changing 
faster than ever before. this attitude differs significantly to 
the fashion industry as a whole. more detail p38

further delivery improvements
we extended our cut-off for next day 
delivery by an hour to 10pm. these new tools give us the 
ability to forecast at the individual item 
level, improving our availability and 
reducing markdown. we planned 
months in advance to ensure that we 
could offer customers fantastic deals 
whilst earning an improved margin 
ourselves. this allows 
brands access to a new, growing 
customer base at relatively low risk, and 
gives our customers an even greater 
choice of products. this allows us to further improve 
our brand awareness and gain new 
customers. in order to provide a meaningful comparison with last 
year’s 52 week period, all p&l financial movements are reported on a 52 week 
basis, excluding the 53rd week, unless otherwise stated. a detailed 
comparison of the 53 weeks and 52 weeks results are set out on page 44. all 
second half p&l financial movements relate to the 26 week period, excluding 
the 27th week, unless otherwise stated. all balance sheet figures are reported 
as at the year-end date and cash flow figures are for the 53 week period. sales of these lines significantly 
exceeded expectations, up 72% versus 
comparable lines in the previous year. – simply be revenue up 9.9%
