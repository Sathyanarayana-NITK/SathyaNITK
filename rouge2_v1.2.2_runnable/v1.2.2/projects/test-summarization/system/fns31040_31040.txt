performance throughout 2017 has been 
very strong, with a 6.3% increase in 
revenue to £411.7m and a 6.0% increase 
in underlying operating profit at £72.6m. underlying 
operating margin was robust at 17.6%, 
despite continued input cost inflation, 
and underlying diluted earnings per share 
increased by 10.1% to 27.2p per share. net debt continued to reduce to 1.6 times 
ebitda compared with 1.9 times for the 
prior year. polypipe’s focus on value addition through 
engineered solutions, its above-market growth and 
its commitment to investment leverages an existing 
operational footprint to generate incremental 
profitability, which allows polypipe to deliver a 
strong and resilient financial performance. this 
broad exposure across the construction sectors provides a counter-cyclical balance 
to the more volatile peaks and troughs of the new-build cycle, and provides 
even further opportunity for polypipe to provide effective solutions to new and 
emerging legislation, substitute legacy building materials, and therefore to deliver 
above-market growth. in combining all of the above, polypipe 
continues to maintain the market 
leading position for creating plastic pipe 
technology and sustainable products that 
are intelligently engineered. sustainable

the demand for comprehensive 
water management solutions 
continues to rise. through constant 
innovation and focused research and 
development, polypipe is uniquely  
positioned to offer solutions that help 
deal with the pressures placed on urban 
environments, existing infrastructure  
and natural resources. our purpose
polypipe harnesses the knowledge of its expert staff 
to develop a deep understanding of the market 
sectors the company serves. in addition to a core 
offer of drainage, plumbing and heating, polypipe 
is able to offer access to one of the largest water 
management product portfolios, offering solutions 
to even the most demanding of water management 
infrastructure projects. plus, the dedicated teams in 
our ventilation businesses work directly with m&e 
contractors and end-customers, which allows them 
to focus their efforts on new product development 
to keep them at the forefront of low-energy and 
carbon efficient ventilation technology. the solution 
was retrofitted to the existing area with 
minimal disruption to local residents to provide 
long-lasting flood protection. at the same time there is 
a slight demographic impact on rm&i 
particularly among older homeowners in 
certain areas who prefer to release equity 
from pensions and stay and improve 
rather than move. with storm events and water shortages 
occurring more frequently due to 
environmental change, polypipe’s 
engineered solutions help its customers 
ensure their developments are resilient. with 
average air temperatures projected to 
rise significantly over the coming decades 
due to climate change, and the ‘urban 
heat island effect’ likely to exacerbate 
the intensity of heatwaves in cities, the 
convergence of low energy heating 
and ventilation solutions that maintain 
comfortable internal temperatures and 
help avoid overheating all year round 
becomes increasingly important. polypipe supplied a complete 
prefabricated solution using polystorm 
geocellular tanks, together with pipework, 
manholes and catchpits all manufactured 
off-site. odours and contaminants in the air. as thermoplastic pipes are 
inherently lighter in weight 
than legacy materials, they 
are quicker and easier to 
install. polypipe produces 
pipes and fittings utilising 
recycled materials where 
appropriate and all products 
are recyclable at the end 
of their useful life. the final design saw the installation 
of two polystorm geocellular tanks at a depth 
of 3.2 metres, under two resident owned car 
parks on the linnet rise site, providing 366m

output trends
over the next two years, overall 
construction output is forecast to remain 
broadly flat in 2018, rising by only 
0.2%, before growth of 1.7% in 2019, 
driven primarily by growth in private 
housing and infrastructure. as 
well as managing this growth, the group 
has also seen a number of key leadership 
changes during the year, including the 
retirement of david hall in october 2017 
following 12 years as ceo, and the 
promotion of martin payne from cfo to 
ceo following david’s retirement. glen 
sabin was promoted to the role of chief 
operating officer and appointed to the 
board in october 2017, and the company 
secretarial function was also brought in-
house following the appointment of emma 
versluys as company secretary. paul james 
joined the company and board as chief 
financial officer on 5 march 2018, and i 
believe that the executive management 
team is now at full complement following 
this period of change and well placed to 
drive the group’s strategy forwards. in this regard, the group announced on 
31 january 2018 that it had entered into 
advanced negotiations to dispose of its 
french subsidiary following a review of 
the strategic overlap between the uk and 
french business. polypipe group plc

polypipe annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 december 2017 welcome to
polypipe is one of europe’s 
largest manufacturers 
of piping systems, water 
and climate management 
systems, delivering 
engineered solutions that 
enable a sustainable built 
environment. polypipe has an established market position, 
spanning the residential, commercial, civils 
and infrastructure, and public non-housing 
sectors in the uk and selected markets 
around the world. in this way, polypipe’s sales growth has consistently 
outperformed the construction market. despite the continued economic 
and political uncertainty that has prevailed 
since the eu referendum and a mixed uk 
construction market performance, our end 
markets continue to perform well, with the 
group growing uk revenue significantly 
ahead of the uk construction market. what we do
polypipe develops engineered solutions for 
construction projects, including some of the most 
prestigious buildings and infrastructure schemes, 
around a core offer of plastic piping systems. based on a core offer of plastic piping, supported by 
complete system performance design, incorporating 
engineered in-house manufactured fittings and 
ancillaries, polypipe is uniquely placed to offer a 
differentiated total solution to those from other 
plastic pipe manufacturers. 01 our solutions
polypipe suds solution 
enhanced flood 
protection and ensured 
minimal intrusion into 
residents’ usable space
the lack of capacity in the existing highway 
drainage network placed many properties 
in the residential area of linnet rise at risk 
of flooding. in the mid-90s, this proposition evolved 
to combine these discrete products 
into performance systems, such as 
pushfit plumbing, for example.
