outside our 
campuses, we own a number of high quality 
standalone buildings in well-connected and 
well-managed locations. our london office 
campus approach and multi-let retail centre 
focus has proved to be a real differentiator  
in this respect, creating not only outstanding 
buildings but enabling us to make substantial 
improvements to the overall environments  
in which they sit. we are proactively 
designing new buildings with a focus on health, 
wellbeing and productivity of the consumers  
and employees who will use those buildings. this underpins our  
focus on our multi-let retail properties and  
our london campuses which are increasingly 
mixed use. for more information

presentation of financial information
the group financial statements are prepared under 
ifrs where the group’s interests in joint ventures and 
funds are shown as a single line item on the income 
statement and balance sheet and all subsidiaries  
are consolidated at 100%. management considers the business principally on  
a proportionally consolidated basis when setting  
the strategy, determining annual priorities, making 
investment and financing decisions and reviewing 
performance. for us in very broad 
terms, we considered the potential impact  
on consumer confidence affecting our retail 
business and what the result could do  
to business confidence, in particular the  
choice of global organisations to locate  
large parts of their businesses in london. significantly, valuation 
performance in the second half was stronger 
than the first. last year i commented that macro-economic and 
political risks had affected the ftse 100. shares  
in real estate have been significantly impacted by 
uncertainty. as a largely domestically focused 
business operating in sterling, uk reits are more 
exposed to the implications of brexit on the uk 
economy than the majority of the ftse 100. 
experience also shows that gaps between 
share price and reported values expand during 
times of uncertainty and there continues to  
be a wide range of views on the potential  
impact of the uk’s decision to leave europe 
on our markets. w w w . w w w . w w w . the queen’s award
