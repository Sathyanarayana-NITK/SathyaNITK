12 overview: a position of 
strength in the industry
i am pleased to report that playtech enjoyed 
another year of operational success and as 
a result finds itself in a position of strength 
at the end of 2017. despite headwinds 
in regulated revenue in h1 2017 and 
the disruptions in unregulated markets 
experienced in the second half of 2017, the 
strength of the underlying playtech business 
was demonstrated by the 18% revenue 
growth for the group at constant currency. this will continue to drive the improvement 
in the quality of earnings we saw in 2017, 
with regulated revenue now reaching 
54% of group revenue in 2017 and set to 
continue to grow. founded in 1999 and listed on  
the main market of the london stock exchange,  
playtech has offices in 17 countries with  
c. 5,000 employees. in this section we discuss 
the way the board runs itself and its 
committees, and how decisions are 
taken at playtech. integrated with the strength of 
the casino vertical, via playtech’s single 
platform, we have already seen the 
sports division win new landmark clients, 
including leading portuguese operator
