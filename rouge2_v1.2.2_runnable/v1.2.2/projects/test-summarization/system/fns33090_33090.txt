our aim
to be the leading dominant community shopping centre reit  
offering investors:
•	 exposure	to	a	high	quality	portfolio	of	strong	assets,	
dominant	in	their	immediate	catchment
•	 a	highly	attractive	dividend	yield	
•	 potential	to	generate	significant	income	and	nav	growth	
through	identified	asset	management	initiatives
•	 experienced	and	expert	team	with	a	proven	track	record	of	
creative	asset	management	via	a	scalable	platform
•	 security	through	competitively	priced	debt	funding	
•	 benefit	of	c&r	driving	sector	consolidation	opportunities
look out for these icons:
	 	 more	information	on	a	particular	topic	
can	be	found	within	the	report. the	group	is	now	well	positioned	to	
achieve	this	objective	based	on	its	
exposure	to	a	high	quality	portfolio	of	
strong	assets,	dominant	in	their	immediate	
catchment,	which	offer	the	potential	to	
generate	significant	income	and	nav	
growth	based	on	a	programme	of	exciting	
asset	management	initiatives	across	the	
portfolio. performance overview
the	timing	of	the	mall	acquisition	means	
that	both	existing	shareholders	as	well	
as	those	who	participated	in	the	£165	
million	firm	placing	and	placing	and	
open	offer	have	been	able	to	benefit	
from	the	upswing	in	investment	markets	
which	has	gathered	momentum	as	the	
year	has	progressed. it	is	the	resilience	of	
these	assets	and	their	ability	to	respond	
to	changing	consumer	behaviour	and	
a	market	increasingly	dominated	by	the	
internet,	retailers’	requirements	and	click
