in 2017 we sold an estimated 
70 million tests. as 
a result of these actions, the total number of 
potential shares has reduced by nearly 6%. gross margins have improved 
at a greater rate than the increase in sales. sales of hemo 
control (sold in the usa as hemopoint h2) 
have built on the strong growth in 2016, rising a 
further 7%, while diaspect revenues have risen 
by a further 23%. results overview
the chief executive’s and finance director’s 
statements contain a review of the year and an 
overview of the financial performance of the 
group. board
all of the board members have served 
throughout the year. non-executive directors 
have continued to waive their standard 
director’s fees, however as each has performed 
considerable amounts of work for the group in 
addition to their duties as directors, they have 
been paid an appropriate bonus. christopher is a member 
of the audit committee and chairs the remuneration committee. strategy
although glucose testing is the most commonly used method of determining glycaemic control 
within diabetics, hba1c is the accepted long term barometer of patient wellbeing and their 
compliance with the treatment regimes. senspoint is awaiting ce marking whilst the product team continue to work with key opinion 
leaders to educate the future target market on the need for a protocol in the use of lactate in 
obstetric medicine. after considerable deliberation and discussion 
with our professional advisors, we were unable 
to proceed with our plan to split out the central 
laboratory business in a tax efficient manner. the calculation of this non-gaap 
measure is shown on the face of the income 
statement. our point-of-care (poc) products, most of which are designed and manufactured in germany, 
have a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability and accuracy from professionals working 
in diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine. the ekf central laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured 
at premises near san antonio, texas. clinical chemistry reagents are sold for use on open channel 
systems or on ekf’s own brand of analysers. ekf life sciences, based in elkhart, indiana, manufactures diagnostic enzymes and contracted 
custom products for use in medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and industry. this approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a 
percentage of organic growth each year. ekf believes that this portfolio can provide it with a competitive advantage to grow its market 
share. strategy
ekf’s maternal and women’s health business unit has seen steady growth since it was created. in parallel there is a slowly building commercial interest in this market in europe. we have 
discontinued a number of the marginal former 
sti products. exceptional items relate to provisions made 
and costs incurred in the closure of the polish 
manufacturing site, the increase in the fair 
value of the warranty claim associated with the 
acquisition of ekf-diagnostic gmbh, which is 
attributable to the increase in the company’s 
share price during the year, and to the benefit at 
fair value of the shares released to ekf from an 
escrow account associated with the acquisition 
of selah genomics, inc.
operating profit and adjusted earnings 
before interest tax and depreciation
the group made an operating profit of £4.7m, 
having made a small loss of £0.3m in 2016. this 
reflects the considerable efforts made in the 
last two years to reduce costs and improve 
efficiency. we continue to consider that adjusted 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, share-based payments 
and exceptional items (adjusted ebitda) is 
a better measure of progress because the 
board believes it gives clearer comparability 
of operating performance between periods. of the increase in 
adjusted ebitda of £3.2m, £0.6m is attributable 
to the effect of more favourable exchange 
rates, with the remainder being attributable to 
improved underlying performance. the acquisition of diaspect and separation t echnology in 2014 allowed ekf to offer an unparalleled 
range of hemoglobin and hematocrit point of care blood analysers manufactured in germany and 
the usa. strategy
the ekf diagnostics portfolio of hemoglobin and hematocrit analysers is unique within the point 
of care diagnostics sector. in  2017 ekf sold more than 22 million tests for the diaspect tm range, and 19 million tests for 
hemo control and hemopoint® h2

point-of-care: hemoglobin analysers
product portfolio
the hemoglobin analysers product range within ekf diagnostics, is the largest in terms of revenues 
and the size of the installed base. in june 2017, 21.6m share 
options which had been granted to employees 
and others were cancelled at the election of the 
holders, in return for payments totalling £1.5m. in september 2017, court and shareholder 
approval were received for a capital reduction, 
allowing us to create distributable reserves 
through the write-off of the company’s share 
premium account, and to buy back up to 15% of 
the company’s ordinary shares. the poc business is built around a large installed base of analysers each of which generates a 
regular demand for tests, often for the entire life cycle of the analyser. sales are primarily focused around two markets – public health initiatives such as anaemia screening 
programmes, and private practices where the cost of testing is paid for by an insurance company 
or the patient. to approach these markets ekf has two distinct strategies: firstly, oem partnerships with 
international distributor/manufacturers such as fresenius kabi; and secondly agreements with 
smaller distributors who are focused on the public health opportunities within their own countries. a similar approach is 
being used for procalcitonin (pct) in europe where ekf has undertaken awareness activity using 
key opinion leaders in target markets. richard evans
