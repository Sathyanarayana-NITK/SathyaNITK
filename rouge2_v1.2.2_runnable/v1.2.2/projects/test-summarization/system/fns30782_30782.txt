strategic report our sustainability 
priorities aligned with 
our 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth. in line with our progressive dividend policy 
and underpinned by our excellent cash 
generative earnings model and strong 
balance sheet, we have announced a full 
year dividend of 71.3p, an increase of 
14.3% and are increasing the dividend 
payout ratio to circa 50% from 2018. 
the products and trade related divisions, 
which represent 94% of the group's 
earnings, delivered excellent performance 
with organic revenue growth of 4.8% at 
constant rates while, as expected, trading 
conditions remained challenging in the 
resources related division. (this later becomes 
the electrical 
testing laboratories 
or etl – a mark 
that intertek still 
applies today)
