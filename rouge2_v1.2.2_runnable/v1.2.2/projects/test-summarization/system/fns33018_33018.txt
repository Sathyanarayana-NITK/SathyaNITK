looking statements
in order to utilise the ‘safe harbour’ provisions of
the us private securities litigation reform act
1995, we are providing the following cautionary
statement: this annual report and form 20-f
2002 contains certain forward-looking
statements about astrazeneca. although we
believe our expectations are based on
reasonable assumptions, any forward-looking
statements may be influenced by factors that
could cause actual outcomes and results to be
materially different from those predicted. we
identify the forward-looking statements by using
the words ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’,
‘intends’ and similar expressions in such
statements. in addition, the
board has nominated sir peter bonfield as
the senior non-executive director contact for
investors wishing to raise any potential
corporate governance issues. this
work is led by a cross-functional, cross-
territorial cr committee which reports to
dame bridget ogilvie, the non-executive
director with responsibility for overseeing cr
within astrazeneca. during the year , lars ramqvist retired from his
role as non-executive director of
astrazeneca and we welcomed john
buchanan as a new non-executive director. in june, claes wilhelmsson retired as an
executive director of astrazeneca and åke
stavling stepped down as an executive
director at the end of january 2003. claes
and åke played important roles in the
formation and integration of astrazeneca and
undertook key responsibilities for r&d and
business development respectively . statements of competitive position
except as otherwise stated, market information 
in this annual report and form 20-f 2002
regarding the position of our business or
products relative to its or their competition is

12 months ended 30 september 2002, or the
month of november 2002, obtained from ims
health, a leading supplier of statistical data to
the pharmaceutical industry. statements of growth rates
except as otherwise stated, growth rates in 
this annual report and form 20-f 2002 are
given at constant exchange rates (cer). on average, one quality candidate drug now
entering pre-clinical development each month. during the year , we made good progress in
further developing our overall corporate
responsibility (cr) programme. snda submitted in the us for use
of seroquel in the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar disorder . reports on the incidence of
interstitial lung disease in seriously ill lung
cancer patients receiving iressa in japan,
whilst not proven to be linked to the
treatment, led the japanese ministry of
health, labour and welfare to introduce strict
precautions in its use and specialist
supervision of patients. growth through key products
growth of our business will be driven by:

operational review
globally , in 2002, the pharmaceutical industry
maintained good annual growth of 10% (at
constant us dollar exchange rates). nexium offers more effective acid inhibition
than all other ppis and, in the treatment of
reflux oesophagitis, provides healing and
symptom relief in more patients and in a
shorter period of time than losec or
lansoprazole. important factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements, certain of which are
beyond our control, include, among other
things: the loss or expiration of patents,
marketing exclusivity or trade marks; exchange
rate fluctuations; the risk that r&d will not yield
new products that achieve commercial success;
the impact of competition, price controls and
price reductions; taxation risks; the risk of
substantial product liability claims; the impact 
of any failure by third parties to supply materials 
or services; the risk of delay to new product
launches; the difficulties of obtaining and
maintaining governmental approvals for
products; and the risk of environmental
liabilities. over 23,500 patients treated since launch, reflecting high level of
unmet need. > supply and manufacturing effectiveness enhanced, with significant lead time
reductions on several key products, supported by improved process reliability . > corporate responsibility management standards issued, strengthening the
platform for ensuring consistent and appropriate behaviour worldwide. we’ re
