predominately buy profiles from a single supplier, which in turn 
creates a stable and loyal customer base. by influencing

business model:
recycling, manufacturing and own 
distribution network
we are a leading manufacturer of rigid and foam 
pvc profiles. • expand our branch network. as a result, we reported adjusted profit before tax of 
£24.5 million, up 1% on last year. reported profit before  
tax of £23.7 million is down 0.7% on last year. cash conversion remains solid, with underlying operating 
cash flow of £28.8 million (2016: £32.2 million) driving a 
reduction in net debt to £14.5 million (31 december 2016: 
£20.3 million). the board proposes a final dividend of 6.0 pence  
per share, resulting in total dividends for the year of  
9.0 pence, representing growth of 6%. • explore potential bolt-on acquisitions. • studioglide bi-fold door 
a new alluminium bi-fold door with improved 
opening and closing mechanism which 
complements our existing product designs 
and is now in production with several of our 
trade frame fabricators. • modus and skypod continued improvement 
range extension for these excellent products. 11

explore potential bolt-on acquisitions 
in february 2017, we completed the acquisition of 
security hardware, a supplier of locks and hardware 
primarily to the rmi market. new build fabricators supply and install the 
products they make for house builders. commercial 
fabricators supply and install products used in applications 
such as office space and education facilities. finally, retail 
fabricators make products for sale via their own retail 
operation, which may be a large national business, or a 
small company servicing the local community. most of 
eurocell’s customers are trade frame fabricators, although 
new build is becoming increasingly important. our recycling operation helps to 
lower material costs and improve production 
stability. profitability was solid, having been impacted by a subdued 
rmi market, especially in the second half, and higher raw 
material cost inflation. at the 
conclusion of this process, we reaffirmed that our overall 
objective remains to deliver sustainable growth in 
shareholder value by increasing sales and profits at above 
our market level growth rates. we expect the significant investments now made in 
our specifications teams and in expanding the branch 
network will deliver further gains in market share. progress with strategic priorities
• gaining market share – organic sales growth of 6% for profiles and 9% for building plastics. • increasing use of recycled pvc in manufactured products – 17% in 2017 (2016: 14%). • completed acquisition – security hardware in february 2017.
