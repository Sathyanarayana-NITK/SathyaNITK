revenue for the year 
was up 9% at £2,793m (2016: £2,562m), 
with adjusted profit before tax up 46% 
to £66.1m (2016: £45.3m). dividend
the total dividend for the year has been 
increased by 29% to 45.0p per share 
(2016: 35.0p), which includes a proposed 
increase in the final dividend of 32% to 
29.0p per share (2016: 22.0p), reflecting 
the improved result in the year and the 
board’s confidence in the future 
prospects of the group. as a result of the 
reduced affordability of new homes, 
more people are turning to renting, 
and the private rented sector market 
is projected to grow from 19% to 25% 
of all uk households by 2020 (ft). the increase on the previous year 
was the largest since the 12 months to 
mid-1947, although the annual growth 
rate at 0.8% is in line with the average 
since 2005. the population is also getting 
older, with 18% aged 65 and over (ons). four macroeconomic trends 
will support long-term growth in 
the group: the housing shortage; 
investment in infrastructure; 
population growth; and pressure 
on the public sector to achieve 
savings in managing their assets. we target growing markets 
that match our expertise. aligned to these values, our 
group-wide total commitments 
to being a responsible business 
support our strategy and are 
measured against performance 
targets. we measure our performance 
using financial and non-financial 
performance indicators related to 
our strategic objectives. all reports can be downloaded from our website at
