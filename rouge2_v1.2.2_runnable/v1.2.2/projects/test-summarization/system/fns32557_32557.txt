context
the market
the uk economy has been stronger than 
anticipated since the european union 
referendum in june 2016. conditions have 
remained supportive for uk consumers, 
with wage growth remaining higher than 
inflation. consistent with recent years, 
the main beneficiaries of these conditions 
have been higher ticket discretionary 
categories such as eating out, car sales 
and holidays. however, the picture is changing now, as the impact of 
the devaluation of sterling and a higher oil price filter 
through to food, general merchandise, clothing and 
fuel prices and the gap between inflation and wage 
growth narrows. read more about our approach to managing costs
