chairman’s 
statement
our core objective is to grow 
shareholder value and we  
will do this by developing a business 
capable of delivering long term, 
sustainable and growing cash flows, 
achieved through a disciplined 
approach to deployment of capital 
and a rigorous focus on execution. 2017 has proved a challenging year for 
northgate with a number of factors 
impacting the group’s performance. we have taken a number of 
actions to address this and these are set out 
in detail in the ceo’s report. (m) %

source: based on research conducted by oc&c using data from msi, bvrla, dft, simi. during the year it became increasingly 
clear that, notwithstanding the competitive 
environment within which northgate 
operates, there are significant opportunities 
for our business which need to be developed 
in a consistent and focused manner. our spanish 
and irish businesses performed well and 
continue to make excellent progress with 
good growth in vehicles on hire (“voh”) 
and with the potential for further growth 
in voh, revenues and profits. this provides good scope  
to further expand our business, including  
our move into term hire, and also to return  
cash to our shareholders in the form of 
increasing dividends. dividend
the group remains in a strong financial 
position, with healthy cash generation and 
a robust balance sheet. performance
the group’s underlying profit before tax was 
£75m which represented a 10% decline on 
the previous year’s £83m. the performance 
of our uk business was disappointing with 
underlying operating profits declining by 
£11.5m which represented a fall of 21% on 
the prior year. voh grew 
by 2,200 in spain and ireland; in the uk 
there was a decline of 2,900 which was 
particularly disappointing as we had 
anticipated a steadily improving pick up 
during the second half of the year. this underpins our 
progressive dividend policy and the board’s 
continued confidence in the outlook for 
the group means we are proposing a full 
year dividend of 17.3p, an increase of 8% 
compared to the 2016 full year dividend of 
16.0p. this means a final proposed dividend 
of 11.6p (2016 – 10.9p). read more in our managing risk section

q&a with  
the ceo
kevin bradshaw
what are the three key things you  
have learned in your first five months 
with northgate? this gives a full year dividend cover of 2.7x 
on underlying earnings, in line with our 
intention to keep cover in the range of  
3.75x to 2.5x. our touchstones will be cash 
flow and returns on investment. there is good demand for our 
product and services and we intend to 
harness this effectively through marketing 
clear customer propositions and ensuring we 
meet or exceed our customers’ expectations. northgateplc.com    stock code: ntg 25361.02     13-6-17   proof four
