why 
argentina? argentina is a net 
importer of both oil and 
gas. unconventional oil and gas 
has the potential to transform the future of 
argentina’s economy. the fiscal deficit 
is being tackled and unemployment is 
gradually reducing. the oil industry is at the 
forefront of this trend, with its ability 
to rapidly improve the country’s balance 
of trade. increased domestic oil 
and gas production will reduce the 
reliance on expensive oil and gas imports 
and will lead to job creation in argentina, 
driving further economic prosperity. scale and upside in argentina

the evaluation of the vaca muerta 
shale formation is well under way in the 
puesto rojas area in mendoza province 
with five wells targeting the formation 
in 2017. a number of wells have also 
been drilled in the agrio and chachao 
formations at the nearby cerro pencal 
area, also demonstrating the potential 
for unconventional development. a full 
3d seismic survey in southern puesto 
rojas is being processed and interpreted 
to plan for future drilling. international oil companies 
investing in argentina, and specifically 
in the vaca muerta shale, include 
exxonmobil, bp, shell, total, equinor 
(previously statoil), chevron, sinopec, 
petronas and schlumberger. during the year, i was appointed

2014. prices have increased further 
through may and breached the

daily production fell from approximately 
512,000 bpd in 2016 to approximately 
479,000 bpd in 2017, a decrease of 
approximately 6.4% year on year. phoenix currently accounts for 
approximately 1.6% of total oil production 
in argentina. in neuquén province, a significant vaca 
muerta opportunity exists at the mata 
mora and corralera concessions that are 
proximate to and on trend with the most 
prolific vaca muerta producing licences. the vaca 
muerta is the only commercially producing 
shale formation outside of north america 
and it is currently producing at a rate of 
more than 90,000 boepd. our 2p reserves have been independently 
assessed at 57.2 million boe, and our 
contingent and prospective resources 
have been independently assessed at 
1,795 million boe. we have working interest acreage in the 
vaca muerta of approximately 560,000 
acres – equivalent to approximately 7.5% 
of the formation acreage as a whole. the unconventional

annual report and accounts 2017 the 2015 elections returned a progressive 
and pro-business government that is 
focused on economic growth and stability. this progressive administration provides 
the foundation for real change in the 
fortunes of argentina. following more than a decade of 
domestic policy that stifled investment, 
the current macri administration came 
into power in 2015. the new administration 
is progressing a business friendly growth 
agenda that has reconnected argentina 
to the international community. since being elected, the administration 
has delivered significant advances 
with regard to foreign policy, economic 
normalisation and social reform.
