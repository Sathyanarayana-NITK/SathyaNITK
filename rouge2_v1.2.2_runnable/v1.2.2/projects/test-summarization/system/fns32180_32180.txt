dividend
the board is pleased to declare a final dividend 
of 8.5 pence per share, making a total of 15.7 
pence per share for the year, an increase of just 
over 10 per cent compared with the previous 
year (2016: 14.2 pence). for the year to 31 march 2017 however, 
the board has fulfilled its promise to increase the 
dividend payment above that level in order to offset 
the dilution in earnings resulting from the equity 
placing in late 2015.  therefore, the interim dividend 
together with the full year dividend equates to 
over 40 per cent of earnings for this financial year. however, legislation introduced 
on 1 april 2016 increased by three per cent 
the sdlt payable by purchasers of buy-to-let 
or second homes. shareholders
we have grown pre-tax profit tenfold since 2012, 
paying at least one third of earnings as dividends 
each year. founded in 2000, we now directly employ 
248 people and have a development pipeline 
of over 4,000 homes. telford homes is skilled in all aspects of 
london development and we can apply our 
knowledge and expertise to a wider range  
of opportunities in new boroughs. we develop in non-prime locations to 
maintain an affordable price point for our 
individual customers and our strategic move 
into build to rent provides scope to work 
with investment partners across london. as 
telford homes continues to grow and our strategy 
evolves, there is a need to ensure that the culture 
that has made the business so successful to date is 
preserved, yet able to adapt to the requirements of a 
larger organisation. this sector complements our 
historic focus on individual sales to investors and 
owner-occupiers and is well aligned with our forward 
selling philosophy. for this reason, the group plans 
to review its corporate vision, mission and values 
during 2017 to ensure these reflect the evolving 
position of the business and allow us to capitalise  
on the opportunities that lie ahead. 06 in a year that has seen strong operational growth, our 
admirable health and safety record merits mention. health and safety is the first item on the agenda at 
monthly board meetings and our performance is 
testament to the sound policies and procedures 
in place, as well as the deep-rooted sense of 
responsibility that pervades the organisation. hackney

key management information economic outlook
london’s economic growth has outpaced that 
of the rest of the uk for the last ten years, with 
the exception of 2009 to 2010 (see chart 1), 
and it is projected that london will remain the 
fastest growing region, although its pace of 
expansion could reduce from around 2.5 per 
cent in 2015 to an average of just under 2 per 
cent in 2017-18. 
the economic environment is proving to be 
robust and the economy has performed better 
than expected post the eu referendum vote, 
with the housing market remaining resilient.
