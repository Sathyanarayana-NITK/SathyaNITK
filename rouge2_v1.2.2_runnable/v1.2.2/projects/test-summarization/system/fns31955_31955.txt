increased by 12% over the 12 months

universe continues to grow
the emerging markets investment 
universe continues to grow rapidly and 
now comprises us$44.6 trillion of fixed 
income and equity securities, an increase 
of 12% or us$4.7 trillion over the past 12 
months. looking at emerging markets fixed 
income securities, the us$20.1 trillion of 
outstanding bonds is dominated by local 
currency issuance comprising 89% of the 
total. when combined with the us$30.3 
trillion of domestic credit outstanding, 
emerging markets account for only 27% 
of global finance. – institutional clients represent 88% of group aum
 – growing contribution from retail clients accessed through 
third-party intermediaries 
 – one-third of aum sourced from clients domiciled in 
emerging markets
 – deep understanding of emerging markets underpins 
active, value-based investment philosophy
 – processes add risk when markets have been oversold 
relative to fundamentals
 – investment committees mean no individual manages 
funds and there is not a star culture
 – track record extends more than 25 years

the foundations of some of the world’s

approach
highly diversified  
client base
ashmore has a strong investment track record 
established over 25 years of focusing on the 
opportunities available in emerging markets. investment performance
the group’s value-based investment processes are 
delivering strong investment performance for clients, after 
identifying attractive investment opportunities in the highly 
diversified emerging markets investment universe and 
adding risk in earlier periods of market weakness. the market 
recovery is in its early stages, with plenty of 
value still to be captured by active managers. the positive outlook, described in more detail 
in the market review, provides the potential 
for continued outperformance by ashmore’s 
investment processes that have been 
consistently deployed over the past 25 years. furthermore, 
over time, some countries will remove the 
impediments to index inclusion, for example 
by improving foreign investor access to their 
domestic capital markets. while retail capital-raising was 
difficult against this backdrop, the group 
secured new distribution agreements and 
gained intermediaries’ approval for products 
to put it in a stronger position when the cycle 
turned and investor sentiment improved. ashmore group plc | annual report and accounts 2017 1
