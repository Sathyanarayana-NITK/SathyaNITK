nothing in this document 
should be construed as a profit forecast. we 
are focusing our portfolio on the most 
attractive end markets, where we can 
sustain above-market growth. the rate at which this decay or attrition 
happens can be surprisingly high, 
depending on the type of end market 
being served. if a company wants to 
grow faster than the market, it has to 
make this replacement at a rate which 
well exceeds the natural rate of core 
attrition. smiths group plc annual report 2017

our strategy
our ambition is to establish smiths as 
one of the world’s leading technology 
companies. by their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can 
cause results and developments to differ materially from those anticipated. the company and its directors accept no liability to third parties in respect of this 
document save as would arise under english law. our values
we are united by our shared values,  
which guide our actions and behaviour 
every day, no matter our role. it’s clear from the challenging experiences 
of many great companies in recent years, 
that unless we prepare properly for the 
future, the one we want probably won’t be 
there when we need it. we will achieve this by 
outperforming our chosen markets and 
delivering world-class competitiveness 
and innovation, underpinned by 
our strong financial framework. operational excellence clearly has 
a big part to play in a company’s 
competitiveness, although there is 
no amount of process excellence that 
can ever adequately substitute for 
a healthy dose of innovation. nor is 
there an adequate substitute offered 
in productivity initiatives alone. we welcome noel’s 
extensive experience and expertise in higher-growth economies such 
as asia and africa. smiths group plc  annual report 2017

higher growth market focus
we have decided to build a much stronger 
focus on growing in these higher growth 
regions. we saw growth 
across the portfolio offset by john 
crane’s oil & gas business and in smiths 
medical due to market challenges in john 
crane and a delay in some new product 
launches in smiths medical. results are already starting to 
come, with around £40m in procurement 
savings and an £85m reduction in 
working capital of which £52m is 
reduction in total stock over the past year, 
helping us to fund investment in growth. growth in 
john crane’s non-oil and gas markets, 
as well as an increase in aftermarket 
activities, is expected to more than offset 
the challenging market conditions in 
oil and gas. they appear in a number of places throughout this document and include 
statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations and those of our officers, directors and employees 
concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and 
the business we operate. our solutions
our products and services are often 
critical to our customers’ operations, 
while our proprietary technology 
and high service levels help create 
competitive advantage. our solutions 
make a real impact on the world – from 
enabling industry, improving healthcare 
and enhancing security, to advancing 
connectivity and supporting new homes. our people 
we employ around 22,000 people globally 
and are building a learning organisation that 
enables them to be the best that they can be. our end markets and businesses
today, we serve seven end markets 
through our divisions: john crane, 
smiths medical, smiths detection, 
smiths interconnect and flex-tek. we have not 
changed or deviated from this mission 
one bit since i became the chairman 
of smiths, though i’m proud to say that 
under the dynamic leadership of our 
chief executive andy reynolds smith 
and his team, we are now executing 
against this mission much faster. following 
chris o’shea stepping down from his role as chief financial officer in 
may, we were pleased that my board colleague and audit committee 
chairman bill seeger agreed to step into the chief financial officer 
role on an interim basis while we seek a permanent replacement. we were also delighted that non-executive director mark seligman 
agreed to take on the chair of the audit committee. definitions 
of headline metrics, and information about the adjustments to statutory measures are provided in the notes to the
