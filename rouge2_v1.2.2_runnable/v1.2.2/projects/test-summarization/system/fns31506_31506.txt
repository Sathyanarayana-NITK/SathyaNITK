“
i am delighted to report on a
successful year, delivering against our
strategic objectives of growth, retention,
acquisitions, debt reduction and
operational transformation. retention: 
during 2017, customer retention remained strong at a rate
of 95%, in line with management’s expectations. the board has overall responsibility for managing risk. the group has a delegation of
authorities that clearly sets out the approval required for key activities, including those restricted to the board and the executive
directors. the audit and risk committee, which includes the independent non-executive directors, monitors and promotes the highest
standards of integrity, financial reporting, risk management and internal control. the
executive directors are closely involved in the day-to-day management of the business and have oversight of all the controls the
business has in place, including financial, operational and compliance controls, as well as overseeing risk management. the architecture of the
technology enables us to do this on a continual basis with a
team that is well versed in the practice with documented
processes and procedures. using osmo’s technology, finance and
tax teams can significantly decrease the manual workload
associated with data collection, reduce errors and risk from
re-keying data and increase the speed and accuracy of data
production. the powerful part of collecting and storing data digitally is
what can then be done by the regulators using analytical
software. due
to the level of data regulators will hold, the number of audit
notices is likely to increase which will require swift responses
from businesses and a greater level of quality and accuracy. our current focus is on the corporation tax software and
services market in the uk and ireland. we made significant investments during 2017 to maintain,
update and de-risk our solutions and services in light of the
increasing regulatory landscape. osmo’s
leading edge technology is now embedded as part of our
core value proposition and helps organisations automate the
collection of data from large accounting / erp systems. ”
2017 has been a year of significant and exciting activity for the
company on the transformational journey to develop and
upgrade our products and services in order to support our
customer base of large corporates and accountancy firms in
meeting the increasing demands of tax compliance. 248502 tax systems pp01-pp05  17/05/2018  10:55  page 02 strategic report

services that currently connects to 310 versions of accounting
software packages, whether they be cloud, on premise or

obligations:
in 2017 alone, the uk’s finance (no.2) act 2017 was the
longest in recent memory, stretching to 665 pages compared
to 187 pages in finance act 2018.
new international reporting including the oecd’s common
reporting standard (“crs”) and base erosion and profit
shifting (“beps”) have come in to force in both the uk and
ireland. the
company is seeking to continue to build on and expand the
solutions and services it provides to its clients both organically
and through acquisition to help them navigate and comply
with the ever increasing regulatory environment. we are confident in our ability
to continue to increase both our
capabilities and shareholder value
moving forward
”
i am pleased to report to shareholders in respect of the year
ended 31 december 2017.
the year under review saw the company make encouraging
progress to its longer-term objective of being a leading
international provider of regulatory compliance software and
professional services. over time we expect more
demand for automation and process control which is where
we want to provide enhanced functionality and value. we look forward to extending our technology offering by way
of continued product development and targeted acquisitions. the acquisition of osmo contributed £1.0m to total
revenue, comprised of £0.8m from licences and £0.2m from
professional services. the group continually monitors market
developments and together with its
m&a advisor and broker, regularly
evaluates potential acquisitions and
partners. 248502 tax systems pp06-pp17  17/05/2018  10:57  page 17 corporate governance

during 2017, we achieved year-on-year revenue growth of
17% (10% comparable organic growth) and contracted

through 114 new annuity licenses added and average order
value growth of 9%. uk debt levels were at
£1,720 billion for the financial year ending march 2017 which
represented 86.7% of gross domestic product (“gdp”). uk
deficit levels were at £46.9 billion for the same period. a key focus
of the government, together with the regulators, is to
increase tax revenues, reduce tax evasion and ensure
businesses are paying their fair share of tax in order to
support government spending and reduce the annual deficit. whilst these
forward-looking statements are made in good faith, they are
based upon the information available to tax systems at the
date of this report and upon current expectations,
projections, market conditions and assumptions about future
events. in this business we met
all internal and external targets including increasing our
revenue, contracted annuity base and number of new
customers. of particular note has been the level of cash
generated from the business, which has allowed us the reduce
debt levels faster than initially planned.
