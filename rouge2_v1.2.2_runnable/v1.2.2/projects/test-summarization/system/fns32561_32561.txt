1,300 stores in 29 international markets

chairmanâ€™s statement
although the modern day 
whitbread is very different from 
the original brewing business 
founded by samuel whitbread in 
1742, we are immensely proud of 
our history and it is a great honour 
for me and my colleagues on the 
board to play our own part in the 
whitbread story. more detail on 
our strategy can be found on pages  
10 to 13 and information on progress 
against our strategic objectives can  
be found on pages 41 to 45.
we have remained on course to deliver 
our objectives, whilst at the same time, 
refreshing our board and the executive 
leadership team. â€ 
  definitions of all apms are 
included in the glossary on

in the virtuous circle on this page

dividend of 65.90 pence per share, 
making a total dividend of 95.80  
pence per share, up by 6.0%. total basic earnings 
per share increased by 7.3%. we delivered high customer 
satisfaction by leading the market on 
quality and value, achieved occupancy 
of over 80% with record levels of direct 
bookings at 94%, all of which supported 
our strong return on capital. 2016/17 performance
group underlying profit before tax rose 
6.2% to Â£565.2 million and underlying 
basic earnings per share increased 6.0% 
to 246.48 pence. in order to provide  
a clearer comparison throughout 
this report, year-on-year growth  
in numbers relating to revenue, 
underlying profit and underlying 
earnings per share are shown 
usingÂ a 52-week comparative, 
which excludes the final week 
ofÂ the 2015/16 financial year. performance measures  
the performance of the group  
is monitored internally using  
a variety of statutory measures 
such as total revenue and profit 
before tax and alternative 
performance measures (apms) 
such as underlying profit before  
tax, like for like sales and return  
on capital. apms are not defined 
within ifrs and are used to  
assess the underlying operational 
performance of the group. as such these measures should  
be considered alongside 
ifrsÂ measures.
