the information in this annual report is deemed to 
be useful and relevant to our stakeholders, with due 
regard to our stakeholders’ expectations through 
continuous engagement, or that the board believes 
may influence the perception or decision-making of our 
stakeholders. the information provided aims to provide 
our stakeholders with an understanding of the group’s 
financial, social, environmental and economic impacts 
to enable them to evaluate the ability of mediclinic to 
create and sustain value for our stakeholders. our growth forecasts for the abu dhabi operations 
were signifi cantly impacted in the short term due to 
unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment and 
a greater need to align al noor with the sustainable 
business and operational practices of the mediclinic 
group. this enables us to continue 
to focus on enhancing operational effi  ciencies. group results are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. refer to page 15 for exchange 
rates used to convert the operating platforms’ results to pound sterling. as a result, revenue and underlying ebitda 
margins during the year were lower than expected in 
the middle east. earnings per share were 
further impacted by the effect of additional shares 
issued for the spire and al noor transactions. **  the environmental data of mediclinic southern africa and mediclinic middle east is for the 2016 calendar year, while the 
comparative data is for the financial year ended 31 march 2016. the environmental data relating to hirslanden was also 
reported on a calendar year basis in previous reports. the company’s primary listing 
is on the lse in the united kingdom, with secondary 
listings on the jse in south africa and the nsx in

switzerland mediclinic annual report 2017 8 chairman’s statement
chairman’s statement
last year i reported on the consistent growth of 
mediclinic over the past 30 years, for which we are 
thankful. our expansion into abu dhabi, eff ectively doubling the 
size of the middle east business following the al noor 
combination, has not met our original expectations. however, for the past fi nancial period, the fi rst 
full year following the company’s listing on the london 
stock exchange, the group was unable to deliver its 
consistent growth in underlying earnings per share 
achieved in the past, largely due to challenges in our 
middle east platform. despite the challenges in abu dhabi, 
our established dubai operations continued to perform 
well. i remain confi dent in 
our approach to expansion in the region, and that it will 
deliver the required longer-term growth and returns 
for the group. in switzerland and southern africa, our largest two 
operating platforms, we have seen good trading 
performances this year. the holding companies for the 
al noor operations are al noor 
holdings cayman limited and 
anmc management limited. in april 2017, the co-payment 
in abu dhabi was waived with immediate effect. in al ain, the mediclinic al jowhara hospital had its 
fi rst full month of trading in january 2017 and is 
ramping up. i am pleased 
that the co-payment that was introduced in abu dhabi 
in july 2016 was waived with immediate eff ect on 
26 april 2017 following our ongoing dialogue with the 
relevant stakeholders in the region. annual report

scope, boundary and 
reporting cycle
this annual report and financial statements (“annual 
report”) of mediclinic international plc (the “company” 
or “mediclinic”) presents the financial results, and the 
economic, social and environmental performance 
of the mediclinic group for the financial year ended  
31 march 2017 (the “reporting period”), and covers the 
company’s operations in southern africa, switzerland 
and the united arab emirates (the “group”). this annual report was prepared in accordance with 
the international financial reporting standards, the 
lse listing rules, the jse listings requirements, 
the uk corporate governance code, and the uk  
companies act (including the recently promulgated 
companies, partnerships and group (accounts and 
non-financial reporting) regulations 2016) aimed at 
improving the transparency of companies regarding 
non-financial and diversity information, where relevant. the group’s registered office is in london, 
united kingdom. mediclinic also holds a 29.9% interest 
in spire healthcare group plc, a lse-listed private 
healthcare group based in the united kingdom. during february 2016, the combination of the company 
(previously named al noor hospitals group plc), with 
operations mainly in abu dhabi in the united arab 
emirates, and mediclinic international limited was 
completed. mediclinic international limited was a 
south african-based international private healthcare 
group founded in 1983 and listed on the jse, the south 
african stock exchange, since 1986, with operations 
in south africa, namibia, switzerland and the united 
arab emirates (mainly in dubai). mediclinic is focused on providing acute care, specialist-
orientated, multi-disciplinary healthcare services. our 
core purpose is to enhance the quality of life of our 
patients by providing comprehensive, high-quality 
healthcare services in such a way that the group will be 
regarded as the most respected and trusted provider 
of healthcare services by patients, doctors and funders 
of healthcare in each of its markets. as i have stated before, this 
indicates positive trends in patient choice and shows 
that we are attracting and retaining suffi  cient doctors 
to support the business. the 
federal government is also preparing a framework 
for the outmigration of services (shift of basic medical 
treatments from the inpatient to the outpatient sector) 
across switzerland.
