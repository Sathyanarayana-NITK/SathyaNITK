cir_ar17_intro_v17.indd   5 25/04/2018   17:15 rapidly growing revenues
during 2017 , we established a transformational commercial 
collaboration with astrazeneca in the united states. during 2017 tudorza
®
 contributed 
to our business for over half of the year, while our global niox
®
 
sales continued to grow strongly throughout the period. following the establishment  
of its collaboration with astrazeneca, circassia rapidly doubled the 
size of its us field force, recruiting, training and launching the enlarged 
team in under two months. this new sales team has performed well, 
and at the end of the year tudorza
®
 prescriptions were significantly 
ahead of the declining trend established prior to circassia’s full 
promotion and are set for future growth. the company will also benefit from a full year’s revenues from 
its tudorza
®
 collaboration. we also added 
late-stage copd product duaklir
®
, and with its us clinical 
development now complete we look forward to its filing  
in the near future. with its investment 
in the allergy field halted, circassia has focused resolutely 
on building its respiratory franchise, and consequently has 
transitioned into a very different business in a relatively short 
period. circassia has focused resolutely on building  
its respiratory franchise, and consequently  
has transitioned into a very different business  
in a relatively short period. significant operational progress
throughout 2017 , the company’s operational execution has 
underpinned this strategic progress. circassia is now highly commercially focused, with  
a broad sales infrastructure, which it plans to expand further 
through a refocused investment strategy, and a portfolio  
of marketed products. at the end of 2016, the company significantly 
expanded its us commercial platform, both to increase revenues  
from its in-house niox
®
 products and to attract in-licensing, partnering 
and acquisition opportunities. with the collaboration making good 
progress, circassia plans to build on this momentum by deploying  
a refocused investment strategy pursuing a similar approach in china. by leveraging its existing presence in the country to establish an initial 
sales force, circassia plans to boost its niox

 revenues and provide  
a commercialisation option for third-party products in this major market. tudorza
