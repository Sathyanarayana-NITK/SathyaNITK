chairman’s statement
financial results
group revenue for the year ended 31 march 2017 increased by  
7 per cent. to £22.5m (2016: £21.0m) whereas net fee income (“nfi”) 
improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to £6.19m (2016: £5.73m). whilst 
the market sectors in which nakama operates are in high demand, the 
business needs stable local economies in the current trading locations, 
stability in current staff numbers and the continued hiring of new sales 
staff to deliver against less specialised but much larger competitors. uk operations
uk operations continue to see existing markets come under pressure 
from in-house recruitment and externally managed service providers. headcount remained stable but 
the business did not meet its hiring targets internally. over the last year 
the market has become more heavily brokered and fragmented and the 
ability to generate value in traditional digital sectors has been eroded. the management team has stabilized over the past year and is now 
in a position to focus on delivering value to clients and shareholders 
going forward. we continue to look to recruit further excellent, driven 
individuals to meet our client and candidate needs. executives and staff
the group retains a strong team of very knowledgeable and long 
serving staff and we look forward to continuing to build the nakama 
group. the board would like to acknowledge the loyalty and 
commitment of all the staff to the group and we are extremely grateful 
for their efforts.
