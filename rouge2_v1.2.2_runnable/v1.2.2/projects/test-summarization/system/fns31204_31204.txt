we are a committed and loyal partner with a 
continuing record of delivering value through 
quality products with the highest levels of 
food safety, traceability and integrity, whilst 
providing a range of services which enable 
our customers to evolve and improve their 
meat and fish supply chain management. in doing so, they have 
rationalised their supply base, achieving 
lower costs with higher food safety, food 
integrity, traceability and quality standards. hilton operates a decentralised, entrepreneurial 
business structure, which enables it to work very closely and flexibly with its retail 
partners in each country, in order to achieve high service levels in terms of orders 
delivered, delivery times, compliance with product specifications and accuracy of 
documentation, all backed by an uncompromising focus on food safety, product 
integrity and traceability assurance. its potential impact the group’s products predominantly carry the brand labels of the customer to whom 
packed meat and fish is supplied and it is accordingly dependent on its customers’ 
success in maintaining or improving consumer perception of their own brand names 
and packed meat and fish offerings. it is expected that production 
will begin in the first quarter of 2019.
central costs and other
net operating cost before exceptional 
items £4.4m (2016: £3.9m)
this segment includes our share of the 
management fee earned by our joint 
venture with woolworths of £4.3m 
(2016: £3.1m), start-up and support costs 
of £1.5m (2016: £0.6m) and central costs 
of £7.2m (2016: £6.4m). the operating profit margin in 2017 
was unchanged at 2.8% (2016: 2.8%), 
and the operating profit per kilogram of 
packed food sold was unchanged at 12.5p 
(2016: 12.5p). interest cover in 2017 remained high 
increasing to 39 times (2016: 31 times). taxation
the taxation charge for the period was 
£7.2m (2016: £6.6m) representing 
an effective taxation rate of 21.0%. our continued investment in our facilities 
includes new technology to increase 
capacity, improve operational efficiency 
and offer innovative solutions to our 
retailer partners. hilton seeks to build long term customer 
and shareholder value by focusing on:
 – growing volumes and extending 
product ranges supplied and services 
provided to its existing customers;
 – optimising the use of its assets and 
investing in new technology and 
capacity expansion as required;
 – maintaining a vigilant focus on food 
safety and integrity and reducing unit 
costs, while improving product quality 
and service provision; and
 – entering new territories and markets 
either with new customers or in 
partnership with our existing customers. central europe is an exception where our 
facility in poland supplies multiple retailers 
in order to achieve critical mass in terms of 
volumes supplied and, as a consequence, 
gives us the ability to achieve competitive 
unit packing costs. we seek to keep ourselves at the forefront 
of the meat and fish packing industry, 
which helps ensure our continued 
competitiveness. group performance
we grew our volume in 2017 maintaining 
a trend of continuous growth achieved 
in every year since hilton’s flotation in 
2007. there was strong pre-exceptional 
operating profit growth of nearly 12% 
including the benefits of the seachill 
acquisition and favourable exchange 
rate movements (over 2% up after 
exceptionals) which was achieved despite 
considerable investment in people 
and infrastructure to support growth. pre-exceptional basic earnings per share 
were 11% above last year (down 1.5% 
after exceptionals). with the proposed final 
dividend of 14.0p per ordinary share, total 
dividends in respect of 2017 will be 19.0p 
per ordinary share, an increase of 11.1% 
compared to last year. during 2017, 
the average exchange rates for the various 
overseas currencies in which the group 
trades have all appreciated significantly 
against sterling, compared with the 
corresponding period in 2016, specifically, 
the euro by 7.2%, the danish krone by 
7.3%, the polish zloty by 10.0%, the 
swedish krona by 5.2% and the australian 
dollar by 8.5%. we remain committed to achieving good 
governance and compliance with the uk 
corporate governance code including 
succession planning and maintaining a 
talent pipeline. we fully recognise the 
benefits of gender diversity and details 
of the gender composition of our staff 
are set out in our corporate and social 
responsibility report. hilton has not to date been 
materially adversely affected by the 
lengthy recessionary environments seen 
in some countries, but will keep any future 
identified country specific risks under 
continuing review. historically the incidence of bad debts 
has been immaterial. 2017 was a transformational year 
and we achieved significant strategic 
progress. hilton made good progress with volume 
and profit growth demonstrating our 
geographical and operational progress. this momentum has continued into 
2018 and we continue to explore further 
expansion opportunities. given the growth 
in business categories and geographies, 
planning of future resource implications  
is well in hand. our first facility opened in huntingdon in 
1994 supplying tesco uk. in 2000 we took 
over an existing facility in zaandam, holland 
supplying albert heijn which also has stores 
in belgium. in 2004 new factories were 
built in drogheda, ireland supplying tesco 
ireland and in vasteras, sweden supplying 
ica gruppen. our facility in tychy, poland 
opened in 2006 and supplies ahold stores  
in czech republic and slovakia, tesco stores 
in hungary, czech republic, poland and 
slovakia and rimi stores in latvia, lithuania 
and estonia. hilton signs fresh

introducing
we are pleased that the 
partnership has progressed to 
a full joint venture agreement 
in portugal, which will enable 
us to strengthen the leadership 
position of continente further in 
the development of innovation 
and the sustainable promotion 
of the agro-food business 
in portugal.”
eunice silva
commercial director,  
sonae modelo continente
i’m delighted that we are 
extending our deep group-
wide partnership with hilton 
to bring new manufacturing 
investment and capability to 
poland. the seachill acquisition was funded 
through an equity placing which raised 
over £55m and a new bank refinancing 
putting in place a syndicated facility. hilton continued to generate significant 
operating cash flow during 2017. 
this enabled the group to end the year 
with net cash of £25.4m, compared with 
£32.3m at the end of last year, despite the 
significant investment made in the seachill 
acquisition, net of the equity raised to part 
fund it.
