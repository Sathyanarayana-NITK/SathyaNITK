there is a recognised shortage of high quality  
specialist education and behavioural health  
services for children in the uk. our focus during the year has been to fill 
existing capacity, increase fee levels from 
higher acuity services and reduce the cost 
base to increase margins. good progress has 
been made on increasing average fee levels 
and average occupancy levels have been 
maintained whilst re-positioning services. 4 adjusted basic earnings per share is defined as statutory basic earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, m&a costs, 
ipo share option charges and exceptional and extinguished items, net of the tax effect of these adjustments. cambian group plc  annual report and accounts 2017 6 revenue

our people
nothing of what we do to improve the lives 
of the children placed in our care would 
be achievable without the hard work 
and dedication of the front-line staff and 
managers throughout our organisation. we ended the year with a strong balance 
sheet. nothing in the document shall be regarded as a profit forecast and 
its directors accept no liability to third parties in respect of this report save as would arise under english law. we provide services to almost 
2,000 children and young people 
across 222 locations. we work 
with the majority of local 
authorities in england and  
wales and employ more than 
4,500 people. cambian has an extensive 
footprint, and we currently 
support people from over  
190 local authorities, clinical 
commissioning groups and 
health boards. such forward-looking statements which reflect the directors’ assumptions made on the basis of information 
available to them at this time, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors which could cause the actual results, 
performance or achievements of cambian group plc or the markets in which it operates to be materially different from future results, performance 
or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. cambian’s

a number of different

to tackle challenging

pharmaceutical  
companies; and the  
criminal justice system. cambian group plc  annual report and accounts 2017 4 cambian’s approach

long-term goals
navigate from service provider to centre of innovation and expertise
– a repository for data
– accredited therapeutic models with outcomes
– true cost/benefit demonstrated through impact studies
– experts in autism, trauma, mental health and special educational needs
– innovation through strategic and academic partnerships
the higher the severity of need, the more significant the shortage  
and the group estimates there are approximately 88,000 children  
who would fall into cambian’s core target market. independent providers can also offer benefits 
for commissioners through greater levels 
of specialisation. 2017 has been a year of transition as we 
established our platform to achieve modest 
growth and become the leading provider in 
children’s services. however, since then we have undertaken 
a significant cost-cutting exercise. this will result 
in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions 
on an annualised basis, half of which have 
been reflected in 2017.
we have also spent 2017 repositioning the 
business towards a differentiated integrated 
recovery model incorporating care, education 
and therapy for children with the highest needs, 
which is where we believe there is a significant 
shortage of care and education facilities. this transformation has led us to review all 
of our facilities and where appropriate we 
have closed certain facilities that cannot be 
re-positioned cost-effectively . our
