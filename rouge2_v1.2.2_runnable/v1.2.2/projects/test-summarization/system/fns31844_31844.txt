customers’ journey from point

where it now has a 2.5% (2016: 2.4%) share. looking ahead
globaldata forecasts state that scs core 
markets are now set to resume growth 
– with circa 10% growth anticipated 
between 2017 and 2022 in upholstered 
furniture and circa 6.8% in floorcoverings. scs has over 100 years of 
furniture retailing experience  
and our specialist staff are highly 
trained in their fields, so that we 
can offer our customers the best 
service and advice when they 
choose new sofas and flooring

trained staff with a focus  
on customer service
 scs places emphasis on the provision of high levels of service 
throughout the customer experience from the point of sale 
through to delivery and providing appropriate after sales 
service if required. the overall market contracted significantly 
as a result of the global financial crisis and 
the prolonged recession that followed. the value of the upholstered furniture 
market fell from almost £4.0bn in 2007  
to an estimated £3.2bn in 2017. 
the signs are that the furniture and 
floorcoverings markets in 2018 will  
return to growth after a very challenging 
few years. we believe there is still considerable room  
to grow our market share in both upholstery 
and floor coverings through continued 
pursuit of our strategy for growth. 09

i. strategic report
scs has a number of key strengths that have 
supported the growth in sales and profits  
in the last three years and which provide  
a strong foundation for further growth. in 2014 scs began operating the upholstered furniture and carpet 
concession ranges for house of fraser. the concession currently operates from 27 house of fraser stores 
across the uk and offers a collection of sofas, flooring, dining and 
occasional ranges. by the 1980s, the business operated  
from eight stores in the north east of 
england under the scs name, specialising 
in selling upholstered furniture. following  
a management buyout in 1993, the 
business began to expand outside of the 
north east of england, and focused on 
establishing scs as a major uk upholstered 
furniture retailer operating from large, 
modern stores. • failing to ensure we can attract and

why invest in scs
 # 1 
one of the largest retailers  
of sofas and flooring
a combination that gives scope to develop our current customer 
base, provide further ‘sell-on’ opportunities to our current 
customers and reach new customers through the development  
of our house of fraser concessions. this represents an increase of £7 per 
square foot or 3.2% on the £219 achieved  
in the 12 months ended 30 july 2016.  
this increase was achieved by continued 
focus on the following:
• the ongoing targeting and 
maximisation of a branded range  
of products and the continued 
development of our flooring offering;
• maximising our average order value, 
with furniture order values rising 1.1%  
in the year to £1,575, and flooring order 
values rising 3.5% in the year to £629;
• continued investment in our online 
capability, resulting in both the benefit 
of direct sales through the website and 
the indirect benefit of improving the 
quality of footfall, with customers  
often entering our stores having already 
researched their choices. this has 
ensured that, despite decreases in 
footfall noted industry-wide, customers 
are more engaged and more likely  
to place an order; and
• improving the customer journey, 
experience and confidence, evidenced 
by an improved trustpilot satisfaction 
score. our target is to open two to three new stores per year with over  
20 potential new store locations identified. a number  
of operational initiatives were also 
undertaken, including upgrades to 
business processes, management 
information and information technology 
systems. a further 
20 potential locations have been identified. management has identified over 20 potential new locations  
within the uk.
