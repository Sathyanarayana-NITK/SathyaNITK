review of the year
the financial year ended 2 september 
2017 was a challenging year as the 
group’s financial performance was 
impacted by external factors affecting 
both divisions which were highlighted  
in our trading update on 20 july 2017. 
despite this, the year was also one  
of investment and significant progress 
towards achieving the group’s medium 
term strategic objectives. we have also increased the strength  
and depth of our management team  
in the engineering division through the 
appointment of a divisional managing 
director who will oversee and coordinate 
the businesses in the uk, germany and 
the usa. despite challenges  
in both of our divisions, 
the year was one of 
investment and significant 
progress towards 
achieving the group’s 
medium term  
strategic objectives. we therefore 
remain confident in the future prospects 
of both divisions. the board remains firmly committed  
to good governance. however, 
the board will continue to monitor  
the position closely and the group will 
remain flexible to respond to any 
challenges that may arise. the uncertainty following the outcome 
from the eu referendum remains, 
particularly relating to the future of the 
single farm payment and support for  
uk farmers. its diverse range of products and services includes 
manipulators, robotics, patented technologies, radiation 
protection and decontamination, specialist fabrication  
and precision machining. in october 2016 we acquired 
a german family-owned engineering 
business, staber gmbh, which designs 
and develops specialised technology 
and is highly complementary to 
wälischmiller, our german remote 
handling business. since its acquisition, 
staber has been integrated with 
wälischmiller and we are investing in the 
extension of our premises in markdorf, 
germany to consolidate both operations 
into one site and provide additional 
efficiency, flexibility and capacity. core competencies
deep industry knowhow delivering market leading solutions

leading livestock farmers across the globe in the dairy, beef, 
sheep, pig and equine sectors. in our agriculture division, while the uk 
business benefited from a recovery in 
farmgate milk prices and consequently 
improved farmer confidence, sales 
volumes in our usa feed block business 
were affected throughout the year by 
lower cattle prices. the outlook for uk agriculture remains 
positive with farm incomes continuing 
to improve in the near term. its diverse geographic  
spread and depth of divisional coverage provides strength

business strategies
focused on growth markets
we aim to succeed by being selective in what we do. we constantly strive to build deep and long lasting relationships  
with customers across a range of carefully chosen markets. that network is expected to include south america in 2018 
following the conclusion of farm trials. *as at 2 september 2017. figures exclude head office. this was partially 
mitigated by a gradual recovery in the 
second half which has continued into 
the new financial year. the plant is expected to be completed 
before the end of december 2017  
and following this the group will have 
comprehensive coverage of all the major 
cattle areas in the usa.
