an international business-

asset management, price 
discovery, data & market 
intelligence, and banking

including euromoney, 
institutional investor, 
bca research, ned davis 
research and metal bulletin. we also run an extensive 
portfolio of events for the 
telecoms, ﬁnancial and 
commodities markets. recognising 
the need for a robust price, metal bulletin launched 
a shanghai copper price which has since become 
an important benchmark, so much so that the 
chicago mercantile exchange has launched a 
derivative contract which will be settled using 
metal bulletin’s price. by broadening 
its product suite, ii has pivoted away from 
its traditional publisher status to a business 
where over 80% of its revenues are derived 
from non-publishing activities. ii has 
invested in its proprietary managermatch 
platform, helping investors find fund 
managers more efficiently and it is designed 
to become an integral part of investors’ 
manager diligence and selection processes. its primary 
event, datacloud europe, is held annually 
in monaco and brings together leading 
carriers, data-centre providers, cloud-
storage providers and systems integrators 
to develop business and to network. layer123 organises leading network-
innovation events around software-

institutional investor: 
investing in new segments
by investing in and launching fintech 
capital placement platforms, institutional 
investor (ii), celebrating its fiftieth 
anniversary in 2017, is accelerating its 
transition towards becoming a b2b 3.0 
information business. our improved results reflect that our strategy is on 
track as we continue to invest in strategic themes, 
operate more effectively across the business, 
taking advantage of our scale but still remaining 
entrepreneurial and actively manage the portfolio. this has allowed us to accelerate 
our management of the portfolio and enabled the 
adoption of a new, progressive dividend policy 
with an increase in pay-out ratio. we continue to serve our four segments through 
this structure, ensuring that our businesses remain 
entrepreneurial while enabling them to benefit 
from economies of scale, best practice and 
stronger governance. this price will provide the 
market with a hedging option for copper sold 
to china, the world’s largest consumer of the 
commodity, and generate additional revenues 
for our price-reporting business. 3
active portfolio management
active portfolio management is one of the pillars 
of our strategy. 4
a new operating model
we have established a group management board 
made up of our divisional and functional leaders. 5
improved governance
we have made good progress in a range of areas 
such as recruiting new independent non-executive 
directors, reconstituting committee memberships, 
appointing a senior independent director and 
making sure our board is more diverse in its makeup. equally, the reorganisation of our management structure 
and the creation of the new group management board has 
had a telling effect on performance. partners
we collaborate with our partners in mutually 
beneficial ways to enable us both to understand 
and penetrate each other’s markets better. strong third-party relationships are important 
to help us execute our strategy and we seek to build 
longer-term relationships with those partners where 
appropriate. our success owes much to understanding 
and engaging with the communities we serve. that is changing, but 
we want to remain a place where innovators and self-starters 
thrive and those who want and deserve responsibility and 
relish accountability can still progress rapidly. by selling businesses which are 
not strategic for us and buying ones which fit our 
strategy, we continue to recycle capital towards 
our best opportunities. when ceo 
andrew rashbass defined our new strategy in march 2016, 
we said that 2017 would be a year of transition with a return 
to growth in 2018. our 2017 results actually show a year of 
“transition plus”, using the strong us dollar to invest in our 
business and still deliver improved results compared with last 
year. i look forward to watching 
the company go from strength-to-strength and becoming a 
3.0 information business. however, 
several central banks are indicating that rates 
are likely to rise. although this work is not 
complete the momentum is reassuring. the coming year
as the strategy becomes embedded in how the group operates, 
i have decided now is the right time for me to hand over the 
chairmanship of the company. our results demonstrate that the 
strategy which the company is implementing is working and 
i am confident that i hand over the chairmanship to david 
pritchard with the company in a strong position. our results demonstrate that the strategy under andrew’s 
leadership is working and i am confident that euromoney 
is in a strong position.
