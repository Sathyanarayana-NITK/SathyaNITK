our 
global research and development 
programme is demonstrating that 
poly4 delivers greater nutrient uptake 
and improves both yield and quality on 
multiple crops in varying geographic 
conditions across the world. polyhalite is a relatively common 
mineral which occurs in marine 
evaporite systems and is usually 
found in accumulations several 
centimetres thick. the low impact 
infrastructure ensures no mineral will 
come to surface until after it leaves 
the national park and arrives at the 
mhf. the scale and quality of the mineral 
resource combined with the relative 
proximity to a deep-water port 
present significant economic and 
operational advantages and give the 
project all the hallmarks of a world-
class resource asset. sustaining  
the future

chairman’s statement
it is with considerable pride that 
i share with you the notable 
achievements that have been 
key to the continued success of 
our polyhalite project in 2017. 
first and foremost, the commencement 
of construction, in a safe and secure 
environment, has seen us take major 
strides towards our goal of first 
production in 2021. the impressive 
construction progress over the last 
12 months sits alongside several other 
key achievements which are all 
contributing towards the successful 
fulfilment of our ultimate vision: to 
become a world-class fertilizer business. the impressive construction 
progress over the last 12 months 
sits alongside several other key 
achievements which are all 
contributing towards the successful 
fulfilment of our ultimate vision: 
to become a world-class 
fertilizer business. having been associated with 
significant mining projects for a large 
part of my career, i take great comfort 
that this expected success of our 
business goes well beyond the 
investment proposition. the efforts of 
our team and supporters are already 
creating positive, tangible economic 
change in the uk and we look forward 
to doing so for many years to come. • ftse 250 inclusion

at full production over 1,000 high-
skilled jobs will be created with an 
additional 1,500 jobs created in the 
supply chain. the high-skilled jobs 
we will create will also be highly 
productive and well-paid. in addition to the employment 
opportunities created, the company 
expects that, at full production, it will 
make around £85 million in local 
payments each year and will deliver 
approximately £13 million in annual 
contributions to the sirius minerals 
foundation, as well as being a 
catalyst for regeneration with the 
potential to create new economic 
clusters in the region. approvals in place
