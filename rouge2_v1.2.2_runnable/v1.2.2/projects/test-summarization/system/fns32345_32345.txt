good progress across contracts 
and markets
we have continued to deliver across new 
and existing contracts demonstrating 
the quality of our operations and the 
resilience of our business. furthermore, each sector is underpinned 
by deep technical knowledge and 
expertise and is already demonstrating 
a willingness to embrace babcock’s 
transformational change and 
performance improvement models. moving to a sector‑based reporting 
structure that is more closely aligned 
with our markets serves to provide 
clarity and focus. we 
are equipment‑agnostic which enables 
us to work with any oem to specify and 
support its products. my stem 
work allows me to continue teaching people about why science is so important to society and the great careers that women can build in 
the sector.”

deep sector expertise
in february 2017, we announced that 
we were going to realign the business 
around the four core sectors in which 
we operate. the realignment will 
enable us to effectively leverage our 
capabilities and share expertise across 
the group through four key enablers:
marine
delivers a wide array of complex through‑life 
marine engineering services ranging from 
supporting uk and international naval 
fleets, commercial marine, engineering 
consultancy, weapons handling, equipment 
support, intelligence and cyber‑security and 
technical training, all delivered through unique 
owned and managed infrastructure to defence 
and civil customers across the globe. infrastructure
we have experience of operating and 
managing complex and critical infrastructure 
assets in highly regulated environments, from 
unique owned marine facilities, critical 
air and land fleets, nuclear licensed sites, 
naval, air and army bases, technical training 
sites to customer‑owned aircraft. aviation
delivers a wide array of critical engineering 
services to defence and civil customers, 
ranging from technical training of advanced 
fixed and rotary wing pilots, engineering, 
equipment support and maintenance, airbase 
management and logistics, to the operation 
of owned and customer‑owned aviation 
fleets delivering emergency and offshore 
services across the globe. as chair of plymouth women in stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), i’m very involved with sending our stem 
ambassadors to events and schools. each sector has a strong base of both 
defence and civil customers, with 
operations of scale in the uk and 
internationally and importantly all 
four have growth opportunities across 
the globe. through infrastructure, assets, 
technology or regulation, all four 
sectors are characterised by high 
barriers to entry. in the uk and, 
increasingly, internationally. we are a trusted partner who understands the critical role that our customers’ 
assets and infrastructure play in delivering their business; we share risk with them 
in delivering innovation and efficiency, and we share the benefits. the underlying figures provide 
a consistent measure of business 
performance year to year, thereby 
enabling comparison and understanding 
of group financial performance. grouping our business into 
marine, land, aviation and cavendish 
nuclear brings us even closer to our 
customers and markets, allows our 
teams in each sector to really focus on 
the capabilities we offer and makes 
the group easier to understand for all 
our stakeholders. most importantly, 
it provides us with a better platform 
for future growth, both in the uk and 
globally. basic earnings per share*

*underlying
the adjustments described below, 
collectively, are made to derive the 
underlying operating results of the 
group. with babcock, i’m being given the chance to do exactly that. my phd in marine 
toxicology certainly had a nuclear element to it, which comes in handy when i’m fixing a technical problem or making sure that people 
stay safe. a typical day involves writing reports – just as it did when i was a research scientist – but it also includes talking to colleagues 
inside babcock and to clients about safety or technical queries that might have been raised. i’m also likely to get my overalls on to go and 
examine a submarine. throughout the strategic report, unless 
otherwise stated, revenue, operating 
profit, operating margin, net finance 
costs, profit before tax and earnings per 
share refer to results before amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and exceptional 
items. revenue, operating profit, 
operating margins and net finance costs 
also include the group’s share of equity 
accounted joint ventures and associates. operating profit and operating margin 
include investment income arising under 
ifric12 which is presented as financial 
income in the income statement. all 
numbers are stated before the effect 
of corporate tax rate changes.
