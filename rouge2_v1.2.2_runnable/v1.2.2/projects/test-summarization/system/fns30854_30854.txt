headquartered in the uk, meggitt specialises in 
components and sub-systems providing critical 
functionality in challenging applications within civil 
aerospace, military and energy markets. stephen has been succeeded by tony wood 
who joined meggitt in december 2016 as 
chief operating officer. highly durable sensors placed close to critical 
pieces of equipment relay information on everything from vibration anomalies to electrical currents back 
to a central computer system. the wound is encased in a rubber gel, which suppresses 
the ignition source, stops fuel leakage and enables flight crews to return safely to their home base. our divisions

in research and development, the focus

growth and operational efficiency of the 
business. we invest in technologies and 
capabilities that enable our customers to develop 
aircraft, gas turbines and other complex equipment 
that has to perform in challenging conditions. it was launched 
in 2013 to create a sustainable quality and 
delivery culture that drives competitive 
advantage beyond our technical expertise and 
enables the group to deliver a higher rate of 
organic growth over the long term. before our crashworthy fuel tanks, over 
42% of survivable helicopter crashes in the us resulted in deaths from fuel fires. today, meggitt’s 
crashworthy, self-seal fuel tanks, which meet rigorous standards for flexibility, strength, impact and cut-
and-tear resistance have stopped fuel spillage and reduced fire-related death and injury in such crashes 
to almost zero. if punctured by a high impact explosive 23mm bullet, meggitt’s ballistically-resistant fuel 
bladders will self-seal in less than two minutes. during the year, meggitt has further enhanced its growing platform 
positions with a number of contract wins on new and existing 
programmes including the airbus a320neo and a321neo, boeing 777x, 
comac c919 and embraer e2 aircraft. capital allocation

our third priority is to target value accretive 
acquisitions in attractive markets where we 
have or can develop a strong competitive 
position. having passed the peak of 
investment in r&d, our focus 
is on delivering on these new 
programmes to our 
customers and accelerating 
growth in returns to 
shareholders. over the last few years, investment in our 
portfolio has enabled us to significantly 
increase the number and value of meggitt 
parts on new platforms that will drive growth 
for decades.
