the 
year has been one of substantial progress and 
significant change, with a number of exciting 
developments taking place across the business, 
some of which are mentioned in the chief 
executive’s review. performance & strategy
the group delivered a strong financial 
performance during the year. this was achieved 
despite a backdrop of continuing economic 
turbulence. the business, along with many 
others, faced a number of challenges including 
significant cost inflation, the devaluation of 
sterling against major currencies and the 
well documented uncertainty around brexit 
negotiations following the general election. ultimate products' performance is attributable 
to a number of factors:  a superb range of 
great value core products, new and innovative 
products, an excellent supply chain, a strong 
and extensive customer base of leading 
retailers and, not least, the committed and 
talented colleagues that we employ who 
deliver our company values every day. this powerful 
combination is important to customer focused 
businesses that require certainty in value, 
quality and critically, supply. over recent years, the group’s strategy has 
been to develop a portfolio of brands focused 
on the growing market of value-led consumer 
goods for the home. our strategy has four key pillars: 
1. growing our business with 
 discount retailers; 
2. increasing our penetration in 
 uk supermarkets; 
3. expansion via online channels; and 
4. international growth. accordingly, we are 
creating development programmes for rising 
stars and have already put in place various 
incentive schemes that reward outperformance. ● we invest in quality: both our uk and china offices have in-house teams of qa professionals. we are a member of sedex and audit our key suppliers to the eti code of conduct. ● we invest in our people: our graduate development scheme was established in 2012 and we 
 now employ 78 people who are either on the scheme or have completed it. intempo dynamic headphones

'glossary' section. finally, the refurbishment of ultimate products' 
new 240,000 sq ft warehouse at heron mill 
in oldham has been completed to plan and 
is now the group's main distribution facility. ● we are branded: beldray, salter (under licence until 2024), intempo, russell hobbs

group revenue rose 39.1 % to £110.0 m (fy 16: 
£79.0 m), and continued to be driven by three 
main factors:
1. growth in sales to discounters in the uk 
 and in europe (up 64.6 % to £63.8 m);  
2. increased sales to the main uk 
 supermarkets (up 95.0 % to £10.3 m); and 
3. the emergence of online platforms as a new  
 revenue for the business (up 63.6 % to £4.6 m). underlying profit before tax* was up 42.0 % 
to £10.7 m. gross margin was down by 1.6 % at 
22.3 % as a result of a higher mix of free on 
board (‘fob’) business in the year and, for our 
landed business, as a result of imported price 
inflation arising from a weakened sterling. clear sound. clear sound. financial highlights 4

i am very pleased to introduce the first annual 
report for the group as a listed business. initial public offering
on 6 march 2017, the group was admitted 
to the premium segment of the official 
list of the financial conduct authority 
and to trading on the main market of the 
london stock exchange plc. james mccarthy

6 november 2017
i am very pleased to introduce the first annual report 
for the group as a listed business. underlying measures are calculated after adding back 
exceptional items and share based payment charges as referred 
to in note 7 to the financial statements. dividend
the board is committed to a progressive 
dividend policy, with an intention to distribute 
50 % of the group’s adjusted profit after tax. the final dividend is payable on 30 january 2018 
to shareholders on the register on 5 january 2018.
summary
the board fully believes that our strategy of 
developing and building a portfolio of brands 
that are focused on mass-market and value-led 
consumer goods for the home will create further 
value for all our stakeholders, and we are excited 
by the group’s long-term growth prospects. this reflects:
1. the economies of scale from higher revenues; 
2. an increased proportion of fob sales 
 (which is less overhead intensive), partially  
 
 offset by increased sales via online platforms 
 (which is more overhead intensive); and 
3. a more efficient operating model as the 
 focus on the group’s brand portfolio, which  
 has led to an increase in repeat sales 
 and extended product life cycles. cordless cleaning. we

recognise that the future prospects of the 
business are reliant on both retaining our very 
best talent and recruiting new colleagues to 
the business that have the same potential and 
attitude as our very best. due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty 
and tougher trading conditions, retailers are 
generally exercising caution with regard to their 
non-food buying as we head towards the end 
of the calendar year. www.upgs.com
