strategic report at a glance
focused on food
food is our core competence. and given the structural growth potential in food 
services globally, we remain positive about the 
company’s future. our role
as the industry leader, we have an important role  
in society for the long term. based on published revenues, employees and meals served. the executive board of the group manages and assesses the performance 
of the business on these measures and believes they are more representative of ongoing trading, facilitate meaningful year on year comparisons and hence provide more 
useful information to shareholders. north 
america performed strongly, and revenues in both europe and  
rest of world accelerated in the second half of the year as expected. we continue to drive operating efficiencies around the business 
which, combined with the end of the restructuring in our offshore  
& remote business, resulted in margin improvement of 20 basis 
points in the period. suppliers
each year we spend around £6 billion on food. we also benefitted from the end of the restructuring plan 
in the emerging markets and offshore & remote last year and the 
absence of these costs this year. 2017 was another year of progress

understanding our clients
the global food services market is very large and disparate. shareholder returns
as a result of our strong performance, the board is recommending  
a 5.7% increase in the final dividend for the year of 22.3 pence per 
share (2016: 21.1 pence per share). this gives a total dividend for 
the year of 33.5 pence per share (2016: 31.7 pence per share), 
an increase of 5.7%. this was very much in evidence when, as a board, we visited our 
award-winning us subsidiary bon appétit, in silicon valley. appointment of new chief executive
in september, we announced a significant change in the group’s 
board. richard cousins, who has been an outstanding chief 
executive for the past 11 years, will step down from his role on  
31 march 2018 and retire from the group on 30 september 2018.  
it has been a huge pleasure to work with richard, and on behalf of 
the board i want to thank him for his extraordinary contribution to 
the group. i am delighted that richard will be succeeded by dominic 
blakemore, our former chief operating officer, europe. in more 
developed markets where outsourcing rates are routinely in excess 
of 60%, our combination of scale, efficiencies and first class service 
delivery supports continued revenue growth. it underpins our competitiveness and enables us to deliver sustainable growth over time. we improved margins by driving further efficiencies through the 
business, aided by the end of the restructuring plan in offshore & 
remote. we remain 
committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and 
will continue to return surplus cash to shareholders and to target net 
debt/ebitda of around 1.5x. all underlying measures are defined in the glossary of terms on page 196. a summary of the adjustments from statutory to underlying results is shown on page 161 and 
further detailed in the consolidated income statement (page 107), reconciliation of free cash flow (page 112), note 1, segmental reporting (pages 120 to 123) and note 5,  
tax (pages 127 and 128). compass provides outsourced food and support services in around  
50 countries in a market worth over £400 billion (comprising 
approximately £200 billion food service and £200 billion support 
services). the five sectors in which compass operates are: business 
& industry; healthcare & seniors; education; sports & leisure and 
defence, offshore & remote. sports & leisure — 12% of group underlying revenue
operating at some of the world’s most prestigious sporting and leisure venues, 
exhibition centres, visitor attractions and major events, we have an enviable reputation 
for providing outstanding hospitality and true service excellence. we create opportunities 
for our people to achieve their greatest potential  
and enrich their lives. creating strong client relationships 
allows us to respond positively to tougher market conditions. it enables us to be closer to our clients and consumers to 
better understand their different needs. we educate young people on how 
to have a happy, safe and healthy lifestyle while contributing to a sustainable world. that is why we 
segment the market into various sectors and sub-sectors using our portfolio 
of b2b brands. this is a complex segment 
and there are significant differences in client buying behaviour 
across countries, sectors and sub-sectors. the outsourcing culture is vibrant and the addressable 
market is significant. compass’ competitive advantages
sectorised approach
the global food services market is very large and disparate and we 
find that segmenting the market into various sectors and sub-sectors 
using our portfolio of b2b brands allows us to operate more 
effectively. the rigorous execution of our 
strategy continues to deliver shareholder value. we promote healthy and 
nutritious food offers for our clients and consumers. together with our supply chain partners, we set 
global standards to ensure we consistently source 
our food responsibly and sustainably. we are developing operational excellence in areas such 
as our proposition for hospital visitors and nutritional meal planning 
in schools and, by sharing this expertise, we can better serve our 
clients and consumers across multiple markets.
