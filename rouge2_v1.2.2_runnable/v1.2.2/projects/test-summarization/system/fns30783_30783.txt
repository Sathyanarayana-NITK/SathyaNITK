why we exist
exchange rates are moving all 
the time. 2
  underlying eps excludes the impact of the one-oﬀ costs relating to the ipo and their tax eﬀect and share-based payments. training accounts are deﬁned 
as client accounts that have been onboarded by new employees which have generated less than £10,000 in total revenue. if businesses’ 
exposures to them are not 
managed e ﬀectively, they can 
present a signi ﬁcant risk – 
impacting pro ﬁt margins, cash 
 ow and the ability to price 
competitively. for those purchasing signi ﬁcant 
volumes of currency, a modest 
movement of just 1- 2 per cent 
in exchange rates can have a 
big impact on ﬁnancial 
performance. 4
  the directors exclude training accounts to provide a clearer picture of client retention for the purposes of these ﬁgures. alpha exists because managing 
these exposures e ﬀectively is 
time consuming, resource 
intensive and expensive - often 
involving dedicated in-house 
treasury teams or outsourced 
currency management 
consultancies. this makes e ﬀective currency 
management unviable or 
expensive for many. there are 
hundreds of foreign exchange 
brokers in the uk, and most will 
provide products and market 
information to manage currency 
risk. 3

manage their currency exposure as 
e ﬀectively and e ﬃciently as possible. further operational progress
was made with the expansion of our fx analysis
team and through obtaining regulatory approval
to sell derivative products. it provides our clients with
a tailored and comprehensive overview of their
currency exposures and is subsequently allowing
them to manage and report on these exposures
more eﬀectively, whilst reducing the time and
costs involved in doing so. henry joined alpha in 2013 as a portfolio
