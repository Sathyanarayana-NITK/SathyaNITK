advancing aviation, keeping the skies safe. we	are	making	the	skies	an	even	safer	and	more	efficient 
environment	for	flying. our objectives
 > deliver	a	safe,	efficient	and	reliable	service	every	day. the board has reviewed the group’s dividend policy. in	may 	
2017,	the	group	paid	a	first	interim	dividend	of	£28.5m	for	the	2018 	
financial	year. the trustees intend to bring forward their next valuation to 31 december 
2017. this will help inform nerl’s initial performance plan for the 
next regulatory reference period (rp3: 2020-2024) on which we will be 
consulting customers and other stakeholders from spring 2018.
uk’s eu referendum decision
while	the	outcome	of	the	uk’s	eu	referendum	decision	and	the 
triggering of article 50 has not had an adverse impact on the demand 
for	air	travel	to	date,	it	has	potentially	significant	implications	for	the	uk	
aviation sector. since	then,	hmg	has	indicated	that	while 
it has no plans imminently to dispose of its shareholding, it will 
continue to keep its investment under review. deliver sesar and transform the 
business for the future
 > we consulted customers on our revised investment plan for rp2, 
which accelerates the deployment of sesar technology. in	our	
view	the	logical	outcome	is	for	the	uk	to	re-establish	national	economic	
regulation	of	uk	atm	and	to	retain	control	of	this	critical	part	of	the	uk’s	
national infrastructure. this would avoid the complexity and cost of 
having two regulators (the european commission and the caa) 
and enable nats to be more agile in responding to changing  
customer requirements. this would also be the most reliable means 
of	ensuring	that	nerl	continues	to	be	able	to	finance	its	operating	and	
investing activities. nats (en route) plc (nerl) is our core business and the sole 
provider	of	atc	services	for	aircraft	flying	‘en	route’	in	uk	airspace	and	
the eastern part of the north atlantic. it is regulated by the civil aviation 
authority (caa) within the framework of the european commission’s 
(ec) single european sky (ses) and operates under licence from the 
secretary of state for transport. nats (services) limited (nats services) provides atc services 
to	14	uk	airports	and	engineering	services	to	these	and	other	airport	
operators. it	provides	defence	services	to	the	uk	mod	through	aquila,

financial performance and dividends
the group’s revenue was £21m higher than last year, at £919m 
(2016:	£898m). we	enabled	
additional annual savings for airline customers of 55,900 tonnes of 
co 2 emissions. while 	airspace	customers	benefited	from	real	price	
reductions under the rp2 performance plan, the related reductions in 
revenue were more than offset by additional revenue from the increase 
in	flights	handled. this	growth 	
was much higher than assumed in our rp2 performance plan set when 
jet	fuel	prices	were	much	higher	than	today	and	flights	were	projected 
to	grow	by	only	2%. we	also	generated	additional	income	from	
supporting	the	uk	military	with	project	marshall,	which	helped	to	offset	
lower airports income. the	growth	in	flights	last	summer	(2016)	put	pressure	on	the 	
service with some sectors reaching existing design capacity, resulting in an 
increase in atc delay. i was pleased 
with	our	performance	as	we	handled	the	most	rapid	growth	in	air	traffic	volumes	in	a	decade	while	in	parallel	continuing	to	make	changes	to	our	operation. when 
the airspace is at capacity our service performance is very sensitive 
to	the	timing	and	distribution	of	traffic	flows	across	the	country. this	
was evident last summer when periods of bad weather combined with 
industrial	action	in	neighbouring	countries	(causing	flights	to	divert	into	
uk	airspace)	changed	the	patterns	of	flight	across	the	uk.
