since joining the company in 2009, 
our team has been keenly focused 
on creating strong foundations and 
a competitive cost base to ensure 
that we are in a solid position to 
weather industry-wide challenges. with this  
in mind we plan to invest in new plant, equipment  
and systems to further improve efficiency, 
product quality and our capability in sustainable  
and environmentally-responsible manufacturing. development of the foodservice channel is also 
an ongoing target for growth alongside any 
business acquisitions that meet our criteria. driving efficiency and scale has been a long-term  
focus for finsbury and has represented the 
rationale behind a range of initiatives we have  
implemented over recent years. these are difficult 
customer conversations and whilst diminished 
promotional spend reduced sales growth in the  
short-term, operating margin was successfully 
maintained in fy17 in conjunction with our 
internal efficiency improvement initiatives  
and recent capital investment. adjusted operating profit

we continue to make good progress  
in line with our stated aim of becoming  
a leading speciality bakery group  
in the uk. the board has reviewed 
the group’s strategy in the light of these external  
changes and has concluded that there is no need  
for any radical change of direction and we still 
firmly believe we are set on the right path to 
achieve our goal. we will continue to work hard 
to run our existing businesses as efficiently and  
effectively as possible whilst investing for the  
future and keeping a solid balance sheet that can  
be utilised, as and when the right opportunities 
present themselves. annual report & accounts 2017 1 finsbury food group

these figures are for the 52 weeks ended 1 july 2017 and 53 weeks ended 2 july 2016 unless stated otherwise. the 52 week period is calculated by eliminating the result for the 53rd 
week in the financial year ended 2 july 2016. 
adjusted diluted eps has been calculated using earnings excluding the 53rd week in the prior year, amortisation of intangibles, significant non-recurring and other 
items as shown in the tables above. •   sales to continental europe up 15% to £38.1m. unless stated otherwise stated the figures quoted for the prior year are for a 53 week period. adjusted operating profit and profit before tax exclude significant non-recurring and other items as shown in the tables above and includes amortisation of intangibles. therefore i am  
pleased to report on the solid performance and  
trading resilience the group has demonstrated 
against the headwinds posed by sustained sterling  
devaluation and high input costs experienced 
during fy 2017 . the latter performed  
particularly strongly as it benefited from 
improved celebration cake and free from product 
ranges and was boosted by the exchange rate 
tailwind from a weaker sterling. sterling’s structural  
decline amplified typically cyclical commodity 
input cost increases for uk manufacturers 
importing many of their ingredients. •  campbells cake company ltd is based in 
twechar near glasgow and produces cold set 
products such as caramel shortbread and 
tiffin for retailers. •  small snacking cake formats such as cake 
slices and bites. •  artisan, healthy lifestyle and organic breads 
through to rolls, muffins (sweet and savoury) 
and morning pastries, all of which are available 
fresh and frozen dependent on customer 
channel requirements. lightbody  
stretz procures, supplies and distributes a range  
of products to its customers. achieving 
growth
the company has delivered resilient uk sales 
in a deflationary market, with the impact of 
uk retail food market deflation in the period 
offset by the impact of innovation in cake 
and growth in speciality bakery ranges. the adjusted operating profit has been given as in the opinion of the board this will allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance  
of the group. like for like growth is calculated using financial data for the prior year for a 52 week period. the adjusted diluted eps has been given as in the opinion of the board this will allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding 
of the trading performance of the group. •   new artisan bread facility opened, baking for retail and foodservice 
customers. •   entered into consultation to close grain d’or, the loss making site in north 
london which manufactures premium baked goods in the uk pastry sector. the group is now one of the largest speciality 
bakery groups in the uk with a small but fast  
growing european business. this has seen the installation of a new automated 
whole cake line in an upgraded bakery at our  
cardiff site.
