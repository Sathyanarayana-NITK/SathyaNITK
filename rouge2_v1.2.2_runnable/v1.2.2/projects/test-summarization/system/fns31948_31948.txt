5 adjusted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting profit attributable to equity shareholders to exclude discontinued operations, exceptional items, other financial 
gains or losses, the unwinding of the discount on disposal provisions and the related tax effects, as per note 9. 3 group ebitda is group operating profit before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation. 4 adjusted profit before taxation is calculated by adjusting profit from continuing operations before taxation to exclude exceptional items, the unwinding of  
the discount on disposal provisions and other financial gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and borrowings. 8 alternative performance measure. the directors believe that exceptional items and adjustments impair visibility of the underlying performance of the group’s businesses and, accordingly, these are excluded 
from our non-gaap measures of revenue, profit before tax, ebitda, operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, which we use in internal reports. this year we made 
significant steps to increase the scale and impact of 
our response regarding the prevention and detection 
of problem gambling through:
◊ a newly formed board responsible gambling 
committee (see page 68 for more details);
◊ the development of propensity models to detect 
patterns of play symptomatic of problem gambling;
◊ investment in resourcing a team solely focused on 
responsible gambling; and
◊ the development of our new customer solutions 
hub in sheffield to better support our customers. more detail of our responsible gambling strategy can 
be found in the operating responsibly section of 
this report. we understand the important role the right culture 
plays in the gaming industry and in addressing our 
responsibilities to our customers and wider society. rank remains in a strong financial position, possesses 
market-leading brands and has a clear strategy for 
long-term growth. in the markets where we operate, rank is 
one of the few gaming companies able to 
offer customers a genuine multi-channel 
gaming proposition. we bring excitement and 
entertainment to the customers
