our est1897.co.uk site for watches is a great example of how we 
can successfully use the internet for retailing backed up by our 
store network. these activities have repositioned the business within the wider 
alternative credit market and allowed the group to access  
a broader customer base. we are focussed 
on maximising the potential from the core services while 
investing in the development of new products and channels. we believe that our network of stores supports this 
development, whether through click-and-collect from the 
est1897 website or by providing a face-to-face underwriting 
decision for customers we cannot serve with an online loan. this position is reviewed by the board on a regular basis. a member of our audit team celebrated 45 years’ service, with the

as at 31 december 2017, h&t was the largest 
pawnbroking business in the uk by size of pledge book. *this is the actual percentage of lending in each year which was redeemed or renewed; the 2017 figure is an estimate based on recent 
trend and early performance. the growth in retail, fx and buyback also provide a degree  
of resilience to changes in the marketplace. at year end the group had available headroom of £8.0m on its 
£30m borrowing facilities. i am pleased to report that in march 
2018 the facility was increased by £5.0m. contents

key performance indicators
the selection of the kpis has been revised to take account of the change 
in relative importance of product type to the group’s overall financial 
performance and position. financial performance 
the group delivered profit after tax of £11.3m (2016: £7.6m) and 
diluted earnings per share of 30.94 pence (2016: 20.88 pence). subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 6.2 pence 
per ordinary share (2016: 5.3 pence) will be paid on 1 june 2018  
to those shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 4 may 2018. this will bring the full year dividend to 10.5 
pence per ordinary share (2016: 9.2 pence). the group’s financial position is strong with growth in the 
combined personal loan and pawnbroking loan books (net) to 
£63.8m (31 december 2016: £50.2m). during the  
year the fca conducted a consultation on creditworthiness  
and is expected to publish the results in 2018.
we engaged with the fca through our trade associations and 
have analysed the proposals contained within the consultation. the consultation provides helpful guidance on effective 
creditworthiness assessments and clarifies some of the specific 
exemptions in relation to pawnbroking. before issuing a loan 
we establish the customer’s identity and complete  
a thorough affordability assessment. further work will be 
completed in 2018 to fully integrate those systems and support 
the clicks-to-bricks customer journey. prompt when

significant growth 
from a wider customer base “h& t provides a range of simple and 
accessible financial products tailored for a 
customer base which has limited access to, 
or is excluded from, the traditional banking 
and finance sector.”

cautionary statement
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document, including, without 
limitation those regarding the financial condition, results, operations and business of h& t group plc 
and its strategy, plans and objectives and the markets in which it operates, are forward looking 
statements. such forward looking statements which reflect the directors’ assumptions made on the 
basis of information available to them at this time, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties 
and other important factors which could cause the actual results, performance or achievements  
of h& t group plc or the markets in which it operates to be materially different from future  
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. nothing in this document shall be regarded as a profit forecast and its directors accept no liability  
to third parties in respect of this report save as would arise under english law. we have improved store profitability and have also  
made progress in the development of our online channel 
although there is still considerable work to do. the most common reason is that they may have 
experienced problems in the past which resulted in missed payment or 
defaults on their credit file. almost half of our personal loan customers  
are aged under 35 and generally have a thin credit file or a low credit score. it is possible to complete  
a pawnbroking or personal loan in store within 30 minutes. i was surprised  
i was accepted as my credit rating isn’t great but i still have credit.
