nex group plc is incorporated as a public limited company 
and is registered in england and wales with the registered 
number 10013770. nex group plc’s registered office is  
2 broadgate, london ec2m 7ur. nex markets saw an increase in their record volume trading day, with $234 billion 
traded in spot fx on one day in 2016/17 against a high of $229 billion in 2015/16,  
and $437 billion traded in us actives in 2016/17 against $317 billion in 2015/16. these are the foundations from which we will invest in 
the long-term growth and success of our business. this was partly offset by historically low fx volatility 
impacting trading activity on the ebs fx platform. performance
the decrease in operating margin reflects 
ongoing investment for growth, impact 
of hedging losses and certain one-off costs. performance
year-on-year increase is driven mainly by new
acquisitions which are subscription-based.
