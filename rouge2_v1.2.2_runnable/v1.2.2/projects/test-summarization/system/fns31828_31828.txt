our customers
the majority of our business comes from the small to medium-sized 
business segment, but public sector customers now account for 
more than 30% of revenue and continue to grow. the company has made significant investments 
in new sales, services and technical resource over the 
past two years and the return on those investments is 
evident in our performance. much of our focus will be on supporting the 
leadership team through the next chapter of growth for the 
benefit of our customers, employees and shareholders. despite our success we see more 
opportunities for organic growth. rather, they are based on current views and 
assumptions and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results or 
developments expressed or implied from the forward-looking statements. what is important is that there will always be a need to help organisations and 
businesses procure and manage it . notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding brexit, 
the business is in a confident mood and its relentless 
focus on customer service and employee engagement 
provides good grounds for optimism going forward. 6,500+

softcat plc annual report and accounts 2017 we’re on it... 
our aim is simple – to be the leading it infrastructure provider in terms 
of employee engagement, customer satisfaction and shareholder return. these forward-looking statements 
are not guarantees of future performance. each forward-looking 
statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement and, save to the extent 
required by the applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake any obligation to update 
or renew any forward-looking statement. i am 
confident that these plans will ensure a very orderly 
transition in due course. we do not develop bespoke applications or specialise in any industry-specific 
vertical application but can partner with third party organisations for these 
requirements. softcat was particularly 
proactive in advising and assisting customers on these 
types of threats. we want to be the go-to security 
company in the market and the partner of choice for cloud 
and datacentre. we can extend that opportunity by considering further 
geographical expansion both locally and internationally 
and by considering acquisitions. see pages 20 and 21 for more information on our kpis

• the employee engagement score is 
derived from responses to an annual 
survey of all staff. they have helped us achieve 98% employee 
engagement, 99% customer satisfaction and 48 consecutive quarters 
of organic revenue and profit growth. 2. see pages 22 to 23 for more detail on underlying adjusted operating profit performance. growth in gross profit, our primary 
measure of income, was 12.9% to £136.3m and adjusted 
operating profit increased by 10.1% to reach £51.5m. revenue growth was especially strong at 23.8% with 
software, hardware and services all delivering double-digit 
growth.
