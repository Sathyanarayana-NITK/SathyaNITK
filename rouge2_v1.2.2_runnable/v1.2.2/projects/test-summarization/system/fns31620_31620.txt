the acquisition of supply chain & erp solutions specialist, anisa, provides incremental opportunities
anisa and sanderson have known each other 
for many years and though this transaction 
is a sanderson acquisition, it feels more like 
a merger. the ipads are 
proving increasingly 
popular amongst sales 
assistants and customers

creating seamless shopping
the internet and mobile technology have 
changed the way people shop. keeping 
the customer happy used to be relatively 
straightforward but today’s new tech-savvy 
shopper has high expectations. digital retail is the application of new and 
emerging technologies, in particular mobile 
and social, to connect and transform the 
shopping experience and give customers 
what they want, when and where they want it. online shopping is easy and convenient. streamlines 
processes and drives growth. mitigating and 
offsetting these costs, was the receipt in full, 
of a licence fee from a former customer who 
had been disputing payment relating to their 
access of the group’s software. in order to augment organic growth, selective 
complementary acquisitions are under 
continuous consideration. sanderson 
management endeavours to adopt a careful 
and measured approach to acquisition 
opportunities and cautiously considers any 
risks which might be involved. pre-contracted recurring revenues increased to £11.18 million (2016: £10.75 million), representing 52% of total revenue in the period   
 (2016: 50%). operating profit* increased to £3.90 million (2016: £3.69 million). proposed increased final dividend up 11% to 1.55 pence per share (2016: 1.4 pence), making total dividend for the year 2.65 pence   
(2016: 2.4 pence). basic earnings per share increased 18% to 5.2 pence per share (2016: 4.4 pence). post year-end acquisition of anisa consolidated holdings limited, valued at £12 million (a world-class integrated supply chain and
