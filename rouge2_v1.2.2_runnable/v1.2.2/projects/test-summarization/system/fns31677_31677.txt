t
he group has 
delivered a solid 
performance 
in the financial year 
ended 30 september 
2017 against a 
background of changed 
market conditions. we were encouraged 
to see occupancy 
recover in h2 2017 
which, together with the 
addition of waves hotel 
to the portfolio, led to a 
revenue increase of 5% 
over 2016.
the team remains firmly focused 
on delivering our strategy, and we 
are pleased with the operational 
progress that has been made during 
the year. 161 suites

waves
waves is an all-inclusive 
contemporary property 
which was acquired and 
substantially refurbished 
in 2016. this reflected an 
improvement in occupancy in h2 
2017, partially due to the timing 
of easter (which fell in h2 in 
2017, as opposed to h1 in 2016). in addition to our regular capex 
spend of 4% of each hotel’s revenue, 
we spent approximately $1.5m 
on special projects, as planned. it reopened 
in december 2017 following $2.8m of 
refurbishments as a european-plan 
adults only resort. strategy is to leverage position as a 
leading hotel operator in barbados 
and to expand both on the island and 
further into the caribbean

business model
how we create value our strategy utilises our 
inputs and resources 
to capture the market 
opportunity in three ways:
• firstly, we leverage our 
existing properties, our 
fantastic teams and the 
wonderful caribbean 
climate to attract our 
guests and ensure 
they leave wanting 
to visit us again;
• secondly, we look to 
enhance our existing 
portfolio by refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing 
to maximise guest 
experience, profitability 
and occupancy;
• and thirdly, we actively 
seek out expansion 
opportunities within 
barbados and in the 
wider caribbean, 
through acquisitions and 
management or sales and 
marketing agreements. strategic priorities
