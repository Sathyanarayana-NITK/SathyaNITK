* adjusted figures exclude the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets, impairment of goodwill, release of accrued contingent 
consideration, exceptional items being restructuring, provision 
for export compliance and transaction costs, and interest on 
deferred consideration and gain on bargain purchase. in 2017 the stingray 
acquisition helped sales into the a&d sector approach one third 
of total revenues. stingray has delivered a consistently strong 
performance since acquisition. fy 2017 has been a ‘watershed’ year for the company, as we 
passed through the £100 million sales barrier for the first time. production technologies
laser material processing 
laser material processing is a broad term which encompasses 
production processes such as ablating, bending, cutting, 
curing, forming, fusing, marking, micro-machining, sintering, 
thermal annealing, via drilling, and welding. for these applications, we design and manufacture products 
which are used in laser cavities, to steer and control or to 
modulate the beam. printing 
in lithography and micro-lithography, the production process is 
inherently photonic in nature. we provide a variety of optical components into these 
applications where accurate transmitted wavefronts and high 
energy tolerance provide superior printed image quality and 
longevity in production. revenue

industrial
photonics play an ever-increasing role in industrial manufacturing. revenue of £112.0 million represents year on year growth of 
30.2%, or on a constant currency basis 18.7%. sub systems and systems now represent 22.1% of our business 
(2016: 15.1%), with the growth again helped by the recent 
acquisitions, most notably kent periscopes and stingray. g&h works with major prime contractors and government 
agencies on ground-breaking scientific and technology 
development programs for navigation, earth observation  
and communication. scientific research
g&h works with some of most prestigious big science projects 
in the world. investments made in recent years in “lean manufacturing” and 
“continuous improvement” meant that g&h was in part able to 
respond to this demand through an enhanced ability to match 
capacity with demand across the company’s various 
manufacturing locations. these 
new capabilities support the company’s twin strategic objectives 
of moving up the value chain and achieving greater diversification 
by enabling g&h to provide systems-level solutions to 
aerospace & defence (“a&d”) customers. significant 
progress has been made towards meeting our strategic aims of diversifying the business 
and moving up the value chain. we continue to invest in our continuous improvement and lean 
manufacturing programs, as well as production equipment and 
metrology to better serve our most demanding aerospace & 
defence customers. we maintain a leading role in research and development programs 
in europe, the usa and asia, through multiple projects and 
contracts centered on optical inter- and intra-satellite 
communication links. our work on space projects fuels the 
company roadmap on a new generation of product lines. optical coherence tomography (oct)
widely used for ophthalmic imaging, oct has proven invaluable in 
improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and macular degeneracy. medical and cosmetic laser systems
g&h is helping develop new laser products which enable less 
invasive surgical techniques. applications include cataract 
replacement, vision correction, prostate surgery, varicose vein 
treatment, and mole treatment in addition to tattoo removal, 
teeth whitening, freckle removal, and wrinkle reduction. the principal applications are in optical coherence tomography 
(“oct”), laser surgery and microscopy. sensing
fibre optics are deployed in a wide variety of sensing applications. they 
may also integrate fibre gratings as the sensor to leverage the 
superior resolution. we supply fibre optic and acousto-optic sub-assemblies and 
components to equipment manufacturers and installers of  
these systems. our customers deploy our fibre-based 
products in undersea networks and in space for  
satellite-to-satellite communications.
