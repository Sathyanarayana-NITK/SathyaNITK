where we operate
we operate across three countries: uk, germany and the netherlands 
offering a broad range of electricals. i ordered my new 
washing machine at 1pm on 
saturday and it arrived at 
1pm the next day. graham
first class 
delivery 
model
our in-sourced seven-day 
delivery (six in germany and 
the netherlands) is first class. having our own national delivery 
fleet operating out of a central 
distribution centre with a network 
of outbases, gives us control over 
our distribution chain. we also provide ancillary services such as the installation of new 
and collection of old products and offer product protection plans 
and customer finance. via our state‑of‑the‑art facility we are also 
able to carry out the recycling of waste appliances. most of our skus are 
available for next-day delivery 
– not many of our competitors 
can offer that. plenty of 
fridge freezers to choose 
from in stock. geoff cooper
chairman
over the past few months  
john (left) and steve (right) have 
transitioned seamlessly into their  
new roles, each playing to their key 
strengths. in february we announced a transition in our executive director roles, 
with steve caunce taking over as ceo and john roberts assuming the 
role of founder. this was a natural evolution and the board is confident 
that steve is the right person to take on the role from john to deliver the 
significant growth potential of the group. john’s new role will enable 
him to continue to play to his strengths as an innovator and a visionary 
leader, helping develop and test high level strategy. ao world plc  annual report and accounts 2017

about our delivery service
 i cannot believe the 
great service that…
i cannot believe the great 
service that i received from 
ao.com. we will do this by  
caring more  
from the first click  
to the recycling of  
old products  
(and everything  
in between). driven caring
smart
fun
bold
genuine people 
make the difference
you can’t pay people 
to care. we have the 
courage to try
we think in an 
unconstrained way 
to go beyond 
conventional limits. we are relentless
we deliver what others can’t. well done!!! we do this ‘the ao way’ – uniquely combining our customer 
proposition with our culture, systems and processes whilst 
maintaining end-to-end control. would recommend to 
others to use ao. we can also install 
new appliances and remove 
and recycle the old ones too. delivery guys were 
efficient and courteous in 
removing my old washing 
machine and installing my 
new one. we were 
kept informed of delivery 
slots and the driver phoned 
half an hour before he was 
due to deliver so we could 
plan our sunday. our price match 
promise is valid on the day the 
customer orders a product and 
up until seven days after. in the last quarter of the financial year the board reviewed the capital 
structure of the group and raised, shortly after year end, c.£50m via a 
placing of new shares. we have delivered another good year of top-line growth albeit with 
a challenging second half of the year which meant we missed our 
internal expectations. see pages 36 and 37 for further information on how we create  
and capture value

everything in-between
large 
available 
range
we offer an extensive range of 
mda items and we are growing 
our range of sdas, tvs and 
computing. this capital injection strengthens the balance 
sheet, provides flexibility to react to market opportunities and changes 
and, importantly, suitably capitalises the business to support our 
continued growth and increasing scale. steve and john 
remain very much a partnership and together they will ensure that ao 
continues to deliver for customers, colleagues, suppliers and our investors. further details 
are set out in the governance section on page 52.
in summary, the group has continued to make good progress against its 
strategy. group revenue increased by 17% to £701.2m. year-on-year uk revenue was up 12.7% to £629.7m (with ao branded 
sales accounting for £557.9m, up 14.5% year on year). revenue for our 
european segment was £71.5m/€84.7m; up 52.3% year on year on 
a constant currency basis. uk adjusted ebitda was £24.4m, up 41.7% 
from the prior year and europe adjusted ebitda losses were £26.5m, 
an increase of 25.5% against the prior year.
