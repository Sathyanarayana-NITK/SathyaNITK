the market
the past 12 months have seen changes  
in many respects. organic growth was supplemented by 
£1.2m of revenues generated by the mc 
trustees pension administration business 
acquired in september 2016, plus full-year 
revenues of £7.1m (2016: £5.2m) from the 
five businesses acquired in the prior year . why did mattioli woods decide it 
was time to launch its own fund? how long did it take to set up? in what way does it differ from 
others on the market? how would you describe its 
success to date? our distribution channels include our 
consultancy team, a nationwide network  
of professional introducers and, 
increasingly, our workplace financial 
educational programmes. i would like to thank all our staff for their 
continued commitment, enthusiasm and 
professionalism in dealing with our new 
and existing clients’ affairs. we welcome opportunities to talk to all 
shareholders, large and small, and we 
will continue to maintain a regular and 
constructive dialogue with them, while 
seeking to broaden our shareholder base. “we are thrilled to have 
amati global investors 
as part of the group 
and look forward to 
developing new and 
innovative investment 
opportunities and 
helping the existing 
trusts, fund and portfolio 
service in reaching 
a wider audience” 
simon gibson,
chief investment officer,

“bringing mattioli 
woods on board as a 
major shareholder in 
amati has been a hugely 
significant step, and 
has already borne fruit 
in our development. > read more page 06

1 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and acquisition-related costs. in september 2016 we were pleased 
to announce the acquisition of mc 
trustees, which is an excellent fit with 
our existing pension business and has 
contributed positively to the group’s 
trading result for the year . the general election 
result created fresh speculation around  
the shape of ‘brexit’ and regulatory 
changes continue at considerable pace. our immediate focus is on ensuring that 
we are fully compliant with those changes 
already in train, such as the markets 
in financial instruments directive ii 
(“mifid ii”), the general data protection 
regulations (“gdpr”) and the senior 
managers regime (“smr”). construction of our new central leicester 
office, which will provide our staff with a 
modern working environment and capacity 
for further growth, remains scheduled to 
complete around the end of this calendar 
year, with the move from our existing 
offices scheduled for the second quarter  
of 2018. costs are in line with expectations. in the last financial year we moved 
into larger premises in london and opened 
a new office in manchester, strengthening 
mattioli woods’ position in the north west 
following the acquisition of preston-based 
financial advisory firm taylor patterson in 
the prior financial year . following my appointment as the 
group’s first independent non-executive 
chairman, we carried out internal and 
external reviews of the effectiveness of the 
board, its sub-committees and the group’s 
senior executive management framework. we have created a new senior executive 
team (“set
go
”) to execute the strategy 
determined by the board, bringing together 
a senior team with responsibility for all 
our key operational areas. 2 before acquisition-related costs, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, and 
notional finance income and charges. the mattioli 
woods structured products fund was 
launched in november 2016 and its value 
now exceeds £100m. amati’s 
total aum has increased from £120m 
at acquisition to over £178m today. joanne lake

 (“aum”) increasing 
by £460m during the year, with £190m of 
new monies invested in our discretionary 
portfolio management service. custodian reit, the 
uk real estate investment trust managed 
by our subsidiary custodian capital, raised 
£76m of new monies during the year 
and now has a market capitalisation of 
almost £400m. review of the year
i am delighted to report another year of 
growth, driven by a strong flow of organic 
new business and continued demand for 
advice from clients, which together with 
acquisitions completed in this and the prior 
financial year has seen the group achieve a 
significant milestone in generating annual 
revenues of over £50m. one of our stated aims is to lower the 
cost of the range of services we provide 
to clients, while growing a long-term 
sustainable business. we continue 
to see demand for advice from clients, 
driven by lifestyle, increasing longevity, 
tax and other legislative changes, 
including the pension freedoms that 
introduced a major shift in how people 
can access their pensions, which in turn 
has driven further growth in pension 
consultancy and administration revenues. acquisitions continue to be a core part 
of our growth strategy. ketan was a fantastic employee and 
ambassador for all things mattioli 
woods. ketan is so sadly missed. net organic revenue 
growth of 12.3% (2016: 11.3%) excluding banking income and acquisitions in the current and 
prior financial years. organic revenue growth of 11.6% 
(2016: 8.5%) or £4.4m was driven by 
our largely home-grown consultancy 
team, further accelerated by growth in 
our investment and asset management 
and property businesses. strong revenue growth in the year 
translated into growth in adjusted eps 
of 11.4% to 34.1p (2016: 30.6p). this makes a proposed total 
dividend for the year of 14.1p (2016: 12.5p), 
a year-on-year increase of 12.8%.
