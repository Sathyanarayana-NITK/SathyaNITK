what we’re doing in the mobile market is similarly
about convergence – we aim to offer customers a
converged combination of ‘the best of ﬁxed and the best
of mobile’. an early example of this will
be project bluephone which will give customers the
convenience of a mobile phone with the quality and cost
advantage of ﬁxed-line services. our core portfolio covers traditional telephony
products such as calls, analogue/digital lines and private
circuits. we have a long and successful tradition of delivering
network-based connectivity to the carrier and
intermediate telecommunications markets throughout the
uk, and have developed value-enhancing services and
solutions. like so many other companies and individuals, we
wanted to respond to the devastating asian tsunami in
december 2004. we made a donation of £500,000 to
the disasters emergency committee (dec) and we
provided a live call centre for the unprecedented number
of calls coming into the dec. i’m particularly proud of the
fact that so many of our employees were involved in
fundraising activities and that 16 of our engineers
travelled to the affected area to help re-establish
communications. global networked it services
we have raised our global proﬁle through targeted
acquisitions, including infonet and radianz, and by
increasing our holding in albacom to 100%. our ict (information and communications technology)
revenues were £3 billion in the year and the major
contracts we’ve won indicate the conﬁdence that our
customers are prepared to put in us. we
now have over 372,000 contract connections. business progress
in support of our strategy for transformation and growth,
your board gave backing during the year for a targeted
series of acquisitions that will help to build our capabilities
as one of the world’s foremost global networked it
services companies. for our
business customers this means productivity
improvements; for consumers it’s about new, easier to
use services. so, for example, we offer our major corporate
customers around the world a unique marriage of our
networking experience and infrastructure with it services. and because this new network
will support a wide range of innovative services which are
currently run on separate networks, it will be much more
cost efﬁcient for bt. its principal activities include networked it services,
local, national and international telecommunications services,
and higher-value broadband and internet products and
services. in the uk, bt serves over 20 million business and
residential customers, as well as providing network services to
other operators. convergent mobility services
the launch, in partnership with vodafone, of our mobile
virtual network operator in both the business and
consumer markets is the key to building a mobility
customer base and a path to mobile convergence. our principal activities include networked it services;
local, national and international telecommunications
services; and higher-value broadband and internet
products and services. while continuing to invest for the future,
we generated free cash ﬂow of £2.3 billion, up 10%. the news on dividends is positive. we are
recommending a full-year dividend of 10.4 pence per
share, a pay out ratio of 57% of earnings before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, compared to 50%
last year. the dividend for the 2006 ﬁnancial year will be at
least 60% of underlying earnings: subject to the group’s
overall ﬁnancial position, we expect our pay out ratio to
rise to around two-thirds of underlying earnings by the
2008 ﬁnancial year. we continue with our progressive dividend
policy. during the year we have worked to help inﬂuence
and shape their thinking and made a radical proposal for a
new regulatory landscape in the uk. we look forward to the published
outcome. i would like to welcome hanif lalani as
our new group finance director. these acquisitions offered value for
money, had a compelling strategic ﬁt and brought
capabilities to strengthen bt globally. we continued to argue
strongly that structural separation was not in shareholders’
or customers’ interests. our position remains that a strategic and ﬂexible
regulatory regime, together with rapid deregulation
wherever possible, is vital to meeting customers’ developing
needs and creating the conditions in which we, and others,
can continue to invest with conﬁdence. wider responsibilities
it is increasingly important that companies such as bt
continue to be good corporate citizens, living up to our
responsibilities to the communities in which we operate
and to the environment. annual report and form 20-f 2005
