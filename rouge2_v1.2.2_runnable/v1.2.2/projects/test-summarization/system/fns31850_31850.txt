leading the way in  
the uk potato industry
the group has operations throughout the uk in seed production, growing and 
packing and serves a number of market sectors including retail, foodservice, 
wholesale and trading. customers include a number  
of the uk leading grocery retailers and 
wholesale and foodservice companies. ingredients supplied are used by a large 
number of food manufacturers in products 
such as diced potato salads and mashed 
potato for fish cakes and ready meals. while

recruitment to date, and return rates of 
seasonal staff remain high, clear direction 
from the government is required to ensure 
a brexit agreement that maintains access 
to this essential resource. we have also continued our investment in 
it, following the successful transition in 2015 
from in-house servers to a cloud-based 
external provider, thereby reducing the risk 
of business disruption and improving our 
contingency planning and disaster recovery 
capability. finances

chairman’s statement
a strong finish  
from a difficult start
the group ended on a high in a year of two halves. results
as we anticipated in the interim report, the 
second half saw a much improved trading 
result as we began to recover higher raw 
material costs in our core greenvale potato 
business, enjoyed a strong season for jersey 
royals and started to realise the benefits of 
our new erp system. having served two full 
three-year terms, senior independent  
ned sir david naish will also be retiring by 
rotation. barrie clapham will resume the 
position of chairman on an interim basis  
as the group commences a recruitment 
process to find a more permanent 
successor. liz kynoch will continue in her 
role as ned, as will robert johnston, the 
principal representative of the jerry zucker 
revocable trust, the largest shareholder  
in the group, who joined the board as ned 
on 9 june 2017. the board will continue  
to work in a sustainable way to deliver 
incremental shareholder value over the 
longer term. the principal financial kpi monitored by 
the board is the group operating profit. dividend
the board recommends an increased final 
dividend of 5.026 pence per share (2016: 
4.88 pence). together with the interim 
dividend of 2.44 pence per share (2016:
