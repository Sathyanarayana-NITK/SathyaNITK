when a manoeuvre is required, 
thrusters accelerate the satellite 
to the required position. this will translate 
over the medium-term into high relative 
returns on investment and ensure we 
continue to efficiently deliver a lower cost 
per bit to our customers, while maintaining 
tight control over the timing and extent 
of our capex. in government, 
we remain well-placed to capture value over 
the medium-term as the trusted provider 
of unique space-based capabilities to 
governments as and when near-term budgetary 
and operational tempo headwinds start to ease. we expect 
these factors to drive a meaningful moderation 
in our annual infrastructure capex over 
the medium-term. operate & lease satellite capacity end of life & future planning

we remain well placed 
to access future 
growth opportunities
we have seen solid progress in 2017 towards 
our objectives of building a significant new mobile 
broadband business with our new global xpress 
constellation, as well as investing in establishing 
a leadership position in the largest growth 
opportunity in the commercial satellite sector, 
in-flight connectivity for the commercial 
aviation sector. our response to 
sector headwinds
however, we have been hit with headwinds as well, 
which have negatively affected our share price. some of these derive from issues in the sector 
we are in. secondly, companies in the sector 
who are financially stressed have dropped prices. please refer to note 2 in the financial statements

particularly in maritime, aviation and government, 
we have seen solid steady performance in the

and powerful mobile satellite 
networks are always available. our mission-critical voice, 
video and data communications 
solutions help governments

an unrivalled portfolio
through our best in class networks we help our customers to communicate where 
terrestrial telecom networks lack reliability or coverage; on land, at sea or in the air. with these factors in mind, particularly 
their potential impact on our short to medium-term 
cash flow profile, the board took the decision 
to reduce the level of annual (full year) dividend 
payments to shareholders to 20.00 cents ($) 
per share. inmarsat plc | annual report and accounts 2017 15
