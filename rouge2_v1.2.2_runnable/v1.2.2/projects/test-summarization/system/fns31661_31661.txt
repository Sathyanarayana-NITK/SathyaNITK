that involves two basic 
imperatives: shortening the period to first house completion 
and accelerating quality delivery thereafter. it has taken 25 years of thought and hard graft. processes continue to be refined by a team that has 
unique experience and the right skill set to lead on 
strategic sites. we think bigger, 
bolder and longer. nigel hugill — chief exe cutive

i am very pleased to be able to report continued 
advancement across the course of the financial 
year and beyond. we are delighted to have him as we are sad 
to see bob dyson stand down at the forthcoming agm 
in february. he leaves with our grateful thanks. conditions are not getting any easier and uncertainties 
abound. our results 
demonstrate the extent to which the master developer 
model can be seen to be working financially as well as 
philosophically. annual report and accounts 2017
annual report and accounts 2017 the political mathematics are such that there 
is no realistic prospect of housing the fast growing 
population within 100 miles of london without an increased 
contribution from large sites. we are determined that strategic 
sites can make an increased contribution in our 
chosen markets within 100 miles of london and 
the largest provincial cities. employment levels in 
our selected areas of high population growth are at 
record highs. epra net assets reached £439.3 million, as compared with 
£409.8 million at 30 september 2016. unlike last year , the growth 
was divided pretty equally across the two periods. our master 
developer model is demonstrably addressing both. the master developer approach, with its 
emphasis on pace, scale, quality and sustainability, is 
woven into the dna of our business. read more overleaf the dna of a master developer

strategy
as a master developer which focuses on the delivery of strategic sites, we seek to 
provide a tangible financial dividend for our investors and a social dividend for our 
stakeholders across our entire portfolio. • at rugby, work has commenced on the western 
end of the link road with the full road scheduled 
to open in early 2019. this seven-year 
acceleration ahead of programme means 
discussions with our housebuilder customers on 
a new point of sale at rugby, some 1.5 miles from 
the existing hub, have already commenced. the stamp duty increase to five per cent announced 
in the march 2016 budget has gone a large way to 
negating any yield advantage on the sale of investment 
properties. • large site discount starting to 
reverse as forecast. • increased final dividend of 
2p per share, recognising 
progress and positive outlook. residential property sales contributed £5.7 million to 
profits and will rise from here.
