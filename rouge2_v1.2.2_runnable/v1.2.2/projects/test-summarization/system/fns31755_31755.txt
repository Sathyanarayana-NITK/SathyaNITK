our purpose is to provide safe, nutritious, 
affordable food and clothing that is great 
value for money. its unique breadth 
and experience enable it to add value 
all along the food, drink and biofuel 
industry supply chains. we look 
forward to the opportunity of developing 
further this fine business, using  
our existing capability in selling and 
marketing speciality foods internationally. it is their innovation, entrepreneurial  
skill, drive and ambition that enable  
us to grow and develop, and through 
their collaboration, build a network that  
makes the whole so much greater  
than the sum of its parts. it offers customers quality,  
up-to-the-minute fashion at  
value-for-money prices. buying and merchandising teams 
in dublin (republic of ireland) and 
reading (uk) travel internationally 
to source and buy fashion items 
that best reflect each season’s 
key fashion trends. the primark management team  
also had further success in mitigating 
currency headwinds, they delivered  
on-trend fashion and their stores have 
never looked better. a copy of the 
update is available for download at  
www.abf.co.uk/responsibility. given the economic and 
currency uncertainties a year ago, 
these results demonstrate the benefit 
of our international diversity and the 
strong underlying performance of  
our businesses. as anticipated, we delivered a strong 
recovery in sugar profits this year. this was a consequence of the recent 
structural changes made to ab sugar, 
the considerable benefit derived from 
performance improvement over a 
number of years and an increase in eu 
sugar prices. we believe 
that we are well placed to take advantage 
of the removal of sugar quotas in the  
eu arising from the reform of the sugar 
regime, and to meet the challenges 
including the recent fall in eu  
sugar prices. azucarera in spain 
produces over 400,000 tonnes of beet 
sugar each year and has a cane refining 
capacity of a further 400,000 tonnes. typical annual 
sugar production is 1.7 million tonnes. china
we operate two beet sugar factories  
in the north east of the country, with 
annual sugar production capacity 
of over 180,000 tonnes. we operate 24 plants  
in ten countries with the capacity to 
produce some 4.5 million tonnes of 
sugar and around 600 million litres of 
ethanol annually and are a significant 
employer. sugar

europe
our uk beet sugar factories typically 
produce well over one million tonnes  
of sugar annually. this year we delivered a 
particularly impressive cash flow which 
emphasises the group’s ability to convert 
profitability into cash. moving to full ownership  
of illovo last year has proved to be a 
positive step with an increase in profit 
which benefited from an acceleration  
of its commercial development and 
performance improvement. primark has the potential for significant 
growth and this was demonstrated  
again this year by its opening of a  
net 30 stores and 1.5 million sq ft of  
selling space across nine countries. financial headlines
