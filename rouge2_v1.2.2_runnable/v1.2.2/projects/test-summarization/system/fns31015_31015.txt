overview
our finance portfolio provides news, analysis and 
insight to enable fund managers, product providers and 
financial intermediaries to maximise their commercial 
performance through print, digital products and a range 
of events. centaur is successfully 
managing its own adaption to this changing 
landscape by reducing its exposure to print 
advertising and growing its higher quality 
digital recurring revenues. strategic progress
2017 was a year when the group was able 
to take advantage of the hard work that 
began in 2014. the measurable improvement 
of the quality of the revenue mix reflects 
management’s careful reduction of exposure 
to print and advertising revenues alongside 
development of new insight-led revenue 
streams. the disposal of the b2c home interest 
segment was a key milestone, creating 
a pure b2b focused group and enabling 
the acquisition of marketmakers, a lead 
generation powerhouse. i am confident in the 
outlook of the group and focused upon 
ensuring that centaur delivers long-term
