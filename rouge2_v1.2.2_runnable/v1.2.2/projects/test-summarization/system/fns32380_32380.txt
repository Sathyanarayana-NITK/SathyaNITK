the year-on-year fall  
in  net operating income was primarily driven by more 
challenging market conditions with sustained periods of 
significantly lower market volatility, providing fewer trading 
opportunities for our clients. the more significant fall in underlying profit before tax of 
22% was a function of the lower level of net operating income 
combined with our continued investment in the strategic 
growth initiatives, which will drive the medium to long-term 
growth of the group. although the financial performance is disappointing, the 
underlying fundamentals within the business have continued to 
improve with a 5% increase in active clients and client money at 
record levels. however, with this 
operational leverage we anticipate that when revenues increase 
there will be a low incremental increase in cost, and therefore 
believe that our strong client metrics are a good foundation for 
future earnings growth. . . . . 5

“our ﬁrst full year as a listed company has been one of progress as we have worked hard to position 
the group for future growth. clearly regulatory change is likely to have some impact on the business, but we believe we are well 
positioned to beneﬁt from market share gains in the medium to long term, with our ability to adapt 
our leading proprietary technology and focus on client service and regulatory compliance supported 
by our ﬁnancial strength.”

6 7 whilst i am pleased to present the group’s results in our first 
full year since listing on the london stock exchange, there 
is no doubt that the past year has been challenging and 
disappointing with net operating income down 5% and 
underlying profit before tax down 22%. whilst the group’s policy is to pay dividends of 50% 
of underlying profit after tax, given the group’s strong cash 
position, the board has decided to maintain the full year total 
ordinary dividend in line with the prior year. we have commenced 
a thorough search for a successor. this has included embracing the internet and new technologies 
including mobile and adapting to regulatory change. we have 
made strong progress on our five strategic initiatives outlined 
for our investors during the listing process, including signing 
of a partnership with anz, launching new products (binaries 
and knock-outs) and continuing to develop our award winning 
next generation platform. the flexibility of our next generation 
platform means that we are able to quickly adapt the platform’s 
functionality to meet these new requirements. 83

no. these consultations were initiated as a result of 
low-quality providers applying low levels of regulatory 
compliance, questionable sales practices and irresponsible 
behaviour, primarily from overseas jurisdictions. the recent german regulatory consultation has resulted in the 
regulator maintaining its initial position which requires the 
implementation of negative balance protection for retail clients 
by 10 august 2017, whereby clients cannot lose more than 
their account balance. we are developing additional 
stockbroking platform functionality, and increasing the property 
and hardware capacity needed to support the anticipated rise in 
trading activity and staffing required to service the client base. our risk management 
strategy is based on highly-automated flow management, 
dynamically hedging net client exposures and risk.
