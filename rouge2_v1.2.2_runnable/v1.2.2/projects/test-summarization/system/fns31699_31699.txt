i am pleased to report that the group has delivered another strong set of annual results, with 
revenue growing by 19.5% to ¬£2,379m and underlying earnings per share increasing by 31% 
to 20.3 pence per share. the consolidation of tfs added a 
further 30 bps, bringing the group margin to 6.8%. t otal revenue increased by 11.7% on a constant currency basis, including like-for -like 
sales growth of 3.1%, net contract gains of 6.0% and a negative impact of 0.3% from the 
additional leap year day in 2016. the tfs business contributed a further 2.9% to revenue. net contract gains were 6.0% in the year , an encouraging increase from last year‚Äôs gains 
of 1.7%. we have a deep understanding of the diverse needs of travellers and 
operate a broad portfolio of more than 450 brands and concepts,

international and local high street brands, through to our own 
proprietary brands and bespoke restaurant concepts. m

. allied to this, our strategic initiatives have delivered further operational 
improvements and margin growth. increasing passenger numbers around the world, both in the airport 
and rail sectors, provide significant structural growth opportunities. like-for -like growth in the air sector has again been stronger than the rail sector, driven by 
increasing passenger numbers in most of our markets. this identified a core market of ¬£13.8bn in 2013, 
which includes airports and railway stations globally but excludes rail in north 
america. +.
