focusing innovation on  
patients and customers
in 2017, shire started its first full financial 
year as a transformed company: the 
undisputed global leader in treating 
rare diseases. a clinical pipeline with 20 
programs in 2013, ended 2017 with 40 
such active programs. and our therapeutic 
footprint had expanded into three new 
dynamic areas: immunology, hematology, 
and oncology. we had a global manufacturing portfolio 
that required careful pruning and 
disciplined, efficient management. the implementation of our network 
manufacturing study laid the foundation 
for efficient and effective supply operations. and at the same time, shire exceeded its 
challenging integration synergy targets for 
the year, saving money and managing its 
global procurement systems in the most 
cost-effective and efficient manner. and the pharmaceutical industry must still 
manage societal challenges in funding, 
pricing, and identifying ways to support 
future innovation. commercial spotlight:

measure under u.s. gaap is diluted earnings per ads. for a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the most directly 
comparable measure under u.s. gaap, see pages 179 to 183. we 
expect to deliver mid-single digit product 
sales growth in 2018 after absorbing the 
anticipated impact of generics. political volatility
the current political environment, in 
particular the evolving policy dynamics in 
the u.s. and the uncertainty associated 
with brexit in the uk, has increased 
ambiguity regarding the direction of the 
pharmaceutical market. additionally, unfavorable 
press coverage on topics such as drug 
pricing and marketing practices continues 
to attract scrutiny from regulators, and has 
negatively impacted public sentiment 
towards the industry. as we continue to focus on 
execution and integration, our 
2018 capital allocation priorities 
include debt reduction to a level 
to maintain an investment grade 
credit profile. strategic report

principal risks  
and uncertainties
shire’s risk management strategy is to identify, 
assess, manage, and monitor significant risks 
that it faces. 2  this is a non gaap financial measure. 3  this is a non gaap financial measure. 6  this is a non gaap financial measure. 7  this is a non gaap financial measure. we 
significantly advanced our research and 
development (r&d) pipeline with 54 
major market filings around the world 
and continued to invest in areas where 
we see great need and opportunity such 
as immunology. the hemophilia market landscape shifted, 
and continues to change rapidly. the global 
political, tax, and regulatory environment in 
which we operate is constantly in motion. towards that end, we continue to evaluate 
the strategic and operational direction of 
the company, including an assessment 
of our neuroscience business. as we began the year, the integration of 
baxalta was well under way. shire has transformed itself, but with this 
transformation came obvious challenges. in many countries we had to consolidate 
two offices into one, moving and 
reassigning experienced staff, while 
maintaining commercial momentum. and we set aggressive targets for our 
teams, pushing ourselves to meet the 
highest possible financial goals, some 
of which were clearly aspirational. internal audit
provides independent assurance 
that risk management, 
governance, and internal control 
processes are designed and 
operating effectively. global issues and  
crisis management
responsible for operating 
a global issues and crisis 
management framework. board of directors
ensures comprehensive risk management 
and internal control systems are in place 
and operating effectively. implement risk management 
processes, procedures, 
controls, and reporting. our vision 
is to be an innovation-driven biotech company applying our core scientific 
platforms to develop and deliver best-in-class therapies across our 
franchises in immunology, hematology, neuroscience, internal medicine, 
genetic diseases, oncology and ophthalmics. we focus on diseases 
and patient populations with the highest unmet needs and use our global 
infrastructure to reach people in more than 100 countries who 
are struggling to live their lives to the fullest. a detailed description 
of shire’s commitment to responsibility 
can be found on page 35.
the accomplishments — focused squarely 
on delivering benefits to patients in need 
and the communities in which we live — 
came during a year of substantial external 
regulatory and macroeconomic challenge. for more information about the two 
divisions, please see page 12. 
innovation at the heart of our 
vision and culture 
our long-term vision is to be an innovation-
driven biotech company focused on rare 
diseases and specialized conditions across 
our core scientific platforms and 
therapeutic areas.
