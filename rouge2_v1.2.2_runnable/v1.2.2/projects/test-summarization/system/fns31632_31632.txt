nised growth in interest and spending on leisure activities, our 282 restau-
rants, cafés and pubs are important drivers of footfall and trading in our 
locations. macro-economic uncertainties are now showing signs of slowing 
potential occupiers’ decision–making processes. long-term rewards of a long-term 
strategy

our business
over the 31 years since shaftesbury was formed, we have assembled 
an impossible-to-replicate portfolio in the heart of london’ s 
west end of some 600 buildings across 14½ acres. the board is delighted 
to recommend a final dividend of 8.1p, bringing the total 
distribution for the year to 16.0p, an increase of 8.8%. t ogether , 
these factors have contributed to an increase in epra 
earnings
1
 of £6.2 million to £45.2 million, which equates to 
an increase in epra earnings per share1 of 15.7%. commer cial and r esi dential

sq.ft. the renowned 
and enduring appeal of london’ s west end to a global audience 
of visitors and businesses brings a resilience to its economy not 
seen elsewhere in the uk and in very few cities across the world. focus on culture, governance 
and sustainability 
in my first year with shaftesbury, i have come to appreciate the 
culture of this business and the important part it plays in supporting 
our strategy and our continuing success. the board and i are committed to maintaining the high standards 
of corporate governance and behaviour we have demonstrated 
for many years. my responsibility is to ensure 
that the board’ s membership continues to evolve so that we 
have access to the broad skills and experience required to 
support the current and future needs of the business. focussed on restaurants, leisure and retail,  
our exceptional portfolio is clustered mainly  
in carnaby, seven dials and chinatown, but  
also includes substantial ownerships in east and  
west covent garden, soho and fitzrovia. ft. of restaurant, 
leisure and retail space that we own in high profile, popular locations. with our forensic knowledge of the west end, we curate 
distinctive, interesting and lively destinations which attract 
londoners, a large and important local working population, 
domestic visitors, and international tourists in numbers 
unmatched by any city destination in the western world. we pride ourselves in being open, transparent and engaged, 
not just with shareholders but also with our wide array of 
stakeholders, including our employees, local communities, 
neighbours and local authorities. our objective is to deliver 
long-term growth in rental income, capital  
values and shareholder returns. continuing value creation and 
income growth
our portfolio, now valued
1
 at £3.64 billion, continues to deliver 
rental and capital growth, but with relatively low capital 
expenditure. we have continued our long record of crystallising our portfolio’ s 
reversionary potential into contracted cash flow, whilst growing 
this potential further. together with significantly reduced finance 
costs following important refinancing activity, this has driven 
strong growth in earnings over the year. see page 140
