renewable energy projects
typically involve electricity
generation assets which
produce green energy and
benefit from long-term
governmental support
mechanisms alongside
income for the amount
of power produced. opportunities in other
infrastructure markets
in sectors closely linked to
ppp and renewable energy. these include areas such as
high speed broadband and
water resource management. infrastructure can be defined as the physical assets and systems that support a country or
community. we committed capital to each of our three core regions –
asia pacific, europe and north america – in the year. our primary investment teams benefit from a robust and
diverse pipeline of future opportunities in each of the three
regions where we currently operate: north america (canada
and the us); asia pacific (australia and new zealand); and
europe (including the uk). north america: six of the nine shortlisted ppp positions •
are for potential investments in north america. the most active
province is ontario, especially in the transport sector. >

since i became chairman in january 2010, john laing has
evolved significantly in a number of ways: it’s a simpler business,
with non-core activities divested; it’s a much more international
business, with three well-established geographical regions
and the potential for expansion into further jurisdictions; and
it’s a stronger business, with the ability to access new capital,
having undertaken a successful ipo three years ago. our investment commitments for 2017 are summarised in the table below:

our international reach
john laing has a well-established presence in each of its
chosen overseas markets: asia pacific, north america and
europe, including the uk. we entered 2018 with strong positions
in nine shortlisted ppp consortiums and with four exclusive
renewable energy opportunities. while the
political climate in the uk is currently not favourable
towards ppp, it only accounts for 5% of our total pipeline. our international
growth continued with all our investment commitments being
made outside the uk, including the following:
i-66 managed lanes (us) – £118.0 million •
rocksprings wind farm (us) – £62.9 million •
new grafton correctional centre (australia) – £79.3 million •
melbourne metro (australia) – £43.1 million. 02 / john laing annual report and accounts 2017
key performance indicators (kpis) and highlights
we aim to deliver predictable returns and to
actively manage and reduce risk across our
primary and secondary investment portfolios. operational investments can be sold to secondary
market investors who target a lower rate of return
consistent with the reduction in risk for assets
that have completed construction. these realisations release capital to recycle
into primary investment opportunities. alternatively, investments can be retained in
the portfolio after construction to generate a
cash yield and also offer potential for further
value enhancement from changes that improve
project cash flow. as at 31 december 2017, we held a portfolio of 41 investments in infrastructure •
projects in 9 countries with a book value of £1,184 million. plus a shareholding in jlen (a listed environmental asset investment fund) •
valued at £10 million, making an overall investment portfolio of £1,194 million. kpis
