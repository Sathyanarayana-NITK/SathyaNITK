consistent with the way financial performance is measured by management. business progress
we continued to implement our strategy of growth through
business transformation. your board has given its backing to
targeted acquisitions that will help us conﬁrm our status as a
leading player in the global networked it services market. we are now, for example, meeting almost
all our uk electricity needs from environmentally friendly
sources, including wind generation, solar, wave and
hydroelectric schemes. i’d like to thank our
employees for making that programme happen. that’s
why an ability to embrace, and thrive on, change – developing
new products and services, new ways of working and new ways
of interacting with our customers – is essential to what we do
at bt. when so much is changing, companies have to be crystal
clear about what they stand for. our wider responsibilities
our aim as a communications company is to operate in a
socially responsible and sustainable way and to ensure that we
help everyone beneﬁt from improved communications and
enhanced connectivity. we continued to invest signiﬁcantly in
technologies and systems designed to transform our
customers’ experience, at the same time as generating free
cash ﬂow of £1.6 billion. their needs and
expectations are constantly changing, so too is the market in
which we operate and the technology at our disposal. our mission is to be the leader in delivering converged
networked services. the successor to the statutory corporation
british telecommunications, it was incorporated in england and wales as a public limited company, wholly owned by the uk government, as a result of the telecommunications act 1984.
between november 1984 and july 1993, the uk government sold all of its shareholding in british telecommunications plc in three public offerings. this is the annual report for the year ended 31 march 2006. it complies with uk regulations and is the annual report on form 20-f for the us securities and exchange commission to meet us
regulations. this annual report has been sent to shareholders who have elected to receive a copy. a separate annual review and notice of meeting (including summary ﬁnancial statements) for the year
ended 31 march 2006 has been issued to all shareholders. our principal activities include networked it
services, local, national and international telecommunications services, and
higher-value broadband and internet products and services. in the uk, we serve
around 20 million business and residential customers, as well as providing
network services to other operators. british telecommunications plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of bt group plc and encompasses virtually all the businesses and assets of the bt group. and in the uk, we now have almost eight
million broadband lines over which we are able to offer
customers exciting, next-generation voice and entertainment
services. annual
