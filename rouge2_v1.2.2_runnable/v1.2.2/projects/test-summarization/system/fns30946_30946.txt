our business model has been designed 
to be successful in the dynamic 
digital distribution segment of the uk 
insurance market, and it is underpinned 
by sophisticated it systems, which 
are driving our strong track record of 
sustainable growth. the group operates across the insurance 
value chain with clear separation to 
ensure the underwriting business 
focuses on pricing the risk whilst the 
retail business maximises customer 
conversion and value, without impacting 
underwriting profi tability. pricing capabilities are at the heart 
of the retail business model, with a 
team of highly specialised decision 
scientists who are empowered to drive 
sophisticated pricing structures and 
assess overall customer lifetime value. underwriting has a disciplined approach 
with expertise in risk selection, which 
combined with award winning counter 
fraud capabilities enables sustainable 
and profi table growth, delivering a 
strong loss ratio at or below our target 
range of 75-79%. target as at 31 december 2017

it’s been a year since rmi 
acquired 29.9% of the company. in the time that i have been here, live 
customer policies (lcp) have more than 
doubled – from 1.1 million in 2012 to over 
2.6 million today – and our colleague 
numbers have increased to over 3,100. 
another key highlight is rmi’s investment 
of 29.9% in hastings. maintaining 
our momentum
hastings group holdings plc 
annual report 2017 maintaining 
our momentum
since we sold our first policy 20 years ago hastings 
has become one of the fastest growing general 
insurance providers in the uk. we are proud to now 
have over 2.6 million live customer policies and to 
employ over 3,100 colleagues across sites in bexhill, 
leicester, london and gibraltar. this allows us to invest in the communities we serve and be 
a responsible member of the fi nancial services community. underwriting have developed and launched a 
new home proposition and started to underwrite 
home insurance as lead insurer during 2017. 
this has started with low volumes initially to test, 
learn and build capabilities, including people, 
data and models. retail is also benefitting from the continued 
growth in its share of new business sales via pcw, 
combined with a profitable maturing renewal book 
and retention rates which remain strong and above 
the market average of circa 70%. “ our digitally focused 
business model is built for 
how customers increasingly 
want to buy their general 
insurance.”
