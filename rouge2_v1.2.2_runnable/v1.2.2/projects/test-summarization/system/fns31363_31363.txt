business model 
and strategy
in some cases, this might be through the expansion 
of the venues network in connecticut where there 
are 16 existing sites with a licence to expand to 24 
and through the expansion of the intra-state web and 
mobile pari-mutuel betting channels in connecticut. included within racing and digital is the nascent 
bump 50:50 business. sportech venues operates all legal betting on 
horseracing, greyhound racing and jai alai under 
an exclusive and in perpetuity licence for retail, 
telephone, internet and mobile in the state of 
connecticut. the current board recognises stakeholder concern 
regarding previous investment venture returns 
and a track record of impairing investments, 
which unfortunately continued in 2017 as the book 
valuations of various historic investments have yet 
again had to be revalued downwards. 170749 sportech front end 27 april.indd   9 27/04/2018   20:30 10

a number of provisions have been made for onerous 
contracts or potential bad debts as this process 
unfolded. the jv was almost 
dormant in 2017, and by february 2018, the 
jv was terminated as minimal revenues were 
recognised, and the jv had ongoing costs with 
limited potential for returns. this site had not been 
developed, currently lies vacant and during 2017 
a further provision of £1.2 million was made for 
the onerous lease and other associated liabilities. the 
registrar should be notified promptly of any change 
in a shareholder’s address or other details. the group does not hedge against its usd earnings, 
but will report translation differences. following a positive litigation 
ruling and the sale of our core 
uk business, the group repaid 
£60 million of debt and returned 
£75 million to shareholders, whilst 
having sufficient cash to facilitate 
immediate growth prospects 
during the year. the board anticipates 
further growth in usd contributions going forward 
and the board will be evaluating whether the 
reporting currency for the group should become the 
us dollar. the board wishes to acknowledge directors who 
departed the board in 2017: roger withers (who had 
served as chairman), ian penrose (chief executive) 
and mickey kalifa (cfo). adjusted ebitda £0.5 million 
(2016: £0.2 million). developments
the bump 50:50 business continued its multi-year 
growth trajectory in 2017, signing 25 new customers 
including the official charitable foundations of the 
atlanta braves (mlb®), columbus blue jackets 
(nhl®), houston rockets (nba®), las vegas 
golden knights (new franchise team of the nhl®), 
pittsburgh pirates (mlb®), new york jets (nfl®), and

1. contribution is defined as gross profits, less marketing and distribution costs. 2. adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation, share option charges  
and separately identifiable items as reported in notes 6 and 7 of the financial review. 3. adjusted profit from continuing operations is the aggregate of adjusted ebitda normalised share option 
charges, depreciation, amortisation (excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles), and finance charges  
(see note 17 of the financial review). this site is regularly updated 
to provide information about the group. the group’s 
press releases and announcements can be found on 
the site. in the past, these have been 
primarily “pari-mutuel” in 
nature. the group views “exceptional 
items” as simply that, items that are exceptional in 
nature and size (the de minimis being the materiality 
threshold applied by the auditors) and which if to 
recur, are not, therefore, exceptional, or separately 
reported items which we understand to be the 
preferred usage of the frc. 20 balderton street
