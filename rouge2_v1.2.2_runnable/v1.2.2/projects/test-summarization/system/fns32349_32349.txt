order to allocate them more appropriately to our market segments. we have a total of approximately 145,000 
consumer and business customers in this segment. the anticipated decline in revenue generated from our contact 
centre and media services has continued and we expect this 
contribution to further reduce over the next year. while we have seen early signs of revenue 
growth in this segment, margins were held back in the year, as 
we recognised the impact of incurred and anticipated cost 
overruns on the development stages of two fixed price, complex 
software implementations for a single customer. connected to

proposed full year dividend  
(pence per share)
our operations in hull and 
east yorkshire deliver strong 
income and cash generation 
that allow us to make a clear 
dividend commitment. in september, we completed the extension of our banking 
arrangements, securing a facility of £180.0 million for a further 
five years through to december 2021, on existing favourable 
terms. our deployment is ahead of target and we expect to pass 
150,000 premises (more than two thirds of our addressable 
market) by december 2017.
during the year we have passed 45,000 premises, taking our 
total to 137,000 and take-up remains strong with 19,000 
premises connected in the year (including 1,400 businesses), 
taking the total connected to 43,000. 
revenue has increased from prior year by 3% in our consumer 
channel. we have refined our reporting segments to 
align with the way the business is run and how 
financial performance is measured. our strategy is designed to offer shareholders 
a combination of income generation and value accretion. this should deliver long-term sustainable cash 
generation, to continue to support our dividend policy. our enterprise business is focused on market areas, where we 
have seen good growth and where we have market leading skills. the conclusion from the evaluation was 
that we are operating effectively but there were some minor 
areas for improvement. we continue to seek ways to limit the effect of the decline and 
explore other solutions as appropriate. this medium-term certainty reduces the group’s risk and 
provides further opportunities for growth. underlying working capital was favourable year-on-year. what are we doing to mitigate the risk? what are we doing to mitigate the risk? what are we doing to mitigate the risk? what are we doing to mitigate the risk? how does this link to our strategy? how does this link to our strategy? how does this link to our strategy? how does this link to our strategy? kcom group plc
