∙ commercial negotiations on-going with multiple 
tanneries. our objective in doing so was to start meaningful 
discussions with major oems, which are now underway. these 
developments are a significant step forward for transitioning 
tanneries from trials to contract and implementation. this has been 
validated by the contract signed with wollsdorf leder in 
july 2017 and in other ongoing commercial negotiations. adjusted gross profit/loss and adjusted ebitda are considered 
the key financial performance measures of the group as they 
reflect the true nature of our continuing trading activities. this r&d spend was all expensed during the period as 
it represents group expenditure on textiles, domestic laundry 
development and tanning engineering development, none 
of which yet meet the full criteria for capitalisation of these 
costs in accordance with ias 38. when these business areas 
are deemed to have met the ias 38 capitalisation criteria 
ongoing development costs will be capitalised. the board performs regular reviews of 
actual results against budget, and monitors cash balances 
on a regular basis to ensure that the business has sufficient 
resources to enact its current strategy. certain qualitative 
measures, such as the performance of product development 
initiatives, are also monitored on a regular basis. john samuel
