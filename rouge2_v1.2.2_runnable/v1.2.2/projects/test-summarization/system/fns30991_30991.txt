ahead of schedule. the ergomed team screen up to 100 co-development

key secondary endpoints and was highly rated by 
investigators. the appointment of stephen stamp as ceo and dr jan 
petracek as coo was a catalyst for the re-aligned board to 
review ergomed’s growth opportunities and set strategic 
priorities which will see greater focus on the services business 
and a targeting of the company’s resources at those areas. peter george
