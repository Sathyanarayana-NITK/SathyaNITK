polar capital holdings plc is traded 
on the alternative investment 
market under the ticker ‘polr.ln’. in the uk, the ftse 100 index returned 23.3% over 
the year with many of the large companies in the index 
benefitting from a weak pound boosting their overseas 
earnings. while the firm’s 
revenues are all recorded in sterling the majority of the 
firm’s aum are not sterling denominated, with dollar assets 
being the dominant constituent. the firm has a policy to hedge 50% of its non-sterling 
revenues which has resulted in an overall dampening of 
the benefit of sterling’s weakness and accounts for the 
£2.4m loss on forward currency hedging contracts. • institutional robustness across 
operations, compliance, risk and 
relationship management. • culture which is flexible, 
entrepreneurial and transparent. in this context our reducing levels of net outflows provide 
grounds for encouragement. the 
focus will continue to be investment led with high alpha 
differentiated active product serving the needs of our 
clients, with capacity limits on funds appropriate to the 
underlying liquidity of the strategy. first interim dividend

for the year ended 31 march 2017
tim woolley
chief executive officer and founder
our chairman referred in his statement to the fact that last year was a disappointing year for active managers and that 
indeed many of our funds failed to beat their benchmarks. the group has a formal risk committee that convenes monthly and is chaired by the group’s chief risk officer 
(‘cro’) and comprises the chief executive, the chief operating officer, the global head of distribution and mr 
ashford-russell. strategic report

at a glance
polar capital is a specialist investment management group offering professional 
and institutional investors a range of geographical and sector funds. each investment strategy has a fundamental research driven approach. our philosophy
 • primacy of investment 
performance. • diversified yet complementary 
set of funds with a focus on 
fundamental research driven 
strategies. • environment for employees 
in which talent can flourish 
and be well rewarded. george 
godber was able to join us in april and be reunited with 
georgina as co-manager on the fund and momentum 
has continued to be strong with assets at the end of  
may over £256m. the simple lesson would seem to 
be that clients should back all our funds at launch and  
sit back and enjoy the long-term ride! i am excited at the prospect of handing over leadership 
of the company to gavin rochussen over the coming 
weeks. polar capital holdings plc annual report and accounts 2017

we added to our fund range in january 2017 with the uk value opportunities 
fund which raised over £100m on its launch and with assets over £256m at the 
end of may. since our year end our healthcare investment trust was successfully 
restructured resulting in a fund with £289m of aum. regulatory risk failure to comply with regulations, particularly those issued by the financial conduct 
authority or the london stock exchange, could result in the group losing the ability to 
operate as a regulated financial services business or its aim quotation being suspended  
or withdrawn. the group’s investment activities are regulated primarily by the financial conduct authority in the uk and the 
group is also subject to regulation in the various other jurisdictions in which it operates. in the context of the 
current regulatory environment, the board believes its regulated business has sufficient resources for compliance 
monitoring and to take corrective action when warranted. the group seeks to operate within applicable financial conduct authority principles, rules and regulations and 
those issued by the london stock exchange to govern the trading of the company’s shares on aim. 4235369

leadership changes
on behalf of the other board members and the entire staff 
at polar, i would like to thank tim woolley, co-founder of 
the business, who will be standing down as chief executive 
in july, for his leadership in so successfully guiding us 
through many challenges over the past seven and a half 
years. annual general meeting
once again our agm will be held at our offices at  
16 palace street, london, sw1e 5jd. stock markets around the world were surprisingly buoyant 
over the period although this was not reflected in flows 
into active equity funds as it was another challenging year 
for the industry with passive products continuing to take 
market share. the four strategies that suffered 
outflows were japan, gems and north america on the 
long-only side and european long/short on the absolute 
return side. although the main japan ucits fund experienced 
further substantial outflows, it is pleasing to see a sharp 
improvement in the fund’s performance over the last 
twelve months as the team’s style has returned to favour. the outflows on our 
north america fund were due to short-term client tactical 
allocation decisions away from the us market rather than 
relating to fund performance, which continues to be 
strong and well ahead of benchmark over most periods 
and since launch.
