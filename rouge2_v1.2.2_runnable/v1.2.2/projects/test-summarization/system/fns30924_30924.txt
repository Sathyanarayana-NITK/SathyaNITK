ceo’s report
shortly after my appointment in march 2017 we set out three key strategic priorities critical to enhancing our 
capital allocation discipline:
• earlier and broader syndication of our subsidiaries, focusing on strategic investors, where we see scope for 
valuable validation and acceleration or de-risking of the path to commercialisation and monetisation;
• strengthened leadership, governance and accountability at our subsidiary businesses, including changes in 
personnel where required, additional board and advisory board members, and clearer accountability for 
tangible milestone delivery; and
• a transition to thematic investing, focusing on theses and areas of competitive advantage, and on deeper 
relationships with a smaller number of research institutions aligned to these areas. omar amirana, md, senior vice president, life sciences investments, has focused on investment theses 
revolving around proprietary minimally-invasive solutions for procedures with a clear reimbursement path that 
reduce morbidity, mortality and costs. we believe each of our top six subsidiaries 
has strong sources of sustainable competitive advantage, including via patent portfolios which were markedly 
strengthened in 2017. the highly capable, experienced management teams have the necessary mix of technical 
and commercial skills, and have a clear line of sight to the critical goals and inflection points necessary to drive 
value and maximise exit optionality. i look forward to 2018 as a year in which we consolidate the hard work undertaken in 2017 and deliver further 
demonstrable progress against our objectives. in march 2017 the board appointed jill smith as president and chief executive officer (ceo). non-executive director rick davis will retire and not seek re-election at the agm to be held in may 2018 
after completing over seven years of service to the company. further, we strengthened leadership at several of our subsidiaries, 
including the appointment of two new ceos, tom sparkman at spin transfer and barry matsumori at bridgesat. simon davidson joined the team in june as executive vice president, technology investments, bringing extensive 
experience working with federal laboratories and government customers. corporate partnership highlights
• on 30 october 2017, allied-bristol life sciences, llc, a biopharmaceutical enterprise jointly owned by 
allied minds and bristol-myers squibb company announced that it had formed a new subsidiary, abls iv, 
to enter into an alliance with weill cornell medicine and an exclusive licensing agreement with cornell 
university in relation to a novel class of inhibitors of immunoproteasomes. tom is a veteran 
of the semiconductor industry who has held ceo and senior executive roles at spansion, integrated device 
technologies, and maxim integrated products. harry was responsible for life 
sciences investments at both foundation and canaan. additionally, the company has established certain partnerships and alliances with us corporations, including 
bristol myers squibb (bms) (via allied- bristol life sciences, llc (abls)) and ge ventures, which provide us 
with access to technology, expertise and capital. • on 16 october 2017, spin transfer technologies and tokyo electron ltd. announced that they signed 
an agreement for a collaborative engineering program for next-generation static random-access memory 
(sram) and dynamic random-access memory (dram)-class spin-torque magnetoresistive random-access 
memory (st-mram) devices. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in value at 
bridgesat and federated wireless demonstrated by the consummation of third-party fundraisings. problem statement – rf cannot meet exponential growth in demand for satellite data downlink
leo satellite data downlink demand is expected to grow over 125% annually through 2024, as a result of an 
expected three-fold increase in number of satellites by 2022 carrying a broader range of data-intensive sensors. hawkeye

in addition allied minds is party to an agreement with ge ventures establishing a strategic alliance through 
which the two parties envisage cooperating to jointly invest in technologies from their pipelines. based 
in boston, allied minds supports its businesses with capital, management, expertise and shared services. the substantial and decisive actions undertaken since her appointment position the group well to 
deliver against these priorities. in the first half of the year, the decision was made to rationalise the portfolio of subsidiary companies. this was 
completed after careful review of the capital requirements, competitive position and market opportunities facing 
each company.
