affordability for low income families buying a gleeson home 
remained attractive and mortgage availability continued 
to support the young first time buyers who make up a large 
proportion of gleeson homes buyers. land
we remain one of the few developers building low cost homes 
on brownfield sites in challenging communities and such 
sites continue to be available at relatively low cost. gleeson homes continues to build significant value for shareholders as well as delivering a unique social benefit in helping 
people on lower incomes move from housing poverty caused by the ‘rent trap’ into home ownership and wealth creation. our homes are affordable enough to be sold to a couple on the current national living wage and quite often mortgage 
repayments are less than comparable council house rents. affordability remains very attractive and demand exceeds supply, with buyers queueing 
on site opening days. gleeson strategic land also had a record year and continues to benefit from strong 
demand for consented land in prime locations from both medium sized and large 
housebuilders. the division has a strong pipeline of sites, predominantly in the south 
of england, which have the opportunity of developing 21,505 plots, and anticipates 
continuing to enjoy a high level of success in promoting commercially attractive sites 
through the planning system. the board is confident in the group’s short and longer term outlook. gross margins on plot sales strengthened to 33.0% as a result 
of changes to site mix, increase in selling prices and robust 
cost controls resulting in a 16.9% increase in operating profit 
to £22.8m (2016: £19.5m). profit before tax increased by 17.0% to £33.0m (2016: 
£28.2m). earnings per share grew by 13.8% to 48.5p (2016: 42.6p). return on capital employed increased by 220 basis points to  
25.4% (2016: 23.2%). mj gleeson plc

chairman’s statement
gleeson homes exceeded 1,000 unit sales for the first time, 
increasing volumes by 12.1% to 1,013 units (2016: 904 units). gleeson strategic land increased operating profit by 17.6% 
to £12.0m (2016: £10.2m) by continuing to secure attractive 
residential planning consents and satisfying demand for 
development sites from both medium sized and large 
housebuilders. profit for the year attributable to equity holders  
of the parent company was £26.2m (2016: £23.0m). gleeson 
homes’ land pipeline grew by 2,304 plots and 24 sites to a 
record high of 141 sites (2016: 117), comprising 11,588 plots 
owned or conditionally purchased (2016: 9,284). the division 
will continue to commence building on sites as soon as a fully 
implementable planning permission is obtained. during the year it obtained 
planning consent on 6 sites; and entered agreements 
involving 6 new sites, potentially providing development 
opportunities on an additional 1,846 plots. through establishing strong relationships with local authorities, gleeson homes has created a ‘virtuous 
circle’ in which it acquires and redevelops legacy sites where there is an obvious need for social and economic 
regeneration and builds homes at affordable prices, thus enabling home ownership. this ‘virtuous circle’ will continue to 
underpin the business and allows for future geographic expansion. key features of the gleeson homes business model
► community regeneration: over the years, gleeson homes has played a key role in regenerating challenging 
communities. we make it our priority to make the house buying process 
fully transparent to our customers:
• we charge a fee of £200 for covering our costs for vetting 
architects’ drawings and giving permissions for extensions 
and conservatories but we do not charge for minor 
permissions. gleeson homes prides itself in being active in the 
communities in which it operates. we look forward to delivering our new 
target of doubling gleeson homes volumes to 2,000 p.a.
