morgan advanced materials 
supplies precision-engineered 
materials, components and 
assemblies to meet the 
exacting standards of the 
international security and 
defence markets. our focus on 
meeting customer requirements and demands 
in the harshest environments is key to the 
success of this collaboration. these adjusted measures are not recognised under ifrs or other generally accepted 
accounting principles (gaap). throughout this report these non-gaap measures are clearly identified by an asterisk (*) where they appear in text, 
and by a footnote where they appear in tables and charts. definitions and reconciliations of these non-gaap 
measures to the relevant gaap measures can be found in the group financial review on pages 41 to 44. 2. lost-time accident frequency has been subject to assurance by erm certification and verification services. we work in the electronics, energy, 
healthcare, industrial, petrochemical,  
security and transport markets, forming close 
collaborative relationships with our customers. in addition to these principal product ranges, 
morgan also offers application-specific products 
for each of its target markets. these 
attributes are helping to reduce industrial 
waste, improve safety and lower 
environmental impact. these 
technology advantages have been shown to 
increase casting yields when compared to 
alternative materials on the market. financial

  annual report 2017 morgan advanced materials 07 1. throughout the annual report, including the strategic report, adjusted measures are used to describe the group’s 
financial performance. on an organic constant-currency basis*, 
revenues increased by 1.4%, and the balance 
sheet was stronger at the end of the year due to 
better operational management and disposals 
with net debt* reducing to £181.3 million from 
£242.5 million in 2016. despite disposals of 
mature assets with good margins the operating 
profit margin was stable with the negative effects 
of those disposals offset by operating efficiencies 
and higher revenues. the proposed dividend is 
unchanged at 1 1.0p per share. see page 50 for further details. it was very disappointing to see a road accident 
in the usa which injured 19 of our employees, 
some of them seriously. nineteen employees 
were injured in this incident. see pages 30 to 39 for 
further details.
