■ sustainability. we proactively invest in ensuring that the
environments where we do business are continually protected and improved, and seek to minimise
any damage our activities may cause. our speciality crops continue to provide an excellent return which once again
demonstrates the beneﬁts of our diversiﬁed agricultural strategy. our ﬁnancial position is strong and following our withdrawal from the uk ﬁnancial services market
our ﬁnancial risks are substantially reduced. trading in 2017 was mixed with a weak start being followed by a much better second half. our tea
operations performed well as good yields combined with an improving tea price as the year progressed. however, for the second year running, the macadamia crop was impacted by drought which led to
disappointing volumes. furthermore, changing weather patterns led to a severe drought in the cape and
kenya, ﬂooding in bangladesh and an unprecedented hurricane season in the caribbean. from the outset, camellia’s ethos has been based on the highest
moral and professional integrity, and a commitment to doing the right thing – ethically and commercially,
globally and locally. we are deeply committed to improving the long-term stability
and well-being of our businesses, the communities and the environments in which we operate. we are committed not only to the ultimate welfare of our employees but also to the
communities in which they live. eastern produce malawi won a social
sustainability gold award at the north american tea sustainability awards for its diversity, inclusion and
women’s welfare policy in line with the un sustainable development goal 5, “to achieve gender equality
and empowerment of women and girls”. camellia plc     annual report 2017
