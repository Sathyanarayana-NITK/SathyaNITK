we also increased our investment 
in the uk’s second city, birmingham, through the 
acquisition of grand central shopping centre in joint 
venture with cppib. this year we successfully relocated our uk offices  
to more cost-efficient sites, moving our london 
headquarters to kings place, king’s cross. we also made good progress at our 
major london development schemes. the 
next 18 months will also see us make advancements on 
our major london development schemes including 
moving towards starting on-site at brent cross and 
croydon. asset management
we skilfully manage our portfolio in a sustainable  
way to generate income growth and to attract tenants  
and shoppers
investment management
we employ market expertise to recycle our portfolio. how is the investment proposition 
for shareholders in 2016 
differentiated versus peers? as well as 
owning prime real estate, driving rental growth requires 
a thorough and hands-on approach to asset 
management. these schemes are set to deliver retail assets 
of the future and further differentiate our long-term 
investment proposition. this enables us to once more increase the dividend for 
our shareholders, which at 22.3p per share is up 9 .3%  
on last year and with compound annual growth of 7 .7% 
since 2011.
nav per share was up 11% principally due to a total 
property return of 12.4%, significantly beating ipd . we saw visitor numbers up 1.1% in uk shopping 
centres this year. this result was encouraging and we 
outperformed the wider market, which was down 1.9% 
year-on-year (according to springboard). this was 
nearly double the market level of 2.3%. our portfolio includes investments in prime shopping 
centres in the uk and france, convenient retail parks in the uk  
and premium outlets across europe. we own, operate and develop retail destinations that 
interact seamlessly with digital and bring together the very best retail, leisure 
and entertainment brands. with the growth in 
multichannel retailing, tenants are looking to position a 
greater share of their stores in the best locations. retailers are also creating more innovative store 
designs and formats. 21 shopping centres
