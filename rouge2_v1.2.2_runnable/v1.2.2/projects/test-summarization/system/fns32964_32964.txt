somaliland, with a population of 3.5 
million, declared independence in 1991. 
though not internationally recognised, 
somaliland has a working political system, 
government institutions, a police force 
and its own currency. in partnership with a local ngo, in the 
communities around taq taq 42 young 
men received training on air conditioning 
units and repairs and maintenance using 
electrical tools. in addition, 50 farmers 
were trained to take advantage of new 
farming techniques. working with the sulaimaniyah educational 
department, a team from genel led 100 
students to hawari shar public park. the unfortunate events 
in the kri in the last quarter of the year and 
the subsequent material reduction in krg 
exports caused by these events significantly 
disrupted the status quo. the successful peshkabir-2 
well was followed by the equally successful 
peshkabir-3 well, and production of c.5,000 
bopd from the former was commingled with 
the latter to end the year at a very consistent 
15,000 bopd from the field. working with 
the operator, we will continue to focus 
on peshkabir in 2018. 
the peshkabir-4 well spud in february, 
and will potentially be followed by a further 
five wells in 2018. field production is 
expected by the operator to reach 30,000 
bopd by the summer and continue to ramp 
up in the second half of the year. this is 
very encouraging, and when added to the 
robust production from the main tawke 
field, highly cash-generative. i am now more confident than ever that, 
while challenges remain, there is material 
upside in the genel portfolio and significant 
opportunities ahead. as we enter 2018, 
i believe that we have both the right strategy 
to take advantage of these and the right 
management team to deliver on that strategy. there are exciting opportunities available 
for cash-generative, proactive companies, 
and the board and management carried out 
a comprehensive review of genel strategy in 
order to define a clear and focused roadmap 
to creating significant shareholder value. side by side with this focus on cost, is a 
focus on operational capability. in 2017 we welcomed tim bushell and martin 
gudgeon to the board, adding relevant skills 
and experience. despite operational activity at the tawke psc 
being focused on maximising the potential 
of peshkabir, general tawke field production 
was solid in 2017. work done at taq taq 
also provided encouragement. 2p reserves 
more than doubling at peshkabir also 
bolstered reserves at the tawke psc, 
and prudent expenditure will allow ongoing 
cash generation from across the genel 
portfolio for years to come. below: operations at taq taq genel energy

stephen whyte
chairman
i am pleased to welcome 
you to genel’s seventh 
annual results statement, 
and my first as chairman. in the 
year, monthly payments totalling $263 
million were received from the krg, with 
our ongoing focus on cost and disciplined 
capital allocation helping to convert 
this into $142 million in free cash flow, 
before bond interest payments. this figure was boosted in the second half 
of the year by additional proceeds received 
under the rsa. under the rsa, genel 
receives override payments of 4.5% of tawke 
gross psc revenues for the five year period 
from 1 august 2017 to 31 july 2022, while 
capacity building payments (‘cbp’) on the 
profit share element of our tawke entitlement 
are eliminated over the entire life of the field. annual report 2017

our purpose
who we are
genel energy is the largest holder 
of reserves and resources in the 
kurdistan region of iraq, where 
we have been operating for 
over a decade. material free cash flow generation 
from our oil assets provides the 
ability to execute our strategy 
for growth. the macroeconomic climate altered again in 
2017. on the positive side, the increase in the 
oil price helped to boost cash flows from our 
producing assets, and also provided a more 
solid basis for the economy of the kurdistan 
region of iraq (‘kri’). however, despite the 
decrease in oil exports, the krg continued to 
demonstrate its ability and willingness to make 
payments, and genel has received payments 
for sales on a monthly basis since september 
2015. this has enabled investment by the 
company to continue. in 2017 genel delivered 
on that potential. genel energy

strategic report
a landmark year 
of delivery
murat özgül
chief executive officer
2017 was a successful year for genel 
energy. cash-generative oil assets
the receipt of 4.5% of gross tawke 
psc revenues means that the positive 
performance of peshkabir adds material cash 
flow to genel. 2017 activity
successful appraisal work at 
peshkabir added 43 mmbbls of gross 
2p resources, and updated cprs 
for bina bawi and miran stated a 
significant upgrade to the combined 
2c gross raw gas resources to 15 
tcf. our strategic 
ambition
to become a world-class 
independent e&p creator 
of shareholder value.  annualreport2017

strategic report governance financial statements other information
looking at genel from an external 
perspective it was clear that the company 
operated in a challenging environment, but 
it had demonstrated resilience while retaining 
real growth potential. the 
refreshed strategy focuses on the creation 
of shareholder value, providing growth 
opportunities while retaining a firm focus 
on prudent financial planning. our strategy builds on our core strengths – 
a robust and cash-generative asset portfolio, 
technical and commercial expertise, and our 
ability to leverage regional relationships and 
manage risk in complex areas. genel takes pride in its operations 
and strives for positive community impact, 
and it was pleasing to see a repeat of 2016’s 
performance in achieving no lost-time 
incidents, while reducing incidents of primary 
containment loss to a single minor event. to achieve this we must execute exploration 
and appraisal campaigns, successful m&a, deliver selective 
development projects, maximise production and free cash flow 
over the life of field, and be prepared to monetise at all points of 
the cycle. these strengths and capabilities 
were key drivers behind our excellent 
performance in 2017, and are transferrable 
to other regions. as we deliver on our strategy, we place 
robust corporate governance, excellence 
in hse, and a keen awareness of our place 
in the community at the heart of everything 
that we do. there were no injuries 
or spills. there were no injuries
