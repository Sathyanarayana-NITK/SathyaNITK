smirnovskoye
the smirnovskoye deposit is located in the
karabalyksky rayon, 120km north west of the
kostanay oblast and some 41km north of karabalyk,
the district centre in northern kazakhstan. the
village of smirnovka is in the immediate vicinity of
the deposit. we have entered into talks with interested parties
in particular with china molybdenum which has
expertise in processing our particular minerals. one of the key steps moving forward is to update
and more clearly define the resources. this drilling was
undertaken by an external geological firm and
the results of which will prove useful in bringing
partners on board to develop the site. we are keen to press forward with the plans for
development. k i r pl a l r t 2015

areas of exploration “the patience of shareholders
will be rewarded as we move
towards the production phase. of the loss £356,000 is
attributable to the head office, being administrative
costs of which the majority relates to maintaining
the professional fees and associated fees for
maintaining the london listing on the london
stock exchange. the
interest accrued on the loan in the current year has
been capitalised against the loan balance. the economics of moving to production have
changed as commodity prices have stabilised and
with the inclusion of lithium in the profit
generation models the projects are more
economically viable. this
will provide further external verification of the
resources on both sites. in terms of funding the company has sufficient
operational funds from its existing facility with
amrita investments. the company has been moving forward with the
development of the sites with a view to moving to
production. non-executive chairman
