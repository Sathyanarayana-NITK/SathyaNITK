up 47 .8% 2005 has been my first year as chairman
of hanson plc, having been appointed
to the role in april 2005. i am pleased to
be able to report that during 2005 the
group once again achieved excellent
progress against its primary objective,
which is to create sustainable, long-term
value for our shareholders. this, together with the interim dividend,
makes a total of 20p (1 8.1 5p) for the
year, an increase of 1 0.2%. 1m), equivalent to 1.1% (0.9%) of
outstanding shares. operating highlights
group turnover
†
increased by 9.8% to
£3,71 5.7m (£3,383.0m), of which 4.2%
was due to the acquisitions we made in
2005. excluding acquisitions, most of the
5.6% increase was due to increases in
selling prices. in the 
uk, capital expenditure includes kiln
refurbishment, plant automation and
information technology projects. energy costs, namely electricity, fuel and
gas, increased by over 20% in 2005. 
in addition, significant raw material
increases were incurred for cement,
bitumen and steel. ”

industry and markets
our industry
we supply heavy building materials and services to the public and private construction
sectors. end use markets and demand drivers
the end use of our products and services may be categorised into residential,
infrastructure, and industrial and commercial construction applications. our key products include aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt,
cement, concrete and steel pipe, precast concrete products, bricks and roof tiles. vertical integration in aggregates
in some markets, aggregates producers are integrated downstream into ready-mixed
concrete and asphalt production. ready-mixed concrete producers may
have upstream cement operations. our focus is on aggregates, but we own and operate ready-mixed concrete, asphalt
and cement operations where this is desirable. references to ‘we’ , ‘our’ or ‘us’ , unless the content
otherwise requires, is, in the context of a description
of the group’s businesses, operational activities 
or liabilities, a reference to those of the relevant
subsidiary company. references to hanson or the
company should, where appropriate, be construed
as a reference to the group or one or more of the
company’s subsidiaries. the market, industry and product segment data
contained in the annual report and form 20-f 
have been taken from industry and other sources
available to hanson in the relevant jurisdictions 
and, in some cases, adjusted based on relevant
management’s knowledge of the industry. hanson
has not independently verified any third-party
market information. at the scheme effective date new hanson
had no business assets. such factors include, but are not limited to, changes
in economic conditions, especially in the usa, the
uk and australia; changes in governmental policy
or legislation relating to public works expenditure
and housing; inclement weather conditions; the
competitive market in which we operate; changes 
in governmental policy or legislation that could
effect regulatory compliance and other operating
costs; disruption to, or increased costs of, the
supply of materials, energy and fuel to our business;
pension and post-retirement healthcare costs;
ineffective implementation of computer software
systems; our inability to achieve success in our
acquisition strategy; exchange rate fluctuations;
potential liabilities, including asbestos, arising 
out of former businesses and activities; adequacy 
of koppers’ environmental insurance and us
litigation exposure. our operating environment has continued
to change during the year, including
further consolidation of our customer and
competitor base. we are dedicated to delivering
increased value to all our constituents
(including shareholders, customers,
suppliers, fellow employees and the
communities in which we operate). such forward-looking
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors which could cause actual results and
developments to differ materially from future results
and developments expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. hanson does not undertake 
any obligation to update or revise publicly such 
forward-looking statements. corporate governance
although plans to introduce a mandatory
operating and financial review have
been shelved by the uk government, 
we are required to produce the equivalent
of an operating and financial review 
to satisfy us regulatory requirements. we remain fully compliant with section
404 of the us sarbanes-oxley act
ahead of the requirement for foreign 
us registrants. each of hanson, hanson aggregates north

is either a holding company or divisional entity, and
does not itself carry out any of the business activities
described on page 53 of the annual report and
form 20-f . both at a strategic and
at an operational level, hanson believes 
it is meeting these challenges. board of directors
after the agm in 2005, chris collins
stepped down as chairman. on your
behalf, i thank chris for his tremendous
contribution, initially as an executive
director of hanson and then as chairman. these translations should not be construed as
representations that the pound sterling amounts
actually represent such us dollar amounts or could
be converted into us dollars at the rates indicated. we have grown the group turnover,
earnings and margins of our existing
businesses in 2005 and have added
further value through a number of
significant acquisitions. we have
increased our dividend and share
buyback programme. 2005 performance summary
i am very pleased with the performance
we have delivered in 2005. we have
achieved double digit earnings growth,
completed a significant number of
valuable acquisitions and increased 
our returns to shareholders. in the usa, construction has begun 
on replacement pipe and precast
manufacturing plants in t exas, arizona
and florida and the construction of 
a new greenfield roof tile plant near
jacksonville in florida. in addition, 
we completed the quarry replant at
bridgeport, dallas and secured further
mineral reserves in california. plant
upgrades were completed in australia
and additional mineral reserves have
been secured in spain. in addition,
our aggregates acquisition strategy helps
maintain our long-term mineral reserves
and resources position, which totalled
1 5.9bn tonnes at the end of 2005. 
eleven transactions were completed 
in 2005 for a cash cost of £342.9m
