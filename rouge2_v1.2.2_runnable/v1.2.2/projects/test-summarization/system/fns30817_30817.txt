the board
on 2 january 2018 we were delighted to announce that mark johnstone 
will join the board as group chief executive on 1 april 2018. mark has a 
deep understanding of the group and the right strategic and operational 
experience, having held a number of senior roles at bba aviation over the 
last ten years. mark takes over from wayne edmunds, who stepped into 
the role on an interim basis on the departure of simon pryce in june 2017 . wayne will continue to be a member 
of the board but will not be regarded as an independent director and will 
not be a member of board committees. invested to position the network for future growth
we have committed capital expenditure to enhance the signature network 
through lease extensions, adding hangar space to satisfy customer 
requirements, and growing our non-fuel service offering. we have invested in 
our people and systems to support further service led growth. achieved steady state at ero
we have delivered a much improved performance at ero despite continuing 
challenging markets. determined the most appropriate capital structure for the group  
going forward
an extensive review has been undertaken and, based on the strong and 
robust cash flow fundamentals of the group, an increase in our target 
leverage range was deemed appropriate. this reflects the 
board’s progressive dividend policy and its continued confidence in 
bba aviation’s future prospects. the group 
remains disciplined in its approach to the allocation of capital, with 
the overriding objective being to enhance shareholder value. execution of actions 
associated with these goals is actively monitored by 
our management processes. our  
non-financial safety kpis are described on pages 24–29 in corporate responsibility. bba aviation – enabling flight;
