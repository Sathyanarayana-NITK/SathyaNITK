we understand 
that affordability for occupiers means sustainability for our business. our convenience‑led, community‑focused retail and 
leisure portfolio has proved well‑positioned and 
well‑placed in what has been an uncertain twelve

we believe that with our convenience and 
community focus, strong operational metrics, 
affordable rents and conservative balance sheet 
we are well‑positioned to continue to grow and 
deliver secure and sustainable cash returns to 
our shareholders. 12 newriver reit plc annual report and accounts 2017 the company showed agility in the acquisitions 
market over the year with the purchase of a major 
shopping centre in bexleyheath, south east london, 
a retail park in dumfries and a retail warehouse 
in sheffield. we have been active in the 
year since acquisition, improving rental tone in the 
shopping centre by 15% and working in partnership 
with the london borough of bexley to design 
a masterplan for the shopping centre, retail park 
and surrounding council owned land. in april 2017, 
following a comprehensive fit out, london based 
morleys department stores opened at the centre in 
the 40,000 sq ft unit formerly occupied by bhs. in order to facilitate the 
development, we recently agreed terms with lidl 
and iceland to surrender and relocate to sites 
adjacent to the shopping centre, as well as agreeing 
to re‑locate the local council owned library. our marketplace

the uk retail market is forecast to grow  
with convenience-driven categories leading 
the way for physical spend
• in 2016, total retail spend in the uk was £317.9bn, with physical sales 
and click & collect accounting for £276.1bn of total spend. • by 2021 total retail spend is forecast to increase to £362.4bn, with physical 
and click & collect sales accounting for £305.9bn, an increase of 11%. • by 2026 total retail spend is forecast to increase to £406.6bn, 
with physical and click & collect sales accounting for £332.9bn, 
a further increase of 9%. • although online penetration is forecast to increase from 14.8% to 18.0% 
by 2021 (and to 21.4% in 2026), convenience‑driven/non‑discretionary 
spend is forecast to remain resilient to the growth of online and has the 
strongest growth prospects across retail over the coming years. our high quality retail 
and leisure portfolio caters for the weekly needs of millions of uk 
wide shoppers, in turn creating desirable and profitable trading 
opportunities for our retail and leisure occupiers. retail represents 84% of our portfolio 
and notwithstanding the uncertain 
economic landscape, the uk retail 
market is forecast to continue to grow, 
with convenience‑driven categories 
dominating total physical store spend. in 2016, convenience and value retail 
operators accounted for the greatest 
share of new store openings. moreover, the physical store continues to 
be fundamental to the retail mix, with the 
top 10 multichannel retailers accounting  
for nearly 50% of total online sales. • with 64% of shoppers across newriver’s portfolio in 2017 aged 45 and 
over, newriver is well placed to benefit from this key growth segment  
of the population over the next ten years. notably, like‑for‑like 
footfall and occupancy levels both improved 
compared to the previous period. the board has therefore 
approved a further special dividend of 3.0 pence 
to be paid on 4 august 2017 to shareholders on the 
register on 16 june 2017. the ex‑dividend date will 
be 15 june 2017.
i am also delighted to announce that the first quarter 
dividend for fy18 will be increased to 5.25 pence 
per share (q1 fy17: 5.00 pence), payable on 
4 august 2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 16 june 2017. the ex‑dividend date will be 
15 june 2017.
as previously announced, chris taylor, senior 
independent director, stepped down from the board 
with effect from 9 april 2017. on behalf of newriver, 
i would like to thank chris for his major contribution

chief executive’s strategic review
“ our convenience‑led, 
community‑focused retail & 
leisure portfolio has proved 
well‑positioned in what has been 
an uncertain twelve months at 
the macro economic and 
political levels.”
this has been another outstanding year for 
newriver, which is reflected in a strong set of full 
year results. i would like to welcome all new shareholders joining 
the register as a result of these significant events. on behalf of the 
board, i would also like to thank newriver’s 
management and employees, whose hard work, 
enthusiasm and entrepreneurial flair delivered 
another strong performance. finally, i am grateful to 
the company’s advisers and shareholders for their 
continuing support. while the board is aware of general economic 
caution in light of uncertainty over brexit 
negotiations and the potential for rises in inflation 
and interest rates, it believes that newriver is 
well placed to meet the challenges that could 
arise in this environment. annual report and accounts 2017

newriver is one of the uk’s largest reits focused on the dynamic 
convenience‑led retail and leisure sectors. the change in name 
reflected the combination of the company’s 
portfolio now including both retail and leisure 
assets as well as its high dividend pay‑out ratio as 
a uk‑registered real estate investment trust. founding principles of active asset management and 
risk‑controlled development. the latter purchase subsequently 
generated cash receipts of £11.5 million, which, 
in accounting terms, fall within the definition of

*  this is the first year we have been included in the msci real estate databank, hence we cannot show our performance historically. • the ageing of the comparatively asset‑rich, baby‑boomer generation, 
means that spending and, in particular, spending through stores and 
click & collect, is set to be driven by the baby‑boomers. • older shoppers appreciate the ease of access and free parking offered 
by retail parks, which now constitute 14% of the newriver portfolio. since the company was founded in september 2009 we have hand‑picked 
a high quality and geographically diverse portfolio, catering to the day to day needs of our 
consumers, occupiers & communities. on admission to the main market, newriver reit plc 
became the ultimate parent company, replacing 
newriver retail limited.
