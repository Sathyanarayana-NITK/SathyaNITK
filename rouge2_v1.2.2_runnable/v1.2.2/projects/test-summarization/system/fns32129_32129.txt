water). these same 
trends have led to the pollution of 
water resources, further reducing 
the capacity of the natural water  
cycle to meet the world’s growing 
water demand. the problem with access to fresh 
water is not its finite volume but 
inadequate distribution which 
is largely dependent on economic 
resources. half a billion 
people live in regions where water 
consumption from underground 
aquifers is continuously depleted 
because abstraction is double the 
volume of water replenished by 
rain every year. strategic report

how we increase value
we have a portfolio of market-leading companies within our 
four sectors: process safety, infrastructure safety, medical, 
and environmental & analysis. there was organic constant currency 
revenue decline in the usa, partly due 
to a weaker performance from our fire 
businesses, including firetrace which 
we acquired in october 2015. we have 
continued to strengthen firetrace’s 
management team from within halma 
and we expect its performance to 
improve as we move through 2017. 
we remain confident in its longer-term 
growth potential, especially in 
international markets. this active portfolio 
management has meant the number 
of businesses within halma has 
been relatively stable, reducing 
the potential for concerns over 
management’s increasing span-of-
control as we grow. joining halma offers 
fluxdata the opportunity to access 
new niches and regions for safety, 
health and environmental markets. halma plc
