annual report 
and financial statements 2017 alternative performance measures
this annual report and financial statements provides alternative performance measures (apms) which are not defined or specified  
under the requirements of international financial reporting standards. cautionary statement
the purpose of this report is to provide information to the members of the company. the annual 
report and financial statements contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of the 
group. the forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of the annual report and 
financial statements and the company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements (other than to the extent required by 
legislation and the listing rules and the disclosure and transparency rules of the financial conduct authority). to support this we have included an accounting policy note on apms on page 101, a reconciliation of the 
apms we use where relevant and a glossary on pages 133 to 136 indicating the apms that we use, an explanation of how they are 
calculated and why we use them. international personal finance plc (‘ipf’). as i reported in last year’s annual report, the polish ministry of justice 
published a proposal at the end of 2016 to tighten the existing rate 
cap on consumer loans in poland. as 
previously reported, our home credit business in poland appealed 
decisions received in january 2017 from the polish tax chamber  
with respect to its 2008 and 2009 financial years. jayne almond will step down as non-executive director of ipf with 
effect from the conclusion of our 2018 agm. how did it impact ipf in 2017? q. how are you differentiating the business in a 
highly competitive landscape? q. how would you evaluate performance in 2017? by their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ materially 
from those anticipated. this, together with product 
innovation and our regulatory stakeholder engagement programme, 
supports the work we have undertaken to help protect our business 
model. sustainability and ethics
making a contribution to society is important to us and our 
stakeholder engagement programmes help our businesses play  
a positive role in their communities. the regulatory and competitive landscape is  
likely to remain challenging. our two key channel offerings – home credit and digital – allow us to respond to changing 
consumer behaviour and ensure we provide responsible credit products that our customers want. by offering a broader choice  
of more competitively priced products, including longer-term home 
credit loans and digital credit offerings, we aim to offer better 
customer value and improve credit quality. we now segment our businesses into two 
broad categories, namely 'growth' focused businesses and 'returns' 
focused businesses. our european home credit businesses are in the 
returns category and they are managed to deliver the best possible 
level of customer service and to optimise returns.
