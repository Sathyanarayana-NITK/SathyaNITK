manufacturing sites, our innovation capability and our people, to deliver 
sustainable growth today and in the future. in the united states, we have agreements with a number of pepsi bottlers. sourcing

the raw materials needed to produce 
our range of drinks. each year, we 
spend hundreds of millions of pounds 
on packaging, raw materials and other 
costs to produce our products. we fulﬁ l our purpose through our uniquely broad portfolio of 30 much-loved 
own brands, including iconic brands such as robinsons, miwadi, maguary 
and teisseire, which bring joy to millions of people around the world every day. alongside our own brands, we are proud to produce and sell pepsico brands 
such as pepsi and 7up , which britvic produces in gb and ireland under
