the planned 
expansion of ore mining and processing capacity to 1.3 mtpa  
is ongoing and is now expected to achieve its full capacity in  
the year 2020.
belaya gora –a pre-feasibility study (pfs) was developed for 
belaya gora including plant upgrades and the treatment of ore 
from the nearby blagodatnoye deposit (finalised and released  
in early 2018). mining at belaya gora continued to focus on 
processing low-grade ore stockpiles pending the completion  
of an ongoing project review. baley hub – de-watering programme continued for existing 
taseevskoye open-pit with a view to de-risking the project and 
allowing for further reserve confirmation, with attention now 
turned to finding new water disposal solutions. mnv – to continue extensive near-mine exploration programme 
and publish an updated jorc-compliant reserve estimate in  
q3 2018.
novo – to proceed with construction work on the mine 
expansion and design work on mill expansion. (2016 production: 261,159 oz). average realised price of gold equivalents was us$1,162 per oz 
for the year (2016: us$1,136 per oz). interim dividend of £0.0498 per share paid for h1 2017  
(2016: interim dividend of £0.05 per share). post year end events
second interim dividend of £0.0542 per share approved by  
the board of directors, making a total distribution of £0.104 per 
share for the year to 31 december 2017 (2016: £0.104 per share). novoshirokinskoye (novo) – updated resource and reserve 
estimates for novo supported an increase in gold equivalent 
ounces by more than 70%, but at lower grades. this significant enhancement of our 
reserves, accompanied by a lowering of 
average grade from 8/0 g/t to 3.3 g/t 
reflecting lower cut-off grades and 
increased ore tonnage, underlines the 
strength of our asset base, as does  
a 6.6% increase in our mineral resources 
steady
progress
(measured, indicated and inferred)  
to 17.2 moz of gold and gold equivalent 
compared to 16.1 moz as at 31 december 
2016. further details regarding the 
extension of our resources and reserves 
are to be found in the chief executive’s 
report and the subsequent operational 
review. this performance exceeded our initial 
255,000 – 265,000 oz guidance range 
and our estimate in respect of 2018 
targets looks for a maintained outcome 
of between 265,000 and 275,000 oz. highland gold mining limited | annual report and accounts 2017

strategic report
the combination of a stronger russian 
rouble, and the resulting slightly higher 
dollar production costs, as well as our 
utilisation of low grade ore at belaya  
gora was reflected in a 4.4% reduction  
in ebitda to us$155.3 million in 2017 
compared with us$162.5 million in 2016. 
in line with this, our ebitda margin 
declined to 49.0% (2016: 53.1%). the company’s board of directors adopted a new dividend policy 
targeting a payout of 20% of net cash flow from operations. before i chronicle such progress, i would 
like to draw your attention to the fact  
that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted 
enterprise, some 63% of your company’s 
shares are in ‘free float’ and our shareholder 
base includes a wide range of uk, 
european and us institutional investors. our commitment to good corporate 
governance remains strong. furthermore, 
we continue to enjoy a strong dividend 
record and a conservative debt profile. this compares 
with one fatality and 13 incidents in 2016. 
the scale of increase is, in part, due to 
more stringent reporting requirements  
in relation to minor incidents. meanwhile, 
the strength of the russian rouble, 
influenced by rising oil prices, impacted 
negatively on financial indicators and 
exerted upward pressure on costs. these risks and 
uncertainties could cause actual results 
to differ materially from expected or 
historical results. the risk 
register and framework utilises the 
group’s risk matrix and universal risk 
prioritisation and rating scale, which 
grade and prioritise perceived and 
known risks based on the probability  
of the adverse event occurring and scale 
of consequences from a risk occurrence. *** net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalent, decreased by interest-bearing loans and borrowings and by liability under finance lease. the key aspects of the policy are as 
follows: 
• the company aims to pay a dividend 
that takes into account its cash 
generation, profitability, balance  
sheet strength and capital investment 
requirements;
• the company anticipates that the total 
dividend distribution for each financial 
year will be 20% of net cash flow from 
operating activities; and
• the board may recommend the 
distribution of additional cash on the 
balance sheet through increased or 
special dividends should such funds 
not be required for capital expenditure 
or debt repayment. 1. in the consolidated financial statements, 
capital costs for blagodatnoye are reported 
together with mnv. a modest decrease of 0.4% in novo  
sales was related to the reserving of a 
consignment of zinc concentrate under  
a new export agreement. it has strong management 
and operational teams with 
local and international 
expertise, and an exciting 
portfolio of jorc 
audited resources. on the zif-1  
tailings licence, the board approved funding for design work  
on a possible heap leach operation. with a firm commitment towards safety, health 
and the environment, and social responsibility 
towards employees and communities. i utilise 
this phrase again because there can be 
few better descriptions of management’s 
primary objective which was furthered, 
throughout the year under review,  
by effective business strategies and 
carefully monitored disciplines. management’s efforts to maximise 
operating efficiencies and reduce costs 
across the board led to a decrease in 
consumption, lower expenses for repairs, 
and reduced maintenance costs for 
infrastructure and sites. the main challenge  
is to manage them effectively. the group constantly monitors price trends 
and forecasts, maintains a cost-cutting 
programme, checks the viability of exploration 
and development projects based on the 
current and projected price levels and,  
if necessary, revises specific investment  
plans and schedules. the group places cash in reputable and highly 
rated financial institutions and constantly 
monitors the financial/economic situation. highland

equivalent, above the guidance range for the year of  
255,000 – 265,000 oz. mnogovershinnoye (mnv) – new jorc-compliant reserve 
estimate at mnv doubled ore reserves and supported the 
extension of life-of-mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial 
results from the ongoing near-mine exploration programme 
indicating resources for additional years of operation. new 
exploration licences were received for two areas adjacent to mnv. total cash costs increased by 11.7% to us$507 per oz, 
influenced by the stronger rouble, while all-in sustaining  
cash costs inched up by 1.8% to us$664 per oz. cash inflow from operating activities decreased by 6.0%  
to us$131.0 million (2016: us$139.3 million)
net debt to ebitda ratio slightly increased to 1.28 as  
of 31 december 2017 from 1.26 a year earlier. ** 2016 net cash inflow from operations was amended for us$3.1 million reclassified to the investing activities. total 
cash costs amounted to us$507 per oz
