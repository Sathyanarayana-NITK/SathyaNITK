acinetobacter baumannii 
infections have become 
increasingly difficult to treat 
because of the emergence of 
strains that are resistant to 
all drugs. between its incorporation and 2003, 
the company worked in three main areas of research:
• novel surfaces to improve hip implantation;
• surface bound photodynamic agents; and
• antimicrobial photodynamic agents. source: filice ga, nyman ja, lexau c et al., excess

05 infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains of 
bacteria continue to rise at an alarming rate and 
are of serious concern to the who. there is clearly a global need 
for new anti-infective drugs that are 
effective and reduce the growing 
danger of antimicrobial resistance 
(“amr”). there is now 
a global imperative to put in place 
initiatives at all levels of society 
(including stewardship, new drug r&d, 
diagnostics in both human and animal 
health) to address antibiotic resistant 
bacteria in a concerted effort to 
counter the prediction of ten million 
deaths (and an estimated $100 trillion 
cost by 2050). this was set out in lord 
o’neill’s independent review on 
antimicrobial resistance (“amr”), 
published in may 2016.
in september 2016, the united nations 
announced a recognition of the threat 
from amr, and the un, who, the us 
food and agriculture organization, 
the world organisation for animal 
health and organisation for economic 
co-operation and development are all 
planning to recommend actions to 
address this global problem, which will 
be delivered at the 73rd un general 
assembly in 2018.
the hangzhou g20 leaders’ 
communiqué, published on 20 may 
2017, recognised the importance of 
reactivating the r&d pipeline through 
incentive mechanisms that avoid 
reliance on high price/volume 
combinations, and called on the who, 
fao, oie and oecd to collectively 
report back in 2017.
the us centers for disease control 
and prevention confirm that each year 
in the us at least two million people 
become infected with bacteria that are 
resistant to antibiotics and at least 
23,000 die each year as a direct result 
of such infections. indeed, this was the case with 
penicillin, one of the first antibiotics 
developed almost 100 years ago. we are dedicated to the discovery, development and 
commercialisation of new anti-infectives to improve outcomes  
for patients and provide more effective medical care. the successful listing in 
september 2017 was clearly a major 
achievement and the concurrent 
fundraising of over £15 million means 
that destiny pharma is now very well 
placed to continue to develop much 
needed novel, anti-infective drugs such 
as its lead asset xf-73 and also to 
progress the earlier pipeline. destiny pharma is now well placed to 
continue the clinical development of 
its lead asset into phase 2 studies and 
will also look at opportunities to 
collaborate and develop its earlier 
assets. destiny pharma is committed 
to continue working to address this 
significant market need. if not tackled, rising amr could 
have a devastating impact

by 2050, the death toll could be a

seconds if amr is not tackled now. unless action is taken the o’neill 
report estimates amr will cost the world 
an additional ten million lives a year by 
2050, more than the number of people 
currently dying from cancer each year. us president’s 2016 budget,

that destiny pharma plc is now well placed to 
develop its novel drug pipeline. • a joint steering committee will

for the year ended 31 december 2017.
in january 2017, shareholders 
approved a series of corporate 
measures in preparation for the 
planned admission of the company 
to aim. to mitigate the risks the scientific advisory board, 
expert consultants and management will regularly 
review project progress, industry guidelines and 
manage any issues. this is 
the focus for destiny pharma’s lead 
xf-73 programme. g20 declaration, may 2017
recognised the importance of 
reactivating the r&d pipeline through 
incentive mechanisms that avoid the 
reliance on high price/volume 
combinations and the need to 
promote prudent and responsible use 
of antimicrobials. highlights
we are pleased at the opportunity 
to work with destiny pharma, 
co-ordinating and sharing the data 
that we both generate. • cms will be responsible for the 
commercialisation of the drug 
candidates in their territories. these potential new medicines are being developed to address 
the need for new drugs for the prevention and treatment of 
life‑threatening infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria, 
often referred to as superbugs. infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria 
continue to rise at an alarming rate and they pose a major threat 
to public health in the view of the world health organization. unlike antibiotics, xf drugs have 
demonstrated the remarkable quality of not generating 
bacterial resistance. bacteria have been shown to evolve 
to resist the new drugs that modern 
medicine uses to combat them. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus 
aureus (“mrsa”) is one of the most 
prominent superbugs and a major 
cause of hospital-associated infection 
and featured in the who’s ‘most 
dangerous’ list of superbugs published 
in 2017. the who followed us and 
european guidelines in 2016 by 
recommending the screening and 
decolonisation of mrsa and all strains 
of staphylococcus aureus in 
pre-surgical patients undergoing 
high-risk surgeries in a step designed 
to help prevent such infections. the need for new anti-infective drugs
a global imperative
a study in the us in 2010 found that 
infections caused by the superbug 
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus 
aureus (“mrsa”) were more than twice 
as expensive to treat as infections 
caused by the easier-to-treat 
methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus 
aureus (“mssa”). active against all gram-positive 
bacteria tested to date and 
selected gram-negative bacteria
this includes clinically important and 
infection-causing strains, such as:
• staphylococcus aureus; 
• listeria monocytogenes;
• propionibacterium acnes;
• group g streptococcus;
• mycobacterium tuberculosis;
• streptococcus pneumonia;
• bacillus anthracis;
• yersinia pestis;
• acinetobacter baumannii;
• pseudomonas aeruginosa; and
• clostridium difficile. our platform
