see note 2. and... one more thing. how does it work? it’s as simple as that. it features exclusive 
integration with the gatedtalent platform, 
allowing users to search the gatedtalent 
database and send gdpr related privacy 
notices without leaving the product. a heatmap with 
further information on profile data is available 
at www.gatedtalent.com/metrics/. imagine if this database included detailed, private information on those executives – 
including biographical, aspirational and often compensation data. imagine if the database was curated by the executives themselves in a manner 
that made it entirely gdpr friendly. read further within the report...

1 the component elements of recurring revenues are detailed in note 3. overall, despite the evident pressure 
on new licence sales in 2017 and the 
loss for the year of £0.071m, going 
into 2018 the group believes that it is 
now in a stronger position in its core 
markets than in recent years. while it was initially created for in-
house use, david soon realised that 
there was a market for it beyond his 
own firm, and so he created david 
dillistone systems. the dawn of 
the internet meant that it became far 
easier to sell the filefinder system 
internationally, and, as a result, 
dillistone systems grew rapidly. this confidence in the future allows 
us to recommend a final dividend 
of 0.5p and we anticipate reporting 
further positive progress as the year 
progresses.”

the group has accelerated its acquisition 
intangibles amortisation by £0.459m  
taking total amortisation to £0.838m  
(2016: £0.379m). however we propose paying 
a final dividend of 0.5p (2016: 2.8p) subject 
to shareholder approval. 2  adjusted operating profit is statutory operating profit before acquisition costs, related intangible 
amortisation, movements in contingent consideration and other one-off costs. 3.  adjusted basic eps is computed from statutory profits after tax adjusted to exclude the post-tax 
effect of acquisition costs, related intangible amortisation, movements in contingent consideration 
and other one-off costs. see note 10.

commenting on the results and 
prospects, mike love, non-executive 
chairman, said:
“the current trading performance of 
the group is positive with orders for 
both dillistone systems and voyager 
software ahead of the same period 
in 2017 – with the former more than 
25% up on the same period in 2017 
and the latter having one of the best 
quarters for new business orders in  
its history. recurring revenues for 2017 were at 
record levels and, despite the ongoing 
investment in product development, 
cash reserves have held up well. the product benefits from 
exclusive integration with the filefinder 
anywhere crm, developed by the dillistone 
systems division. alongside voyager software’s vdq 
product, for pure fast paced temporary 
agencies, and mid-office, the pay-and-bill 
solution for the back office, the business covers 
the whole contingency recruitment space. voyager software division products 
voyager front office:
voyager infinity manages the 
work of recruiters working 
to fill permanent and longer-term contract/ 
temporary vacancies delivering measurable 
performance efficiencies and audit trails. is designed for 
fast-paced blue and white collar 
temporary placement agencies 
that have to quickly assemble transient or 
ad hoc teams to serve highly volatile and urgent 
labour requirements. we are seeing significant variances in invitation 
conversion rates between clients. financial risk management
the group’s operations expose it to a number 
of risks that include the effect of changes in 
interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange 
rates and liquidity. further details in relation 
to these risks are shown in note 25. 
interest rate risk
the group is exposed to interest rate risk 
through its floating rate overdraft, and through 
its management of retained cash. the group 
monitors its exposure to interest rate risk when 
borrowing and investing its cash resources. annual report
