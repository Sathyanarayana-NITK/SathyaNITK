holiday memories since 1841.
we share customer reviews 
before you book to help you

technology
technology underpins all of our 
processes and is key to how 
we create value; from our it, 
our customer digital channels 
or our airline efficiency. this includes developing our 
websites to offer a better online experience, as well as maintaining 
a network of profitable stores to attract, inspire and engage our 
customers. this approach means we can focus 
on creating maximum value in the holidays 
to our directly-contracted own-brand 
and selected partner hotels. **  the term ‘underlying’ refers to trading results that are adjusted for separately 
disclosed items that are significant in understanding the ongoing results of the group. separately disclosed items are included on the face of the income statement and are 
detailed in note 7 to the group financial statements. this applies to all references 
of ‘underlying’ in this report. **  the term ‘underlying’ refers to trading results 
that are adjusted for separately disclosed items 
that are significant in understanding the ongoing 
results of the group. strategic partnerships
we will enter into strategic partnerships 
where we have the opportunity to 
streamline our business while also tapping 
into new markets or widening our offer 
to customers. our strategic partnerships 
also enable us to leverage the trust and 
heritage of the thomas cook brand. our partner airlines 
we partner with other airlines to maximise 
the choice for our customers, increase 
flexibility in our operations, and manage 
our fleet more effectively. our complementary 
hotel partnerships
partnerships with expedia and webjet 
to outsource the production of our 
complementary hotel offering allow us 
to provide our customers with a broad 
choice of hotels at the lowest possible 
cost. we focus our holiday offering on our own-
brand hotels and resorts, supplemented by 
a defined portfolio of selected partner hotels. the sale of 
seat-only airline tickets maximises revenue 
from the assets that we control. this represented a bold 
move when we introduced it for summer 
2016, one which is now paying off with 
customer satisfaction on average 12 points 
higher in those hotels with the 24-hour 
hotel satisfaction promise than the rest 
of the portfolio. own-brand hotels and 
resorts and selected 
partner hotels
of course, the other area where we can 
genuinely differentiate ourselves is in the 
holidays we offer and, most importantly, our 
ability to provide customers with holidays 
that are unique to thomas cook. despite the competitive backdrop, the group delivered 
an £28 million increase in underlying operating profit 
to £330 million, an eight per cent increase year-on-year, 
and net profit of £12 million, the third consecutive year 
of positive net profit after tax. debt was reduced 
by another £89 million in the year, and the business 
has signed new financing arrangements amounting 
to £975 million. reflecting the board’s support for the progress that 
has been made in the last year and its confidence in 
the strategy, the board has recommended that we pay 
a dividend to shareholders of 0.6 pence per share. strong customer demand 
for our improved holiday offering helped 
increase revenues by 9 per cent in the year. we’re atol protected  
for peace of mind. these promises shape 
everything we do as a business and determine 
the values against which the performance of all of 
our 22,000 colleagues is measured. see more on page 35
environmental resources
how we manage our operations 
and its use of environmental 
resources is important to both 
our financial success and our 
impact on the environment. in what remains a highly competitive 
environment – one that has contributed to the collapse 
of a number of competitors in the last 12 months – 
management’s focus on executing its strategy for 
profitable growth has delivered good results for the year, 
and set the business on a clear path for sustainable 
growth in the years to come.
