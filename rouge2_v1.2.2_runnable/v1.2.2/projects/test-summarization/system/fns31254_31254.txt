over 15+ years. how have the 
first few months worked out with 
touchstone? founded in 2009, parkwalk is the largest eis growth 
fund manager focused on university spin-outs, 
having raised over £175m to date with the majority 
of funds coming from leading private wealth 
platforms and having backed over 80 companies 
across its managed funds since inception. parkwalk, which 
recorded a net contribution of £1.6m for the period 
since acquisition, has significant assets under

support along the journey from “cradle to maturity”. our portfolio, which

known as ‘imperial innovations’. we are pioneering in our approach, including the 
concept of forming long-term partnerships with leading research universities, passionate about what 
we do, principled in how we work and committed to delivering results for all of our stakeholders. we have a strong track record of 
success and are proud to have helped create and build some truly exciting businesses based on
