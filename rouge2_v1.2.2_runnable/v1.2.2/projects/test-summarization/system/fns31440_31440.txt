registered in england and wales no. 2018 also promises to be an exciting  
year for vitec. the production solutions division will relocate 
its bury st. edmunds operation into a new 
purpose-built manufacturing site nearby in  
h1 2018, demonstrating our confidence  
in the division. during the year, we streamlined our portfolio by 
disposing of the non-core businesses – haigh-farr 
and bexel, our us services business, for net 
consideration of £33.2 million. market position 
vitec has leading premier brands in camera supports, heads, led lights, filters and 
bags for the professional and enthusiast photographer and videographer. we also celebrated the 100-year anniversary of 
our gitzo brand. the integration of the joby and lowepro brands  
is going well. “we have admired vitec’s vision 
and breadth of expertise for some 
time, and are extremely excited to 
be joining the group alongside 
industry leaders such as teradek 
and smallhd. vitec 
delivered a good set of financial results for 
2017, with underlying sales and profit growth, 
and a record level of revenue and profit 
before tax. this streamlining of vitec’s business portfolio 
will in the future deliver enhanced financial 
performance and higher margins for the 
company and we will continue to explore 
bolt-on investment opportunities in our  
core and adjacent markets. the company has a strong executive 
management team to deliver our strategic 
growth plans. technology and 
social media continue to drive fundamental 
changes to this market. the company’s share price rose 
from £6.48 at the start of january 2017  
to £11.30 on 31 december 2017.
as a consequence, the board recommends  
a final dividend of 20.1 pence per ordinary 
share (2016: 17.3 pence) which, subject to 
approval by shareholders at the 2018 agm, 
will be paid on friday 18 may 2018. 
in 2017, we streamlined our portfolio of 
businesses, successfully selling the non-core 
businesses of haigh-farr and bexel, our  
us services business, for a combined net 
consideration of £33.2 million. john mcdonough cbe

2017 was another successful year  
for vitec, with a good trading performance, 
continued underlying growth and significant 
progress on strategic objectives. we are making excellent 
progress with the integration of joby and 
lowepro into the imaging solutions division, 
and creative solutions now has critical mass, 
growth potential and the talent to stand on  
its own as a separate division. in 2017, the board conducted an external 
evaluation of its performance and i am 
pleased to report that the performance of 
your board and its committees were rated 
highly with the right balance of skills and tone 
from the top, along with the experience to 
meet the challenges of growing the business. in 2017, we invested 
significantly in our facilities. the 320,000 ft
2
 site was 
established in 1986 and employs around  
400 people. vitec is the largest manufacturer 
of branded supports in the world, with over 
three million units produced annually. vitec has invested 
significantly in the new, 66,000 ft

which will house around 180 people across 
manufacturing, engineering, operations and 
other functions, and produces approximately 
20,000 units annually.
