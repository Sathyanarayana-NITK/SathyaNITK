02 energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 energean oil & gas plc annual report 2017 03 chairman’s statement
embarking on an exciting  
chapter in our history
dear shareholder,
i was delighted to join the board of energean as chairman in 
july 2017. since then, i have been impressed by how much the 
company has achieved in a few months in running the day-to-day 
business, making significant progress on both the karish and 
tanin project and the prinos basin expansion, and, most recently, 
becoming a premium listed company on the london stock 
exchange (‘lse’) in march 2018, the first significant european oil 
and gas e&p listing since 2014 and the largest ever primary raise 
for a premium-listed e&p company on the lse. since 2008, we have steadily expanded our operating footprint 
from one country to four; from two licences in greece to 
13 licences in the eastern mediterranean; and from 2 mmboe (2p) 
reserves in our prinos licence to 51 mmboe (2p) reserves and 
339 mmboe (2c) resources across our portfolio. the well is currently 
producing approximately 1,000bpd on a 41% choke 
 x production averaged 3,673 bopd in q1 2018, an increase of 31.6% 
year-on-year (q1 2017: 2,790 bopd) and 7.9% quarter-on-quarter  
(q4 2017: 3,405 bopd)
 x progressed plans for a secondary listing on the tel aviv stock 
exchange in israel, on which the group will be filing an application 
in the near future

successful ipo and project financing
energean’s premium listing on the london stock exchange 
in march 2018, raising us$460 million, was a landmark 
accomplishment for the company. energean is committed to realising the significant 
growth potential of its development and exploration projects, 
such as the karish and tanin fields, offshore israel, and other 
licence blocks in greece and montenegro. where we operate
energean currently holds 13 licences across the eastern 
mediterranean, with a balanced mix of producing, development 
and exploration assets, creating near and long-term value. energean’s management team has over 200 years’ combined 
experience in the oil and gas industry encompassing a broad 
range of projects, asset types (including offshore, shallow and 
deepwater), and exploration and production technology. dividendpolicy
we are in a growth phase and our investors have bought into 
an ambitious, fast-moving company in an exciting region. we are an independent oil and gas  
e&pcompanyfocusedondeveloping
resources in the eastern mediterranean, 
wherewehold13licencesandoperate
assetswithaproductiontrackrecord 
ofmorethan37years. the staff 
of energean are determined to make the company the leading 
independent operator in the eastern mediterranean. while the eastern adriatic remains 
substantially underexplored, western offshore adriatic has 
been a prolific hydrocarbon producing province for over 50 years  
for both oil and gas. our most significant underdeveloped assets 
are the karish and tanin offshore gas fields located in israel, 
that will materially increase the scale of the group’s operations  
with gas targeted for 2021.
we have a focused exploration strategy with several 
exploration prospects in greece, montenegro and israel. these achievements are driven by a strong corporate culture 
and an equally strong health, safety and environmental (‘hse’) 
focus, backed by a professional management team. our board and management are focused on this goal and are 
committed to achieving it while delivering value for shareholders 
and stakeholders. ourboardandgovernance
our board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public 
company, energean demonstrates best practice governance 
standards and provides sound stewardship. we are fortunate to have deep sector, financial, hse and 
capital markets expertise on the board to guide the company 
going forward. ten years later, the group has built up a balanced portfolio 
of producing and development assets, containing a total of 
51 mmbbls of oil 2p reserves in greece; 1.2 tcf of natural gas 
2c resources in israel; and 39.4 mmbbls of oil 2c resources in 
both countries. energean’s long track record in the prinos basin, operatorship 
of the majority of our assets, and low operating costs per barrel, 
underpins our ability to maximise cash flow from our reserves 
and resources. prinosdevelopmentprogramme
in the prinos basin, we are delivering an investment plan of 
approximately us$350 million through 2021, which we expect to 
significantly increase production over the next few years, tapping 
the 39.5 mmbbls of discovered 2p oil reserves and 6 bcf of 2p 
gas in the prinos, prinos north and epsilon oil fields. 2

our most significant undeveloped assets are the karish and tanin 
gas fields located offshore israel, which we acquired in december 
2016 for us$148.5 million and which are set to transform our 
business over the next few years. thefuture
we have a clear and substantially de-risked pathway to 
production growth ahead of us with the karish and tanin, 
prinos basin and katakolo development programmes. simonheale

a new era...
when energean was established in 2007, it was with a clear 
vision to build the leading independent e&p company in the 
eastern mediterranean. delivering the project on time and on budget has been affirmed 
through an engineering, procurement, construction, installation 
& commissioning (epcic) turnkey contract, signed with 
technipfmc, protecting our shareholders against risks of delays 
and cost overruns. post-period developments

period,wehavedeliveredonthesekey
strategicmilestones:
 x proceeded with final investment decision (‘fid’) on the karish 
and tanin project on schedule
 x signed the us$1.275 billion senior credit facility for the karish 
and tanin project
 x completed the successful premium listing on the london stock 
exchange, raising us$460 million through the global offer – the 
first significant european oil and gas e&p listing since 2014 and the 
largest ever primary raise for a premium-listed e&p company on the 
london stock exchange
 x signed a us$180 million rbl facility with the european bank for 
reconstruction and development (‘ebrd’) and other international 
institutions to fund the development programme for the prinos, 
prinos north and epsilon oil fields
 x completed the subscription of additional shares in energean israel in 
march 2018 for the amount of us$266.7 million resulting in the group 
increasing its holding in energean israel to 70% 
 x awarded technipfmc an integrated engineering, procurement, 
construction and installation contract for the karish full field 
development, covering the design and installation of the complete 
subsea system, floating production storage and offloading unit 
(fpso), designed to allow the subsequent tie back of tanin field, 
the pipeline system, and the onshore pipeline and valve station at 
the receiving station
 x appointed stena drilling to commence a three development 
well drilling programme in 2019
 x signed extension to the bp offtake agreement from july 2021 
to november 2025 
 x successfully completed the c4km extended reach well in prinos 
north field ahead of schedule in late march. we 
therefore do not anticipate that the company will pay a dividend 
until the karish and tanin development is completed. our portfolio offers both near-term value delivery, significant 
mid-term value and longer-term potential upside from which 
we are well-positioned to benefit. simonheale
chairman
our portfolio offers both  
near-term value delivery, 
significant mid-term value  
and longer-term potential 
upside from which we are 
well-positioned to benefit. this uplift in value has been realised in the space  
of 15 months, due to energean’s ability to execute key project 
milestones quickly and effectively. we 
are entering a new stage in our 
development towards becoming 
the leading independent oil and  
gas e&p company in the eastern 
mediterranean. our long-term strategy is to create 
sustainable growth by leveraging  
the group’s experience and expertise 
in identifying, acquiring, developing 
and operating oil and gas assets  
in this region, and by meeting the 
economic, social and environmental 
challenges of what is a fast-growing 
energy market. we saw a region which had been 
overlooked and under-exploited by the international oil and gas 
majors, and one that would inevitably need more gas 
development to cater for growing demand for cleaner energy 
in the surrounding states. we are embarking on a new era for the company and for the 
emerging oil and gas industry in the eastern mediterranean – 
a region which could soon become a globally significant gas hub. the prinos basin licence was 
acquired in 2007 for us$1.5 million (plus acquired indebtedness). the annual production rate is estimated at 
approximately 4.2 bcm per year on an acq basis (up to 5.1 bcm 
per year including the or gas supply agreement). landmark deals in the region include tamar petroleum’s 
purchase of a 7.5% stake in the tamar natural gas reserve  
in january 2018, for us$560 million and 38.5 million shares. two zohr field deals were concluded in q4 2016, with rosneft 
acquiring a 30% share in the field for us$1.125 billion and bp 
securing a 10% interest in the shorouk concession, offshore 
egypt, which contains the zohr gas field, for us$375 million. a new era...
energean oil & gas plc  
annual report 2017 a new era...
...in our  
gr o wt h s tory
2018 is set to be a very exciting 
chapter in our growth story. in march this year, 
we completed a successful  
ipo raising us$460 million for 
investment in our business, 
principally our karish and 
t anin fields, offshore israel. in a very short 
period, we have taken the prospective karish and tanin gas fields, 
offshore israel, from acquisition in december 2016, through 
a field development plan (fdp) and financing, to a final 
investment decision (fid). signing the us$1.275 billion facility agreement in the same 
month was a key milestone in financing the development of 
the karish and tanin project and testament to the confidence 
placed in us by leading international banks.
