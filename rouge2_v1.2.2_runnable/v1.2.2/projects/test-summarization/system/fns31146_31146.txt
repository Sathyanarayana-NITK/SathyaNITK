*  the group uses alternative performance measures (‘apms’) which are non-ifrs measures to monitor the performance of its operations  
and of the group as a whole. these apms along with their definitions and reconciliations to ifrs measures are provided in the apms section  
on pages 176 to 179. 
certain statements made in this annual report are forward-looking. we employ 
approximately 16,000

source: greencore data. we made our largest 
acquisition ever in the us and have step-
changed our uk business through organic 
growth. the key highlight of the year was the 
completion of the acquisition of peacock 
foods on 30 december 2016. the acquisition 
transforms our market and channel position  
in the us and has given us a growth platform 
of real scale. these forward-looking statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as ‘will’, ‘anticipates’, ‘should’, 
‘expects’, ‘is expected to’, ‘estimates’, ‘believes’, ‘intends’ or similar expressions. *    the group uses alternative performance measures 
(‘apms’) which are non-ifrs measures to monitor the 
performance of its operations and of the group as a 
whole. this related to our decision not to proceed 
with the planned rollout of a common enterprise 
resource planning (‘erp’) platform across the 
uk business. one of the board’s top priorities was to absorb 
the lessons from the large number of votes 
against two remuneration-based resolutions 
at the annual general meeting in january 2017 . we have co-opted 
tom sampson, previously ceo of peacock 
foods and kevin o’malley, recently retired us 
ambassador to ireland, to the board. tom will also chair the group’s us 
advisory council. as part of our ongoing planned board 
development eric nicoli, who was appointed 
as non-executive director in may 2010 will 
retire after the december board meeting. in addition 
to being the senior independent director, eric 
was a member of the nomination committee 
and previously chaired the remuneration 
committee. these represent expectations for the group’s business, and involve risks and uncertainties. the group has based these forward-looking 
statements on current expectations and projections about future events. by their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future and reflect the group’s current 
expectations and assumptions as to such future events and circumstances that may not prove accurate. a number of material factors could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from  
those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. it is who we are! dear shareholder,
fy17 has been both a challenging and 
rewarding year. strategic development
in fy17 we made further progress in  
achieving our vision to become a fast-growing, 
international convenience food leader. this 
vision and our strategy shape the direction  
of the group. this will be a theme 
for the business in fy18 and beyond. there were some challenges in 
delivering a programme of such complexity, 
with an impact on operating leverage in the 
period and with considerable investment  
and restructuring charges incurred. integration is on track and the focus is on 
exploiting the potential of the commercial 
pipeline of outsourcing and innovation-led 
opportunities. finally, we have begun 
a process of streamlining our uk organisation 
which will help underpin overall performance  
in the medium term. corporate governance
in line with the above developments in  
fy17 , we continued to develop our corporate 
governance practices. employees across the uk,

overview
greencore holds strong market positions in both the uk and the us. reported revenue in the year was £2,319.7m, 
an increase of 56.5% versus fy16, and 
adjusted operating profit grew by 37.4%  
to £140.1m, both primarily driven by the 
acquisition of peacock foods. adjusted 
operating margin was 6.0%, 90 basis points 
below the prior year, primarily due to the 
impact of the acquisition of peacock foods 
and the significant commercial investments  
in the uk. adjusted eps declined by 3.8%  
to 15.4p reflecting the increase in adjusted 
operating profit, offset by a higher tax rate,  
a higher finance charge and the impact of an 
increased number of shares as a result of the 
rights issue which part funded the peacock 
foods acquisition.
