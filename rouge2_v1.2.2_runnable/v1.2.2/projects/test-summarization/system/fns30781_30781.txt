attack is a cyber-threat, in which 
multiple computer systems 
attack a target, such as a server, 
website or other network asset, 
and cause a denial of service for 
users of the targeted resource. the flood of incoming messages, 
connection requests or 
malformed packets to the target 
system, forces it to slow down or 
shut down, thereby denying 
service to legitimate users or 
systems. ddos attacks are a 
threat to service availability, 
network security, brand 
reputation and ultimately lead to 
lost revenues. attackers are continuing to 
leverage ddos attacks as part of 
their cyber-threat arsenal to 
either disrupt business 
operations or provide a 
smokescreen while they access 
sensitive corporate information, 
and they are doing it in 
increasingly creative ways that 
circumvent traditional security 
solutions or reduce the previous 
effectiveness of ddos scrubbing 
centres. corero’s key operational centres are in 
marlborough, massachusetts in the usa 
and edinburgh in the uk, with the 
company’s registered office in uxbridge 
in the uk. the science behind this 
tool is consistent with that promoted by 
bain consulting’s net promoter score® 
(“nps”). richard  
is a fellow of the institute of chartered 
accountants in england and wales

development in the uk. corero network security plc annual report and accounts 2017 what is a ddos attack? • availability and security of internet services and applications is essential  
for digital / online businesses 
• downtime or compromise equates to:
• lost revenues and additional operational costs
• unhappy customers with increased costs for retention of existing  
customers and acquisition of new customers
• brand and reputation damage 
• legal liability and fines

corero revenue for the year ended 31 
december 2017 was $8.5 million (2016: 
$8.8 million) with smartwall revenue up 
43% over the prior year whilst legacy 
product revenues declined as expected. smartwall recurring revenue increased 
to $3.4 million (2016: $1.5 million). the 
ebitda loss reduced to $5.1 million  
(2016: ebitda loss $6.4 million). the head of the national cyber security 
centre (“ncsc”), ciaran martin, recently 
commented that while the uk is fortunate 
to have avoided a so-called category one 
cyber-attack so far, it is only a matter of 
time before a catastrophic cyber-attack is 
launched on its critical infrastructure or 
election setup. a recent report from neustar revealed 
that many businesses viewed unsecured 
internet of things (“iot”) devices as a 
major concern. but it’s not just a password problem 
anymore. in an ideal 
world, all devices should be forced to 
go through some sort of network 
configuration before being used, 
rather than being exploitable from a 
default position. 49%

annual report & accounts 2017 04 what we do how we do it
our proposition
corero provides dedicated technology for 
real-time mitigation of ddos attacks in 
seconds versus minutes, allowing good user 
traffic to flow uninterrupted. jens is chairman of the corero 
remuneration committee. richard is chairman of the  
corero audit committee. * andrew lloyd was appointed an executive 
director on 3 january 2017. he was 
previously a non-executive director 
(appointed 19 november 2012). board changes
the notice of agm will include a resolution 
to reappoint jens montanana and andrew 
miller who retire by rotation in accordance 
with the company’s articles of association. these services, delivered by 
the corero security operations centre, are customised to 
meet the security policy requirements and business goals 
of each smartwall customer that engages in a 
securewatch service plan. government regulations
corero welcomes the investment and 
attention that governments are 
committing to the cyber-security of 
critical national infrastructure (“cni”), 
particularly recent guidance from the us 
government which sets out detailed 
recommendations on how to boost 
resilience and ensure suitable 
protections and mitigation systems are 
deployed. corero recently submitted a 
response to the joint committee on the 
national security strategy’s inquiry 
‘cyber security: uk national security in a 
digital world’ and recommended the 
following actions are taken:
chief executive’s strategic update
corero is well positioned to deliver on its goal  
of being the leading player in the real-time 
ddos mitigation market with smartwall 
solution validation from over 90 customers. • ddos attacks on cni, particularly 
frequent low-volume and short 
duration attacks, must be a priority 
area for government;
• government must take advantage of 
opportunities, such as that provided by 
the implementation of the nis 
directive, to fulfil its ambition of 
becoming ‘the safest place in the  
world to live and work online’;
• the implementation of the directive 
on security of network and 
information systems (“nis directive”) 
should not be treated as a tick box 
exercise but instead should be grasped 
as an opportunity for the uk to lead 
the world in the strength of its 
cyber-security regulatory framework;
• government should look at 
international best practice and adopt a 
more attack-specific and specialist-led 
approach towards cyber-security, 
moving away from generic wide-
ranging statements;
• government must set out and 
rigorously enforce detailed cyber-
security requirements for operators  
of critical national infrastructure; and
• government should clarify 
departmental cyber-security 
responsibilities and allocate further 
resource to the ncsc.
