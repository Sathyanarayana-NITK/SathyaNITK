the implementation of our group strategy 
is overseen by the board of directors, which 
maintains the high standards of governance 
our shareholders expect. i am pleased that tim collier joined as the 
group chief financial officer during the year. during the year

non-executive director. sadly, following a short illness, nicholas 
berry, non-executive director, died in 
december 2016. nicholas had served on 
the dmgt board for nine years, providing 
invaluable advice and insights across 
a wide range of areas, particularly our 
leadership programmes. †  statutory revenue, operating profit and profit before tax figures are for continuing operations only

strategic report
governance financial statements shareholder information strategic report this has also given euromoney the financial 
flexibility to pursue its own strategy. in addition, an unparalleled 
cross-media advertising proposition in 
print and digital formats across the mail 
and metro titles has benefited performance. in our b2b businesses, the requirement to 
have fully integrated data analytic solutions 
has become an increasing priority across all 
industries and our operations are already at 
the forefront of this trend. our education technology (edtech) 
business, hobsons, is bringing predictive 
analytics and improvements to the customer 
experience across its naviance, starfish and 
intersect platforms. our european property 
information businesses are using their 
modelling expertise with large data sets 
to launch new products which will enable 
faster decision-making in the insurance and 
banking sectors. dmgt manages a diverse, multinational portfolio of companies, 
with total revenues of around £1.5 billion, that provide 
businesses and consumers with compelling information, 
analysis, insight, events, news and entertainment. that said, 
this year’s financial performance has 
been affected by challenging market 
conditions and the continued volatility 
in the wider media industry, however, 
dmgt has benefited from the resilience 
provided by its diversified portfolio. your group has also continued to invest 
to take advantage of the trends in both 
b2b and consumer digital markets. we saw encouraging signs of growth from 
investments in several initiatives designed 
to deliver long-term organic returns, albeit 
with reduced expectations for some b2b 
businesses that are facing particularly 
challenging market conditions and which 
resulted in impairments that adversely 
affected our statutory results. t o turn this  
off, e.g. this has been a year 
of transformation as we have made 
significant changes across the group. in consumer media, dmg media’s 
performance demonstrated that it is 
possible for a modern news media company 
to prosper in a digital world. providing quality, popular 
journalism has resulted in circulation 
outperformance. consumer

chairman’s statement
i am pleased to present the annual 
report for 2017, a year in which dmgt 
demonstrated once again the benefits 
of maintaining a strong portfolio of 
businesses that have the potential to 
deliver attractive long-term returns for 
our shareholders. a major milestone 
was reached this year with the launch of 
risk modeler on the rms(one) platform, 
dmgt’s first truly enterprise class solution. the fy 2016 statutory results have been reclassified accordingly. ω  pro forma fy 2016 figures have been restated to treat euromoney as a c.67% owned subsidiary during 
the first three months and as a c.49% owned associate during the nine months to september 2016, 
consistent with the ownership profile during fy 2017. see reconciliation on page 28. dmgt is also 
a founding investor and the largest shareholder of euromoney 
institutional investor plc and zpg plc. during the year, 
dmgt unlocked significant value by reducing 
its holding in euromoney institutional 
investor plc (euromoney) to around 49%. this interactive pdf allows you to find information
