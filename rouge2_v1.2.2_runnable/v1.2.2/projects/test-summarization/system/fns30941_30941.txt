valirx plc annual report and accounts 2017 valirx plc (aim: val), a life science company, which 
focuses on clinical stage cancer therapeutic development, 
taking proprietary & novel technology for precision 
medicines towards commercialisation and partnering. its business model focuses on out-licensing 
drug candidates after early proof-of-principle and 
efficacy trials. our product pipeline
we aim to make a significant contribution in “precision” 
medicine and science, namely to engineer a breakthrough 
into human health and well-being, through the early 
detection of cancer and its therapeutic intervention. valipharma
valipharma is the therapeutics 
division, with two embedded 
technologies primarily directed 
at the treatment of cancers. • val401 and val201 have received several 
major patent grants and the ip portfolio 
now covers all major areas worldwide. development of val301
the company continues with the development of val301, 
which is the proposed reformulation of val201 for a new 
indication, endometriosis. read more on p. 16 to 17 valirx plc annual report and accounts 2017 06

strategic report
valirx was formed in 2006 – here is a brief look at the contribution valirx 
has made to the compounds’ and technology’s development pathways. principal activities
the principal activity of the group continued 
to be that of an oncology therapeutics and 
companion diagnostics development company. the compound selectively halts tumour growth by 
specifically preventing the proliferation of cancerous cells, 
hence tumour growth is suppressed and metastases are 
significantly reduced. the specially designed molecule 
mimics natural mechanisms, with one part of the molecule 
identifying and targeting the rebellious gene and the other 
part silencing it. • the compound has been designed against a 
gene expressing bcl-2 protein, which has been 
implicated and associated with various cancers. hormone therapy using a 
combination of hormone therapies  
such as lhrh agonists and androgen 
receptor antagonists is a prominent 
treatment regime. valiseek
valiseek is a joint venture between 
valirx and tangent reprofiling ltd 
to develop val401 in lung cancer 
and potentially other indications. in parallel, we continued to advance the 
reformulation of val201 into val301 for the 
treatment of endometriosis, a painful and 
debilitating gynaecological condition with high 
unmet clinical needs. ariana has also advocated 
the compound’s therapeutic and palliative 
potential when combined with both traditional 
chemotherapies and immune-oncology 
treatments. 1 3 2
develop the potential and 
commercialise val201,  
the prostate cancer drug 
this drug offers a novel and exciting approach for  
targeted cancer therapy and is currently in a phase i/ii 
clinical trial in subjects with hormone resistant prostate 
cancer. • the progress of our core clinical products, 
val201 and val401 has been substantial 
and both have reached significant value 
inflection points. the current momentum 
and exciting trajectory of both compounds 
offer potential investors an investable 
proposition and an attractive offering

chairman’s statement
in my report for the year ended 
31 december 2016, i informed 
our shareholders that we were 
making important strides in 
growing our internal r&d 
capabilities, such that we remain 
at the forefront of personalised 
and precision medicine. i would like to take this opportunity to express 
my sincere gratitude to all shareholders, fellow 
directors, and every member of the group for 
the trust and support accorded to the board  
in positioning valirx among the frontrunners in 
the fields of personalised and precision medicine. val201 now has five patents families 
in its portfolio, four of which have been fully 
granted and with one allowed. read more on p. 06 to 07
our risk management
valirx is a clinical stage biotechnology company 
and in common with other companies operating 
in this field, is subject to a number of risks and 
uncertainties. the principal risks and uncertainties 
are indicated below. there are patent applications currently pending in many other territories and covering various aspects of the programme. the table below provides details of patents in the val401 portfolio that have been either fully granted or allowed. final laboratory tests 
are underway prior to advancing the val301 compound into 
additional toxicology and then clinical trials;
• patent protection and portfolio coverage was extended for 
val201 and val401 during the period with us patent granted 
for val201 in q1 2018.
financial highlights 
• four placings during the period raising £3.07m to advance  
the clinical trial of val201 and for the pre-clinical progress  
of other programmes;
• marked 36.4% reduction in total comprehensive loss for  
the year to £3.02m (2016: loss £4.75m) reflecting decrease  
in clinical trial expenditure on medicinal products;
• loss per share from continuing operations of 1.90p  
(2016: loss 8.54p);
• cash and cash equivalents as at 31 december 2017 of £701,410  
(2016: £560,763). our financial results show the total 
comprehensive loss for the year ended 31 
december 2017 was £3,019,684, a decrease of 
36.40% on the previous year (2016: £4,748,003) 
and a loss per share from continuing operations 
of 1.90p (2016: loss 8.54p). simultaneously, we raised £1.0m 
of gross proceeds through the issue of 23,529,412 
new ordinary shares at a price of 4.25 pence  
per share for advancing the clinical trial of 
val201 and for the pre-clinical progress of  
other programmes. as at year-end, the group 
had cash and cash equivalents of £701,41  
(2016: £560,763). valirx plc annual report and accounts 2017
welcome t o v alirx plc operational highlights
• period of substantive and encouraging development across 
drug portfolio taking lead compounds to significant value 
inflection points;
• phase l/ll clinical trial of val201 has continued to demonstrate 
high safety and tolerability and has received mhra approval 
to extend and expand the scope of the clinical trial to treat 
prostate cancer;
• completion of val401’s phase ii clinical trial in patients  
with lung cancer - with trial data offering palliative stage 
patients an improvement in symptoms alongside improved 
survival prospects;
• period saw the optimized, commercially viable, 2
nd
 generation 
development of the val101molecule derived from valirx’s 
proprietary geneice platform to shut down rebellious genes 
causing cancer and potentially some neurological disorders – 
preparation is underway for the compound’s entry into the clinic;
• val301 is in late pre-clinical phase initially for the treatment of 
the gynaecological condition, endometriosis – a reformulation 
of val201, which pre-clinical studies suggest does not 
compromise bone density or fertility. • a particularly noteworthy achievement by 
the company in the reporting period was 
the successful completion of the val401 
phase ll clinical study in patients with late 
stage non-small cell lung cancer, the most 
common form of lung cancer. this gives 
the trial increased flexibility and speed for 
reaching therapeutic levels and to reduce 
disease progression. val201 continued 
to demonstrate high safety and tolerability, 
as well as preliminary therapeutic activity 
throughout the clinical study, culminating in 
receiving approval from the uk medicines and 
healthcare products regulatory agency and 
the research ethics committee to substantially 
raise the dosing level in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic prostate cancer in 
order to reach therapeutic levels and reduce 
disease progression. 1

pre-clinical
optimisation
the group operates through the following 
divisional companies: 
it currently has two products in phase i/ii and phase ii 
clinical trials. • the company has also progressed the pre-
clinical pipeline. the programmes currently 
consist of val301, which is derived from the 
formulation of val201 and the compound 
val101, which is derived from our geneice 
technology platform. furthermore, these results came hot on the 
heels of valirx receiving notification that a 
further method-of-treatment patent has been 
granted by the us patent office covering the 
use of val201 in the treatment of prostate 
cancer.
