chairman’s statement
the board remains confident in the prospects for the group
strong strategic 
progress over the year
i am pleased to announce, on behalf of the board of safestore, another 
strong set of results for the year ended 31 october 2017. 
there has been strong strategic progress over the year. shareholders will be asked to approve the dividend at the company’s 
annual general meeting on 21 march 2018 and, if approved, the final 
dividend will be payable on 6 april 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 9 march 2018.
the board remains confident in the prospects for the group and 
will continue its progressive dividend policy in 2018 and beyond. 3  like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of wandsworth, altrincham, birmingham (including closure of our existing birmingham store) and 
emerainville, as well as chiswick and combs-la-ville and the closure of deptford in the current financial year. growth 
in occupancy in the uk regions outside london and the south east 
performed particularly well. 2  like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of wandsworth, altrincham, birmingham (including closure of our existing birmingham store) and 
emerainville, as well as chiswick and combs-la-ville and the closure of deptford in the current financial year. of our 146 stores (including 
alligator), 93 are in london and the south east of england or in paris, with 
53 in the other major uk cities. organically we have developed and 
opened six new stores in the uk and paris, with a pipeline of a further 
four new stores opening in london, birmingham and paris.”
frederic vecchioli, safestore’s chief executive officer
strong strategic progress and a fourth 
consecutive year of double-digit cash tax

note
please see overleaf for accompanying notes. 6 the consideration paid for alligator on 1 november 2017 was £56.0 million, and is subject to customary working capital adjustment. 9  occupancy excludes offices but includes bulk tenancy. the ifrs 2 cost 
is excluded as it is written back to distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated national insurance element). over the last 18 months our market-leading positions in the uk and paris 
have been consolidated, supported by the acquisitions of space maker 
and alligator self storage, which added 24 stores to the uk portfolio and 
boosted earnings from the outset. in addition, the impact of the acquisition of space maker on 29 july 2016 has 
been adjusted. space maker, 
acquired in july 2016, is fully integrated into the group and the six 
new stores opened over the last sixteen months are all performing 
at least in line with their business plans. the acquisition of alligator, 
completed on 1 november 2017, will be integrated during the first half 
of the current financial year and we have a pipeline of four new sites, 
adding 226,000 sq ft of capacity, opening over the next 18 months. 17  129.9

notes
1  cash tax adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment 
properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (excluding shares held by the 
safestore employee benefit trust). 5   profit before tax decreased by £16.0 million to £78.9 million (fy2016: £94.9 million) principally as a result of exceptional costs totalling £17.7 million (fy2016: exceptional income of 
£4.3 million), which includes exceptional refinancing costs of £16.3 million, and a reduction in the gain on investment properties by £2.5 million to £39.2 million (fy2016: £41.7 million), 
offset by an improvement in underlying ebitda of £8.7 million. financial results
revenue for the year was £129.9 million, 12.6% ahead of last year 
(fy2016: £115.4 million) and was up 10.0% on a constant currency 
basis. like-for-like revenue was up 3.3% in constant currency. i remain confident that the business is well 
positioned for growth and to deliver additional value for shareholders. during the year, our remuneration committee has spent a significant 
amount of time engaging with our shareholders around our new 
remuneration policy. i would 
like to take this opportunity to thank all the shareholders who have 
supported our proposals, as well as all of those who have engaged 
with us and put considerable time and effort into analysing and 
providing feedback on our proposals. people
in another year of progress, our people continue to be the key to the 
success of the business. therefore, neither the company’s ability to 
distribute nor pay dividends are impacted (with the exception of the associated national insurance element). the refinancing of our bank debt and us private placement notes in 
may 2017 has improved further the balance sheet flexibility and capacity 
to continue to take advantage of carefully selected development and 
acquisition opportunities. like the remuneration committee, i strongly 
believe that the new remuneration structure, which is designed 
to break away from the conventional model and drive exceptional 
corporate performance from our talented management team over 
the next five years, is in the best interests of all stakeholders. this represents a level 
of gearing we consider appropriate for the business to enable the 
group to increase returns on equity, maintain financial flexibility 
and to achieve our medium term strategic objectives. including alligator, the group has 1.7m sq ft of fully 
invested unlet space available, offering significant operational upside in the 
existing portfolio. our continued focus will be on ensuring that we drive 
occupancy to utilise this capacity at carefully managed rates. typically customers requiring storage 
start their journey by conducting online research using generic keywords 
in their locality (e.g. in a spirit of constant improvement 
our content and delivery process is dynamically enhanced through our 
360-degree feedback process utilising the learnings from not only the 
candidates, but also our training store managers. 2  cer is constant exchange rates (euro-denominated results for the current period have been retranslated at the exchange rate effective for the comparative period in order to present the 
reported results on a more comparable basis). 4  underlying ebitda is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent 
and depreciation. underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying ebitda less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to 
bank loans and cash. 7  ltv ratio is loan-to-value ratio, which is defined as gross debt (excluding finance leases, but adjusted for the fair value of the us dollar cross currency swap) as a proportion of the valuation 
of investment properties and investment properties under construction (excluding finance leases).
