chemical
steam and electricity are widely 
used as an energy source 
in chemical production and 
product processing, while our 
pumps are used to safely and 
accurately transfer and dose 
critical chemical components. electric heating elements 
are used in commercial food 
equipment. oil & gas
electrical heating products 
increase fluid viscosity, deliver 
freeze protection and help 
separate natural gas, crude oil 
and water during extraction. our steam products enable 
optimum steam system 
performance and reduce 
energy use during oil and 
gas production. steam traps, condensate return 
pumps and isolation valves
 − controls: i.e. automatic control 
valves, pressure regulators and 
temperature controls
 − thermal energy management: i.e. metering products, boiler house 
products, heat transfer packages and 
energy services
delivering: 
 − improved process efficiency and 
product quality
 − reduced waste production, co 2 
emissions, energy and water use
 − less maintenance downtime
 − compliance with industry standards 
electrical process heating  
and temperature management 
solutions
uses: 
 − electrical heating for mission-critical 
industrial processes
 − freeze protection for pipes, valves 
and tanks
 − component heating for industrial 
heaters and systems
benefits of electrical solutions: 
 − easy to incorporate, install and maintain
 − high temperatures
 − controllable
 − no emissions at point of use
products: 
 − industrial heaters & systems: 
circulation, immersion, tank and air 
heaters, and control systems
 − heat tracing: heat trace cables, 
controls and sensor systems
 − component technologies: flexible, 
band, nozzle, strip, ring and tubular 
heaters, sensors, and controls
delivering: 
 − efficient thermal energy management 
and control solutions for improved 
industrial processes
niche peristaltic pumps 
and associated fluid path 
technologies
uses:
 − pumping and fluid transfer in difficult 
pumping applications
 − from biotechnology processes 
that demand sterility and precision 
to corrosive slurries in precious 
metal processing 
benefits of peristaltic pumps: 
 − hygienic applications: fluid is 
contained within a tube, a sterile tube 
makes a sterile pump
 − dirty applications: fluid is contained 
within a tube, it does not damage or 
contaminate the pump
 − gentle pumping action
 − low maintenance
 − highly accurate pumping
products: 
 − ten established brands offering: 
pumps, tubing, specialty filling 
systems and single use fluid 
path technologies
delivering: 
 − highly accurate pumping and fluid 
path solutions

introduction
my last full year as chairman was a 
successful and eventful one. in 2017, group sales reached 
£1 billion, the group’ s underlying trading 
margin, excluding acquisitions, exceeded 
24% and the proposed dividend marks the 
50th consecutive year of progress. financial highlights
sales for the year were £998.7 million, an 
organic increase of 6%; exceeding global 
industrial production growth of 3.4%. favourable currency movements increased 
sales on translation by 5% and acquisitions 
added 20%. through our direct sales business 
model we stay close to our customers, understand their 
day-to-day process requirements and apply our technical 
expertise to deliver engineered solutions that increase 
efficiency and add value. we are engineering opportunities. the events of 2017 demonstrate that we 
are not content to let external circumstances 
dictate group performance and outcomes, 
but are actively engaged in engineering 
opportunities for sustainable growth. as a 
consequence of jamie’ s appointment, it 
“ the events of 2017 demonstrate that we are not 
content to let external circumstances dictate 
group performance and outcomes, but are 
actively engaged in engineering opportunities for 
sustainable growth.”

*  unless otherwise stated, all profit measures exclude certain 
items, as set out and explained in the financial review and 
in note 2 on page 129. organic measures are at constant 
currency and exclude acquisitions. †
 organic percentage growth measures are at constant currency and exclude acquisitions. gestra’ s market-leading automated 
boiler controls and strong market position in 
germany increases the market share of our 
steam specialties division, improves access 
to the german market and provides potential 
to grow gestra’ s presence outside its core 
german market. employees
on behalf of the board, i would like to 
welcome our new gestra and chromalox 
colleagues to the group and to thank all our 
employees throughout the world for their 
individual and collective contributions that 
have enabled us to deliver another excellent 
set of results in 2017.
summary and outlook
global industrial production growth rates, 
which are a good indicator of our market 
conditions, strengthened throughout the year 
resulting in growth of 3.4% in 2017 compared 
with 0.9% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015. 
current indications for the industrial 
production growth rate in 2018 suggest 
that it will be at a similar level to that seen in 
2017. we will remain focused on engineering 
opportunities for self-generated growth, 
through the rigorous implementation of our 
strategy. as we integrate and develop the 
recent acquisitions, we are also laying the 
foundations for their future organic growth.
