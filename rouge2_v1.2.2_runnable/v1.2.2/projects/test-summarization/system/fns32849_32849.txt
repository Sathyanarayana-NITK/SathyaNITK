polymetal is a leading precious metals mining 
group operating in russia, kazakhstan and 
armenia. listed on the london and moscow 
stock exchanges, we currently have a 
portfolio of eight producing gold and silver 
mines and an impressive pipeline of future 
growth projects. 1999 
polymetal is founded
polymetal was established by 
the ict group in st petersburg 
with the objective of building 
a highly professional russian 
mining company, using advanced 
technology throughout – from 
exploration to bullion production. 2007 
polymetal listing on the 
london and russian 
stock exchanges
polymetal goes public on the 
london and russian stock 
exchanges, an affirmation of 
its adherence to international 
standards of corporate 
governance and the quality  
of its asset portfolio. 2016 
expanding operations 
for the first time, polymetal 
expands its operations into 
armenia with the acquisition 
of the kapan operating  
mine and processing plant. our exploration programme 
reveals a large pgm deposit 
at viksha. ebrd deal finances 
the completion and delivery 
of kyzyl in 2018. 2008-2011 
formation of the 2nd 
generation of assets 
and expansion into 
kazakhstan  
as result of successful 
greenfield exploration and m&a, 
polymetal added albazino, 
mayskoye, omolon/kubaka 
and varvara to its portfolio 
of high quality assets. during that time, the company has 
delivered a production compound annual growth rate (cagr) 
of 24%, developed 16 mines from scratch, added 6.7 moz of 
gold equivalent and 9.5 moz of palladium equivalent in newly 
discovered resources, paid out more than us$1 billion in 
dividends and attained industry leadership in processing 
refractory gold ore. we have expanded our operations within 
three mining jurisdictions in the former soviet union (russia, 
kazakhstan and armenia) and have maintained a premium 
listing on the london stock exchange since 2011.
playing to our strengths
over the last 20 years, we have built on our core 
competencies: using a hub-based system (dukat, omolon 
and okhotsk); mastering pox technology and trading 
refractory gold concentrates (kyzyl, albazino, mayskoye); 
operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at 
locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations 
in the russian far east). polymetal

dear fellow stakeholders
in 2018, polymetal celebrates its 20th anniversary;  
perhaps still youthful by global metrics but, nevertheless, a 
respectable milestone for a business built from the ground 
up in an emerging market. bobby godsell

looking ahead
operating excellence
consistently delivering a robust  
operating and financial performance helps 
generate positive cash flow and significant 
returns for our shareholders. advancing medium-term growth
kyzyl is due to deliver its first gold in  
q3 2018 and will drive medium-term 
production growth through to 2020.
m&a and exploration
greenfield and brownfield exploration  
have proved to be efficient growth  
sources for the company, along with 
value-accretive acquisitions. 2003 
vitaly nesis is  
appointed as ceo 
a new organisational structure is 
formed to increase efficiency. inaugural dividend
a new dividend policy is 
implemented and special  
dividends introduced. this allowed us to generate positive 
free cash flow and significant cash returns to our shareholders. we do not retain excess cash and 
return free cash flow to shareholders through substantial dividend 
payments while retaining a safe leverage level. market trends and opportunities
our investments in attractively priced high-quality assets enable us to generate a 
consistently sustainable free cash flow and deliver returns for our shareholders. in march 2018, we celebrate 20 years since 
the foundation of polymetal. polymetal is at the start of another dynamic stage in its 
history. our investment in new projects – kyzyl, and 
potentially into nezhda, prognoz and a second amursk pox 
line – is expected to enable polymetal to deliver superior 
shareholder returns and industry leadership over the long 
term. i look forward to making this journey, along with the 
company’s stakeholders. from free cash flow for 2012-2017 totalling us$1.3 
billion, polymetal paid out us$1.0 billion in dividends, providing 
tangible returns to shareholders with a sector-leading three-
year total shareholder return (tsr) of 61%. per year. 2 
on a 100% basis. this enabled us to deliver a net profit for the year of  
us$354 million. reserves at nezhda

progress update
kyzyl amursk pox expansion pox-2 project 
kyzyl is one of the best development-
stage gold projects in the world. consistently focusing on high-grade 
assets has also ensured that we have delivered superior 
returns on capital. we have substantially increased our resources this year. however, this was partially offset by 
the best performance in gold prices since 2010, with 13% 
annual growth. for the sixth consecutive year, we beat our  
production guidance through a consistently robust and resilient 
operating performance. during that time, 
we have consistently delivered a strong 
operating performance and made good on our 
promises to our shareholders, employees, 
communities and other stakeholders. financial prudence pays dividends
adherence to strong capital discipline has been the foundation 
of our strategy – in careful project selection with a preference 
for high grade and low-capital-intensity, in value-accretive 
mergers & acquisitions (m&as), as well as in our dividend 
policy. leading by example
at the same time, polymetal recognises its duty of care for its 
entire stakeholder base, as evidenced by its practice of good 
governance and sustainable development in the regions in 
which we operate. the board and management are fully 
committed to a sustainability agenda with a renewed focus  
on health and safety.
