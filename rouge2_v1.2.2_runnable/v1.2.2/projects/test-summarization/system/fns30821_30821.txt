continue their education and investment 
in themselves, there has been a 35-year 
period of growing student numbers 
throughout the country. most uk universities offer an 
accommodation guarantee for 
first year and international students, 
but even this is a challenge with current 
beds available. some are looking to 
extend it to second and third year and 
all international students. we call this combination home for success. we offer a variety of accommodation at different price points and 
with different payment options enabling students to choose the right 
accommodation for them. we also support the unite foundation, which 
provides accommodation scholarships to young people who have been 
in care or are estranged from their families. many 
universities have responded to this by 
partnering with private accommodation 
providers, most notably through 
nominations agreements under which 
they make up their accommodation 
shortfall by reserving rooms in return 
for a guaranteed rent. the majority of our buildings, for 
example, are arranged in the preferred 
format of clusters of en-suite bedrooms 
with shared kitchens and living areas. all reports and 
presentations are available

all students, helping them grow and succeed 
at university and beyond. quality homes
we use our unique insight and experience to deliver quality, secure 
homes where students can develop academically and socially. going to university is an exciting time, but the big changes moving to 
university brings can be stressful. we design our homes and services to 
ensure the transition from home to university is as smooth as possible. strategic report corporate governance financial statements other information 01

demand for uk higher 
education remains strong
market drivers
student numbers 
continue to outstrip 
accommodation supply. today there 
are more than 1.8 million students 
studying in the uk. uk higher education 
institutions have c.300,000 beds 
available, with a further 280,000 
provided by the private sector. however, data from the universities and 
colleges admission service (ucas) shows 
that applications for 2018 from the eu rose 
by 3.4% and those from international 
students rose by 1 1.1%, to a record level. the interpersonal and self-management skills honed at university provide 
a critical bridge to adulthood. we regularly measure  
how well we are meeting student needs through customer surveys and 
focus groups. read more on
