group finance director and the board retained the 
services of paul rayner on an interim basis while the 
search for a permanent successor was conducted. nick keveth was appointed chief financial officer 
on 1 june 2017. rob rennie stepped down as chief 
executive officer on 15 february 2017 and was 
replaced by paul mcdonald with immediate effect. our internal board evaluation in 2017 robustly 
challenged all aspects of the board including my 
performance and that of each director, the board 
committees and the board as a whole. david evans
