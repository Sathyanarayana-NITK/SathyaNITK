john michael edelson
non-executive chairman
michael brings a wealth of experience as a board director 
to sysgroup plc. he has been a founding director or 
chairman of a number of companies admitted to the aim 
market, including prestbury group plc, knutsford group 
plc, mercury recycling group plc (now ironveld plc) and 
asos plc. he was a non-executive chairman of bramhall 
plc, subsequently renamed magic moments internet plc 
and then host europe plc, which acquired magic moments 
design limited in september 1999. he has also been on 
the board of manchester united football club since 1982.
christopher evans
chief executive officer
chris studied software engineering at liverpool john 
moores university before founding switch media ltd, 
a web hosting provider. he was a founder of q4ex ltd (a company acquired 
by sysgroup). at the same time the group achieved impressive growth in line with market expectations, delivering an increase in group 
revenue of 65.1%, including 19.8% organic growth. this, combined with the subsequent disposal of the company’s legacy, non-core 
sme mass market hosting division, resulted in the formation of a business focused exclusively on servicing the high value 
managed services market, with a strong focus on cloud. the managed services market continues to evolve and remains highly fragmented, and the 
board believes that a strategy of organic growth and targeted acquisitions, supported by the group’s strong gross cash 
position of £3.5m and unutilised £2.5m acquisition facility, will deliver sustained, long-term value for shareholders. these were large undertakings for our business as firstly we acquired a business which had higher revenue and staff 
numbers than ourselves and then disposed of a business which represented almost half of the group’s size, before the 
acquisition of sys-pro. annual report & accounts 2017

chairman’s statement
the board is pleased to report on a busy and successful year for the group, which saw the business undergo a complete 
transformation to a managed services provider, delivering against our stated strategic objectives for the 2017 financial year. the group’s transformation consisted of the acquisition of systems professional limited (“sys-pro”) in early july, 
complementing the group’s existing managed services business, and an associated re-branding of the business from 
daily internet plc to sysgroup plc. to facilitate the funding of the sys-pro, the group completed an oversubscribed placing in july raising £5.0m gross and 
bringing a number of new institutional shareholders onto the company’s register. in conjunction with the placing and 
acquisition, the company also undertook a 40 for 1 share consolidation and sought court approval for the cancellation of 
its share premium account, leaving the parent company able to pay dividends in the future should it be appropriate to do 
so (see note 22). at 
the year-end the fair value of the contingent consideration stood at £0.69m. we mitigate this risk by offering 
competitive reward packages. liquidity risk
the group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to 
invest cash assets safely and profitably. short-term flexibility is achieved through available cash balances and its revolving 
credit facility. we have created internal teams for managing the integration and have created liaisons between teams to maximise 
the cross-selling opportunity to customers to take advantage of the increased range of services from our growing product 
portfolio. we have positioned the group as an extension to a customer’s existing it department 
guiding them through the complexities and developments in the market. we operate in a variety of vertical sectors but have weighting in not for profit, education, health 
services, financial services, insurance, technology and merchant and distribution sectors with a variety of well-known 
clients in these verticals. being a visa level 1 pci-dss service provider (highest level) and with our iso9001 and iso27001 credentials we are an 
attractive partner to anyone who wishes to ensure platforms are built and maintained to the highest of security standards. • network – the datacentres we utilise are linked by fibre that we lease. post balance sheet event
on 06 june 2017 the company entered into a deed of variation with the vendors of sys-pro, the resulting impact is a cash 
payment of £150k from the company to the vendors and a reduction of the contingent consideration (shown at fair value of 
£690k) to nil (see note 24). by order of the board

no. contingent consideration 
on the acquisition of q4ex ltd has now been fully settled given all performance criteria were satisfied. based on certain performance criteria, the vendors of sys-pro could be due further consideration of up to £1.865m. this is a post balance sheet event and has also removed some operational 
challenges by removing certain approval processes required with the vendors allowing for integration to be accelerated 
and is explained in more detail in note 24.
the directors are confident there is sufficient working capital within the group. sysgroup plc  annual report & accounts 2017 14
