headquartered in mexico city, 
fresnillo plc is the world’s 
leading silver producer and  
one of mexico’s largest gold 
producers. firstly, the second 
phase of our silver-gold san julián 
project was commissioned. this new 
mine, discovered by our exploration 
team, is a cornerstone of our future 
prospects and opens a promising, 
remote district to further growth. silver production

operational highlights
• annual silver production up 16.6%  
in line with guidance, driven by the  
first complete year of san julián  
phase i operating at full capacity  
and the start-up of operations at  
san julián phase ii, now operating  
at nameplate capacity. • gold production exceeded guidance 
principally as a result of the full year  
of operations at san julián phase i, 
although it reduced by 2.6% year-on-
year due to the expected reduction of 
gold inventories at herradura. • gold resources remained stable and 
gold reserves increased 22.7%. creating value

chairman’s statement
ten years of creating value 
through growth and returns
although the group has a history 
stretching back over a century, fresnillo 
only became a listed company in 2008. 
today, as we stand on the brink of our 
second decade, we can look back on 
our achievements with justifiable pride. we increased production, managed costs and expanded our pipeline, 
once again underlining our long-established commitment to create 
value through growth and returns. the company considers this a useful additional 
measure to help understand underlying factors 
driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and 
realised prices. we seek to create value for 
stakeholders across precious 
metal cycles, focusing on high-
potential silver and gold projects 
that can be developed into low 
cost, world-class mines. 1
 explore
our pipeline is the lifeblood of our business, and we 
invest continuously across price cycles in order to 
expand our resource base and replenish reserves. to find out more, visit us online

1 adjusted revenue is the revenue shown in the 
income statement adjusted to add back treatment 
and refining costs and gold, lead and zinc hedging. together, these strengths have 
combined to support a long-established track record  
of creating value through growth and returns. 3
 operate
we work hard to maximise the potential of our existing 
silver and gold mining operations at seven locations 
across mexico, all of which extract and process ore.
2018 marks the tenth anniversary of our ipo. it has 
been a decade of consistent and successful progress 
and we remain on track to achieve the demanding 
targets set at the time of the ipo. 4 on hold. one fatality  
is one too many, and our sincere 
condolences and support have been 
conveyed to the family of the victim. however, it is clear that there 
remains much work to do, particularly 
where contractors are concerned. dame judith is the third female 
appointment to the board in the past five 
years, and is currently one of two female 
members. our continuing 
success is a tribute to the long-term nature of our 
strategy, the skills and dedication of our people  
and the ongoing support of our stakeholders. 4
 sustain
we are committed to the responsible operation  
of our business, doing all we can to ensure the  
highest standards of health and safety, environmental 
stewardship and governance, while supporting our 
local communities and maintaining a strong culture  
of ethical behaviour . we are now exploring 
opportunities to apply the 
expertise and knowledge  
gained in mexico to locations 
elsewhere in latin america. we have 
taken a number of corrective steps  
to address these issues, including: 
strengthening our operational leadership 
team; improving contractor efficiency; 
and eliminating bottlenecks caused by 
inefficient working practices. this 
new approach has already borne fruit 
and will be extended in 2018. please see the social 
and sustainability report on pages 
74-103 for more details. q – what were the production 
headlines for the year? a – fresnillo’s operations are designed 
to deliver results across price cycles. for more about our exploration

1 estimated. we expect the construction of the  
new pyrites plant to significantly 
advance towards commissioning in 
2018, improving the gold and silver 
recovery from the tailings at both  
the fresnillo and saucito mines. in 
addition, we started construction of the 
second line at the dynamic leaching 
plant at herradura, which will improve 
gold recovery, particularly as we 
encounter increasing quantities of 
higher sulphide grade ore. the board 
expects to approve the development  
of our joint venture with mag silver at 
juanicipio in the first half of 2018, and 
we anticipate the start-up of production 
in the first half of 2020. juanicipio is 
the next major project for fresnillo and 
management is committed to ensuring 
that the mine fulfils its true potential. • gross profit and ebitda up 4.9%
