review
cpp’s europe and latin america region includes spain, italy, 
portugal, germany, turkey and mexico  europe and latin 
america represents 29% of the group’s full year revenue  
turkey has had a very strong year, growing revenues, profit and 
customer numbers  this growth has been achieved through 
building strong trusted relationships with business partners and 
developing profitable channel capability  turkey has developed a 
sustainable model that is based on a multi-product, multi-partner 
and multi-channel approach  additionally, in late 2017 we 
launched owl in turkey which has started well and we expect to 
continue to expand in 2018  
the core european markets delivered solid renewal 
performance, operational efficiencies and business partner 
engagement throughout 2017  these continue to be difficult 
markets in which to make quick progress and we continue to 
rely on their large, but declining renewal books  however, 
there has been positive progress during 2017 across these 
markets which we expect to generate new campaign launches 
and additional revenue 
we have implemented a change in operational structure in 
southern europe whereby spain, italy and portugal will 
operate as a regional hub led from madrid  this has also 
enabled a reinvigoration of the sales environment in these 
markets as well as operational efficiencies  in germany we have 
increased our growth capability through the appointment of 
senior business development and marketing roles  
mexico has had a difficult year and although revenue has 
increased marginally this has not been through the new 
revenue growth we anticipated  changes are being made to 
reinvigorate mexico which remains a market in which we see 
good potential  
uk and ireland
financial performance 
revenue for 2017 decreased by 22% to £22 3 million (2016: 
£28 8 million)  underlying operating loss is £2 4 million 
(2016: £1 5 million profit) 
review
the uk and ireland region accounted for 24% of the group’s 
full year revenue in 2017  new retail business performance in 
the uk and ireland continues to be constrained by restrictions 
relating to the ongoing vvop  as a result the uk services a 
renewal book where renewal rates have been strong and 
encouraging  good governance and excellent customer service 
remains a priority to our legacy book 
the acquisition of blink in march 2017 was an important step 
that has improved our it development capability  blink is in 
start-up phase and we have invested in developing it as an 
it hub since acquisition  blink is already demonstrating the 
enhanced capability it can bring to our delivery in market 
in addition, we have received fca permission to commence 
trading as a regulated insurance intermediary through blink 
uk and it is through this entity that we will seek to reinvigorate 
our uk presence
