targeted investments in people and processes, 
to extend our capabilities in areas directly 
relevant to customers in our existing contract 
logistics heartland. in an increasingly digitised market our 
systems, people and services underpin many 
multichannel operations. we provide a comprehensive 
range of services to support today’s 
multichannel retail environment. from order management to delivery 
and assembly of goods in the home we 
can streamline the process and deliver 
customer satisfaction. whether we are ensuring safe and effective operations today 
or creating the supply chain of the future, we work tirelessly 
to enable great businesses to become even greater . across the uk and ireland, we deliver the highest standards 
of service, excellence and innovation in order to help customers 
respond to changing market dynamics – and to reap the rewards 
of a more agile and effective supply chain. to date the group has experienced 
no significant impact from the brexit vote 
in june 2016, and we believe the group can 
adequately manage any future uncertainty 
that arises during the brexit process. robust cash generation supports limited 
scale investments in skills and technology 
capabilities to both protect and grow the 
business for the longer term without raising 
the group’s overall risk profile. this reflects the group’s strong 
operating profits and dividend policy outlined 
to shareholders last year when we resumed 
dividend payments. the proposed annual 
dividend is covered 3.0 times by underlying 
earnings. the board’s progressive dividend 
policy is unchanged. the group still has a sizeable pension deficit, 
and so the pension scheme will remain as a 
significant stakeholder for many years to come. service at the  
heart of our success

the group remains well positioned in its 
chosen markets and continues to perform 
robustly and deliver strong service levels for

forthcoming triennial review of the pension 
scheme and in agreeing an appropriate 
future funding plan with the scheme trustee. adrian colman has continued to 
strengthen the senior management team, 
with a healthy mixture of internal promotions 
and external appointments; broadening 
our talent pool is fundamental to the group
