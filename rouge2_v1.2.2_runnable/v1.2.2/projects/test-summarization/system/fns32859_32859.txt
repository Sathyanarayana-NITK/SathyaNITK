our response to the investigation
clearly, for much of 2017 , the board’s 
attention was dominated by the sfo 
investigation. in may, we took steps to 
ring-fence the investigation from petrofac’s 
day-to-day business operations, and 
ensure that we responded to the sfo. our response included: formation of a 
dedicated board committee to govern this 
matter; the appointment of a senior external 
specialist to oversee the company’s 
management of, and response to, the 
investigation; the restriction of group chief 
executive ayman asfari to his operational 
duties; and the suspension of group chief 
operating officer marwan chedid, who 
resigned from the board. further details of the 
investigation and our response are set out 
on page 78.
enhancing our compliance
prior to the instigation of this external 
investigation, steps had been taken to 
further enhance the company’s approach 
to compliance, including a root and branch 
review of all related policies and processes, 
as detailed on pages 64 and 65. in august 
2017 , a new compliance and ethics 
committee was formed. we have more 
than 35 years of expertise in this area and our 
services encompass both greenfield and 
brownfield developments. see page 35 see page 38 see pages 35-36 and 39

...giving us confidence 
for the future 
in 2017 , we delivered good operational performance, 
underpinned by high levels of project activity, good 
project execution, a recovery in new orders and 
strong financial discipline. we are pursuing a clear strategy: focusing on  
our core, delivering organic growth, and reducing 
capital intensity. the group 
has secured awards in a broad 
range of markets during the 
year. our projects cover upstream 
developments – both greenfield and brownfield, 
related energy infrastructure projects, and can 
include investment. during 2017 , 
we delivered and installed all of  
the modules, and contract 
completion is set for mid-2018. an important milestone was the 
completion and commissioning  
of the in salah southern fields 
development. on our upstream projects, we 
completed phase 1 of the khazzan 
central processing facility for bp  
and were awarded phase 2.  
we also secured a 10-year epcm 
framework agreement with 
petroleum development oman, 
which builds on our work on the 
rabab harweel integrated project 
and yibal khuff project. by the close of the year 
we had reached commissioning 
phase for both the petro rabigh 
petrochemicals plant and the 
jazan south tank farm project. with a healthy order backlog and strong credentials  
in promising sectors of the market, we have a resilient 
business that is well positioned for the future. 3 the group no longer recognises 
backlog in respect of the integrated 
energy services contracts. operational excellence

position and protecting our

the highlight was progress on  
the uz750 offshore project at the 
upper zakum oil field, our share of 
which is valued at us$3.5 billion. at the height of the project some 
14,000 workers were involved, 
including 5,000 onsite, and it 
reached more than 58 million  
man-hours lti free. in saudi arabia we continue  
to build on our downstream 
credentials. in ies, we made good progress in re-shaping our portfolio and improving 
performance. it is important to 
stress that these latter actions do not in any 
way seek to pre-judge the outcome of the 
sfo’s investigation. we took a 
particularly close interest in the headway 
the management team is making in 
delivering organic growth and further 
differentiating the business. rijnhard van tets
