 smart nebuliser 
technology, from the activaero acquisition, has enabled an almost 
one-hour reduction in the total daily treatment time for patients 
who are receiving treatment (iloprost) up to six times a day, a very 
meaningful improvement in patient quality of life. the business is differentiated by its unique set of capabilities, 
as medicines in the respiratory space become more complicated. vectura is one of the few companies globally with the expertise to 
formulate and deliver the most complex products for inhaled delivery. although tough, the experience we have 
gained through the review process and feedback we have received 
in relation to the formulation and device elements of the programme 
give us even greater conviction that we are one of the very few 
companies which has the capability to meet the fda’s high standards 
to develop complex inhaled generic drug-device combinations. commercial validation of

asthma
asthma is one of the most common non-communicable diseases.1
asthma is a chronic, reversible disease that inflames and narrows airways in 
the lungs, causing wheezing, chest tightness and coughing.2 not all asthma  
is the same and severe asthma can have a number of underlying causes.3
symptoms
• recurring attacks of breathlessness and wheezing that 
vary in severity and frequency from person to person
5
• asthma attacks – a sudden worsening of symptoms,  
can be unpredictable
• during an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial 
tubes swell, causing the airways to narrow and 
reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs

• post-period update – following the fda rejection of crl 
dispute process, hikma confirmed the enrolment of the first 
patients in repeat clinical programme for vr315 (us) will take 
place in the coming weeks. therefore, in order to support 
a clear and effective assessment of the group’s performance in 2017, the directors

a reconciliation of 2016 reported results to 2016 proforma full-year financial information

proforma financial information, underlying financial information adjusted ebitda, and 
adjusted operating profit, are not prepared in accordance with ifrs. underlying measures 
are reconciled back to their most directly comparable ifrs measures in the financial review. 3  underlying revenues exclude the impact of licensing milestones and development services
