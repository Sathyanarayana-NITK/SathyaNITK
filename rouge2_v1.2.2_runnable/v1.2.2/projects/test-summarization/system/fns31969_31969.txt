empowering our clients to save and invest with confidence is 
why we are in business, and i am pleased to report that we have 
delivered record levels of net new business and profits this year 
alongside maintaining our usual high client service standards. we aim to provide a lifelong, secure 
home for people’s savings and 
investments that offers great value,  
an incredible service and makes their 
financial life easy. the delivery of the new mobile 
app, the launch of our own equity funds and the lifetime isa are 
all examples of how we continue to deliver solutions to our 
clients and ensure they receive a great overall service. when reviewing performance the directors use a number of 
alternative performance measures which are explained on page 144 
followed by a glossary of terms used in this report. this allows wealth to begin to be transferred between 
generations and can be used for a number of different 
purposes, such as saving towards a child’s university fees or 
a deposit on their first home. 2 source: platforum uk d2c guide july 2017 . the current 
isa allowance was raised from £15,240 to £20,000 for the tax year 
commencing 6 april 2017 . on 6 april 2017 , the new lifetime isa (lisa) was launched. our lisa launched just after midnight on 
6 april 2017 and we opened our first one within two minutes. 2 based on may 2017 client survey of 14,674 respondents where service was voted as good, very good or excellent. we have overseen 
a transition to new executive leadership this year and i am 
encouraged by the energy and commitment they bring to making 
our business even better in the future. this is my last annual report 
as chairman and i am confident that i am leaving a business that 
is well positioned for our next phase of growth. overview of the year
our year commenced in the shadow of the surprise eu referendum 
result, which led to market volatility, uncertainty, which still 
remains, and consequent weak investor confidence. • new mobile phone app launched in february 2017 . the launch of our new app has been positively received and 
reinforces this. • launch of our new mobile phone app which has had over 486,000 
downloads. visits to our website from mobiles and tablets have 
now overtaken those via personal computers. board changes
it has been a busy year for changes to our board and executive 
committee. as announced last year, ian gorham decided to step 
down as ceo and this took effect from 9 february 2017 . ian was replaced by chris hill who initially joined as cfo 
in february 2016, before becoming deputy ceo in september 2016. 
his appointment followed a full assessment undertaken by the 
nomination committee. following an extensive search and rigorous assessment process, 
we were delighted that philip johnson joined in february 2017 and, 
after receiving regulatory approval, was appointed to the board in 
april 2017 . our purpose is to empower people  
to save and invest with confidence. junior isa
we offer an easy-to-manage tax-efficient way to save up 
to £4,128 for a child’s future this tax year. over the past 
year, we have listened to the external debate on the structure of 
executive remuneration, consulted with our shareholders and 
responded thoughtfully to their concerns. we are now proposing 
a revised remuneration policy which we believe strikes an 
appropriate balance between these factors and what is right for our 
organisation. clients

1 net promoter score, nps and the nps-related emoticons are registered service marks, and net promoter score and net promoter system are service marks of bain & company inc., satmetrix systems, inc. and fred reichheld. this flow of new business combined with significant market growth 
to drive aua to nearly £80 billion as at 30 june 2017 . following the 
interim dividend of 8.6p pence per share which was paid in march, 
this takes the total ordinary dividend for the year to 29.0 pence per 
share, an increase of 20% over 2016. this generates a total ordinary 
dividend payout ratio of 65% for the financial year ended 30 june 
2017 . the 2017 total dividend of 29.0p (2016 34.0p) per share is 
down by 15% reflecting our decision not to pay a special dividend 
this year. these assets are invested across the 
wide range of funds and shares we offer on our platform. while we have 
continued to invest part of the resultant revenue increase in our 
business to support growth, client service and broadening our 
offering, we were still able to deliver 21% growth in profit before tax 
to £265.8 million. the revised 
assessment means we had to retain an additional £50m of capital 
to ensure the group’s regulatory capital surplus during 2018 is 
sufficient. further details on our 
liquidity and capital management approach are contained in the 
operating and financial review.
