measuring instruments, software and services for some of the most  
technically-demanding industrial applications. we aim to enhance 
our profitable growth by providing our customers with key insights 
alongside our instruments and, to this end, we are progressively 
adding further software and analytical capabilities and test services 
to our product offerings. these are deemed alternative performance measures under 
the european securities and markets authority guidelines. the group continues to make good progress on the delivery of its 
strategy and during the year, we made a number of changes to our 
portfolio, including bolt-on acquisitions and a divestment. the board has, therefore, approved a share buy-back programme 
of £100 million to take place during 2018 and into 2019. the 
group has considerable financial flexibility and will continue to 
target acquisitions in support of its strategy. our people 
integral to the success of spectris are the skills, experience and 
technical know-how of our employees. like-for-like (‘lfl’) measures are  
stated at constant exchange rates and include acquisitions and disposals on a 
comparable basis. for a definition of the
