1. throughout these financial statements we make reference to adjusted numbers. adjusted basic earnings per share on a 
continuing basis grew by 5.5%. this results in a 
final dividend of 9.3 pence (2016: 9.3 pence) 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 
13.0 pence (2016: 13.0 pence). orders in the period increased by 4.3% 
to £350.7 million (2016: £336.1 million), 
orders at constant currency were down 
7.3%, predominantly due to lower orders 
in oi healthcare and industrial analysis. through our deep understanding of our customers’ world and our restless innovation we 
will change the art of the possible enabling our customers to address the challenges of 
the 21st century. we have also made good progress in 
developing and implementing the new 
horizon strategy to reposition our group 
for long‑term sustainable growth. this has 
seen some significant actions to manage 
our portfolio of businesses with the aim of 
accelerating our delivery of shareholder value. risk management
the board has 
accountability for 
reviewing and approving 
the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal 
controls including 
financial, operational 
and compliance controls 
and risk management. a full definition of adjusted numbers can be found in note 1. where we make reference to organic numbers these exclude the effect of acquisitions and disposals. where we make reference to 
constant currency numbers these are prepared using the exchange rates which prevailed in the previous year rather than the actual exchange rates which prevailed in the year. they have acted with impressive decisiveness 
in embedding a number of changes in our 
operating teams to raise the talent bar across 
our business. this is 
focused around the two anchors of returning 
to sustainable growth and improving margins 
by concentrating on market segments with 
long‑term growth drivers where we have 
the potential to become the market leader. 2016

our nanotechnology tools sector performed  
strongly and we saw good returns from the  
servicing of our own products. for example, in 
r&d we will prioritise our high‑impact 
projects and resource them from across 
the group. we monitor the proportion of our revenue 
which originates from products launched in 
the last three years (our vitality index).
