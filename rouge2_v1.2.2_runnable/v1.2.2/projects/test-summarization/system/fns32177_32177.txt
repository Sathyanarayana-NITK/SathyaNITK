03 3i group annual report and accounts 2017
the group delivered another robust 
performance in fy2017 . i am 
conﬁdent that the group will remain 
opportunistic but disciplined as we 
navigate what promises to be another 
year of signiﬁcant uncertainty. overview
3i group annual report and accounts 2017 04
chief executive’s  
review
we continued to make very strong 
progress at 3i in fy2017 . it offers over  
6,000 different items, with more than 
150 new products a week and its 
range includes an increasing number 
of a-brands and own-label products. its product range consists of 13 
categories, with products sourced from 
over 400 suppliers, offered at low prices 
due to action’s scale and highly efﬁcient 
supply chain. it buys in large volumes and 
stocks its stores daily from its distribution 
centres in the netherlands and france. it is now present in more than 
60 markets through a network 
of c.250 brand stores. cash realisations, including the proceeds 
from the sale of debt management, were 
strong at £1,308 million and we saw a good 
step forward in cash investment to £638 
million. but 3i is not just about action. we wrote down the investment to nil 
and the business was subsequently sold 
through an administration process, with 
the proceeds being insufﬁcient to return 
any value to 3i, resulting in a total write-
down in the year of £49 million. in europe, we announced the launch of 
a new £700 million fund, managed by 3i, 
to purchase a portfolio of assets from the 
eiser global infrastructure fund. performance and dividend
the group’s total return increased by 
93% to £1,592 million (2016: £824 million). net asset value increased to 604 pence 
per share (31 march 2016: 463 pence) and 
our return on opening shareholders’ funds 
was 36% (2016: 22%). this is made up 
of the balance of the base dividend 
(8 pence per share, after the 8 pence 
interim dividend paid in january 2017) 
and an additional ﬁnal dividend of 10.5 
pence per share. a measure of the success of these changes 
can be seen in this year’s ﬁnancial results;  
3i generated a total return on shareholders’ 
funds of £1,592 million, or 36% (2016: £824 
million, or 22%), ending the year with a 
nav per share of 604 pence (31 march 
2016: 463 pence). 3i group plc

what we do
3i is an investment company with two 
complementary businesses, private equity 
and infrastructure, specialising in core 
investment markets in northern europe 
and north america. private equity 
delivered very strong returns, driven 
by signiﬁcant portfolio earnings growth. a strong market 
for realisations meant that we were, as 
anticipated, net divestors during fy2017 . board changes
i am pleased to welcome stephen daintith, 
chief financial ofﬁcer of rolls-royce 
holdings, who joined the board on 
1 october 2016. stephen brings ﬁnancial, 
operating and international experience 
across a range of relevant sectors, 
including consumer and digital, and has 
already made a strong contribution to the 
board and its committees. i would like to 
thank martine for her valuable contribution 
since 2012 during a period of signiﬁcant 
transformation for the group. action was the strongest performer 
again; it is a very special company and a 
low price, consumer champion. 2 the sale of our debt management business completed on 3 march 2017. the total return from the debt management business sold 
to investcorp has been classiﬁed as discontinued operations and the prior period results have been re-presented. 3 operating cash proﬁt has been redeﬁned in the year and the prior year comparative restated. the sale of debt 
management, completed in march 2017 , 
has simpliﬁed and focused the group 
on its two principal businesses, both 
of which performed well. martine verluyten has decided not to 
seek re-election at the annual general 
meeting on 29 june 2017 . 08

1 certain ﬁnancial measures used in our annual report, such as operating cash proﬁt, are not deﬁned under ifrs and are therefore 
termed apms. we repaid our €331 million bond in march 
2017 and ended the year with a net cash 
balance of £419 million and liquidity of 
£1,323 million (31 march 2016: net cash of 
£165 million and liquidity of £1,352 million). in recognition of the strong level of cash 
realisations (including the proceeds 
from the sale of our debt management 
business) and taking into account the 
strength of the investment pipeline, the 
board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend 
of 18.5 pence per share (2016: 16 pence 
per share) for fy2017 . the total dividend for 
the year of 26.5 pence per share reﬂects 
the board’s continuing conﬁdence in 
the group’s future prospects and cash 
generation capability.
