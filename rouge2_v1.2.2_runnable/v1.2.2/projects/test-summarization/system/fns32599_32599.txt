 as a percentage  
of tangible equity value. it is a well-established 
specialist market, lending principally to the  
‘non-standard’ borrower population – defined 
as people regularly refused credit by mainstream 
lenders. what we do
our customers are usually ineligible 
for credit from mainstream lenders. by offering small, affordable loans of 
up to £1,000, either in cash or on a 
morses club card, we proudly provide 
our customers with an essential service. non-standard credit is the provision 
of secured and unsecured credit 
to consumers other than through 
mainstream lenders. we operate 
primarily via a network of self-employed 
agents from the same communities as 
their customers. digital opportunity
we believe that new digital technologies 
will change the way many traditional 
hcc lenders interact with their customers. our developing technology platforms and expertise will not 
only give us the ability to better support our customers and 
agents, but also enable us to address other segments of the 
far larger uk non-standard lending market. we are exploring further 
enhancements we can make to 
customer communications and loan 
management using digital technology 
and will be looking to create an online 
customer portal. it is estimated that the uk non-standard 
borrower population is around 10m people. morses club plc is a uk  
consumer finance business  
in the home collected credit (hcc) 
market, with a proud heritage  
going back over 130 years. – developed a broader range of 
products with the introduction of 
cashless lending (morses club card) 
and online lending (dot dot loans). – developed our core business and 
supplemented it with 105 new agent 
territory builds in the year.
