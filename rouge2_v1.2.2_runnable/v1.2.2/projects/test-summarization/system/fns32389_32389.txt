we believe in better
as the need to create financial security in later 
life becomes increasingly important for us all, 
xafinity is changing the way that we think about 
pensions and the way that they are structured, 
protected and delivered. better schemes, information, technology and decisions. better service expectations and ultimately better financial  
outcomes for trustees, businesses, members and our shareholders. of these, only 13 are on the pensions 
regulator’s ‘master trust assurance’ list. reading, leeds, stirling, belfast, london and manchester. our objective is to become the clearly 
differentiated alternative to the ‘big 3’ 
providers, mercer, willis towers watson and 
aon hewitt. this is known as ‘trivial commutation’. i look forward to participating with colleagues 
in the next phase of sustained growth for 
xafinity. the challenges are widespread. this continues to happen. we 
understand about 
helping people and 
developing relationships 
that last. other

the defined benefit market 
remains large and challenging,  
and is not going away
defined benefit (db) pension schemes have 
frequently made headlines in the business 
sections of uk newspapers, and more recently 
they have reached the front pages too, with 
high profile problems at companies like bhs 
(where members of the scheme will not 
receive their full benefits after the corporate 
insolvency) and tata steel (where the large 
pension scheme presented challenges in the 
restructuring). but pension promises 
must be honoured; closing a scheme does not 
remove the liabilities built up in the past, 
often over a period of decades. rather, there are clear 
opportunities for firms – such as xafinity – able 
to offer genuinely independent advice about 
fiduciary management, and demand for such 
advice has increased (chart 3). we are actuaries, consultants and 
administrators working to protect and 
enhance the benefits of hundreds of 
thousands of pension scheme members. we bring cutting edge solutions for the 
benefit of pension scheme trustees, 
members and sponsoring employers. pensions advisory

why invest 
in xafinity? our successful listing in an ipo 
market dampened by concerns over brexit was 
testament to xafinity’s quality of earnings and 
growth potential, with the offer at 139p per 
ordinary share being fully subscribed by a 
shareholder base of longer-term investors. dividend policy
the board are proposing a final dividend of 
0.73p per share, effectively a post-listing 
dividend for the period from market 
admission to 31 march 2017. this final 
dividend will be payable on 28 september 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 september 2017.
the board intend to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy, with a two-thirds/
one-third approximate split of the total 
annual dividend for the final and interim 
dividends respectively and, subject to 
prudent financial discipline and future 
group results, expect to pay as dividends 
each year up to 67 per cent of adjusted 
profits after tax. strategy and culture 
xafinity combines expertise, insight and 
technology to address the needs of pension 
scheme clients. in particular, the board’s near-term strategy 
addresses the potential of an increasing 
market for de-risking services to defined 
benefit pension schemes and the optimal use 
in the defined contribution market of 
xafinity’s leading npt master trust platform. implementing the board’s strategy for the 
group is an experienced and dynamic 
management team, with an agile client-facing 
corporate culture which puts the customer at 
the heart of the xafinity business, aligned 
with colleagues united and motivated to go 
the extra mile in delivering market leading 
solutions to a diversified client base. it is against 
this backdrop that db schemes frequently 
present a very big challenge for company 
sponsors, and for the trustees who shoulder 
the responsibility of looking after the best 
interests of pension scheme members. our unique ‘centre of excellence’ was instrumental in us being appointed. we 
developed our “centre of excellence”.
