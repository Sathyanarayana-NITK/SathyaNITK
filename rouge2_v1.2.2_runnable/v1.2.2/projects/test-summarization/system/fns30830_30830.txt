given rise to client operating cost pressures, which have a constraining 
effect on it investment. as mentioned earlier, the group has made substantial progress in 
expanding the adoption of clareti solutions globally. our legacy business remained stable during the year with some 
changes in the mix as we proactively manage the portfolio to  
optimise returns. clareti analytics and clareti adapters are expected to provide upsell 
opportunity and we also expect to see revenue growing within the 
installed base. regulatory drivers are increasingly behind this requirement 
and it was pleasing to see three regtech deals signed in 2017 . • 15 new ctc clients in 2017 across the us, canada, 
australia, the uk and europe. • strong performance from north america following 
direct sales investment in 2016 and 2017 . the group has achieved notable 
sales success in north america following its sales and marketing 
investment in the region. the important 
north america market contributed 39% of new clareti sales in 2017 
following investment in the direct sales team. at the heart of this is the clareti platform. clareti was designed as a faster, more 
agile, more visionary data integrity 
platform that pushes the boundaries 
of innovation. key features include:
 • flexible workflow and business rules
 • rapid onboarding
 • matching engine
 • cloud native
 • in-memory data grid
 • machine learning
 • embedded analytics

leading software and services

integrity solutions. all financial targets were met or exceeded following the continuing 
successful deployment of the clareti platform across a variety

support the ongoing investments in direct sales, in addition to forming

ongoing investments
the board continues to believe there is a very significant market 
opportunity for data integrity and control solutions and that ongoing 
investment in key strategic areas is essential. regulations such as 
mifid ii, oats, cat and h4 include complex data processing and 
control requirements, with the very real risk of regulatory fines and 
reputational damage in the event of breaches. we 
continue to track brexit developments closely and are ready to react to 
potential of threats to our business (in particular to our emerging european 
business) arising from prevailing uncertainties or unfavourable trading 
conditions. however , whilst our clareti business remains weighted towards 
the uk and north america as it currently is, we do not foresee any material 
adverse impact from any of the realistic outcomes of brexit negotiations. the priority remains to manage 
the inevitable non-clareti portfolio 
run-off profitably. strategic report
