executive review
group operating results
as anticipated and as highlighted 
earlier in the year, the outcome 
for the group’s full year revenues 
of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m) were 
relatively flat reflecting the impact 
of the eu referendum. these 
plans, alongside working with 
triconnex to ensure that the early 
customer intelligence that triconnex 
becomes aware of is utilised in 
the most effective manner, give 
us confidence that we have an 
established route to continue to 
grow the tamdown business. the eu referendum had a 
limited negative impact on the order 
book of triconnex mainly due to the 
longer lead times in designing and 
implementing utility networks. people
a primary driver to the group’s 
success is the team of highly skilled, 
driven and loyal employees across 
the businesses. nexus places great 
importance on engaging with, 
and developing its employees and 
providing a platform for personnel 
growth and successful career 
development. on behalf of the 
board, i would like to congratulate 
and thank them for their continued 
hard work and dedication. additionally, we aim to attract, 
retain and develop the best 
people by investing in training 
and support which means we 
have a knowledgeable workforce 
with transferable skills. nexus infrastructure plc | annual report and financial statements 2017
6  in addition to the help to 
buy funding, the government 
announced in the budget a 
variety of support packages 
to address the structural 
undersupply in the uk 
housebuilding market. the 
new policies are expected to 
bring the total support for 
housing to at least £44bn over 
the next five years, with the 
intention of increasing the 
number of houses completed 
to 300,000 per year by 2025. 
in addition, the government 
have committed to improving 
the planning environment and 
making more public sector 
land available for residential 
development. we’re confident that both 
tamdown and triconnex will 
benefit from this landscape 
of structural undersupply in 
housing, government stimulus 
for the sector and a drive 
to increase volumes from 
customers operating in the 
affordable housing market. we offer 
apprenticeships, high levels of 
training and development, a 
graduate programme and a 
degree programme. revenue

strategic report financial statements governance at a glance
nexus infrastructure currently comprises two 
separately managed and operated businesses; 
tamdown and triconnex. in spite of 
this market backdrop, the group 
is reporting revenue for the year 
of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m), and 
an operating profit of £9.3m 
(2016: £10.4m). revenues 
for tamdown were £105.6m 
(2016: £112.4m) and were broadly 
offset by the 26.3% increase in 
triconnex’s revenues to £29.5m 
(2016: £23.3m). gross profit for the year increased 
to £27.2m (2016: £26.3m), with the 
overall gross margin improving 
by 78 basis points to 20.2% 
(2016: 19.4%). confident outlook for the 
year ahead. the business has a  
well-established market position 
having been in operation for 
over 40 years and works with 
nine of the top ten largest uk 
housebuilders. as previously reported, the eu 
referendum caused a slowdown 
in tendering activity and delays to 
customers awarding new contracts 
during the second half of 2016 
with a corresponding delay to work 
commencing on site. in addition to organic growth, 
further growth will come from the 
successful sourcing, execution and 
integration of chosen acquisitions. welcome to the

the revenue for tamdown 
decreased by 6.1% to £105.6m,

self-lay was introduced in 2013 which
