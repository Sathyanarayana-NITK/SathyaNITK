our partnerships division 
specialises in urban regeneration 
of public sector land, delivering 
private and affordable homes in 
partnership with local authorities 
and housing associations. it delivers private, affordable 
and private rental sector (“prs”) homes on 
larger sites, typically public sector brownfield 
sites or local authority estate regeneration. the land is typically sourced via public 
procurement or direct negotiation and is 
developed in partnership with local authorities, 
housing associations or prs providers. we are 
examining the way that this process can be 
enhanced to include all windows, first-fix plumbing 
and electrical insulation and plasterboard in a 
closed panel system. priorities of the board

governance as a core and vital discipline 
complementing our desire to continually improve 
upon the success of the group on behalf of

year of significant progress completing 
3,389 homes while maintaining a 
strong balance sheet and with 
excellent visibility over our future 
growth ambitions. we maintained our focus on capital discipline 
and ended the year with £77.4m of net cash 
on the balance sheet. overview of the market

remains positive with continued strong customer 
demand, favourable mortgage lending conditions

decline in the group private average selling price 
(“asp”) to £430,000 (2016: £465,000) more 
than offset by an increase in affordable asp. we are 
recruiting more apprentices, graduates and 
trainees than ever before. in may, we were delighted 
to announce the reshaping of our executive 
committee following the retirement of richard 
cherry, with ian kelley, nick worrall and phillip 
lyons, who joined the business as chief executive 
of our housebuilding division, joining the 
executive team. the quality and commitment of our people 
was recognised with a number of awards during 
the year including “large housebuilder of the 
year” at the housebuilder awards. t o mitigate this risk, we are recruiting a record 
number of apprentices and management trainees 
and have expanded our graduate recruitment 
programme. our year-end private forward order 
book is at a record level at £242.4m, which, 
combined with a strong pipeline in both 
divisions, positions us well to achieve our 
ambitious growth plans. returns to shareholders
our share price performed well over the course 
of the financial year, reflecting the performance 
of the business along with continued investor 
education. during 2017, particular areas 
of focus were to develop policies and procedures 
to address the new consumer code for home 
builders and to prepare for the introduction of 
the criminal finance act and the general data 
protection regulation. well positioned for growth
during 2017 the business continued to perform 
well, delivering on the key targets set out at 
our initial public offering (“ipo”) in february 
2016. political support for the housebuilding 
industry remains strong and we welcome the 
government’s commitment to housing with 
the white paper “fixing our broken housing 
market” and subsequently announced increased 
funding for both affordable housing and the 
help to buy scheme. it operates in outer london, 
the west midlands and
