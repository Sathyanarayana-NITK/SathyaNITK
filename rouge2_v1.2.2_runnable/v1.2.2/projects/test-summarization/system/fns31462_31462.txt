these self-help 
programmes included the implementation 
of a new payroll management system late 
in fy16 and improved rents at four sites as 
a result of negotiated lease re-gears, both 
of which combined to drive underlying 
operating cost reductions of around 1%. this improvement in 
reliability has enabled us to improve lane 
utilisation at peak times, leading to improved 
revenue and higher levels of net promoter 
scores (nps), with the trial sites reporting 
nps in excess of 70%. a total 
of 37 sites in the estate have 
now been completed.”

annual report and accounts 2017 ten entertainment group plc the group operates in the tenpin bowling 
sub-sector of the broader uk leisure market, 
which is estimated to be worth approximately 
£80bn annually. our growth strategy is designed to support 
and strengthen our business model, and is 
focused on three simple routes: incremental 
organic growth; growth through acquisition; 
and ongoing investment into both our 
estate and into our support platform. our self-managed growth strategy 
is clearly defined and is driven by the 
three routes, but we are also determined 
to see our available market grow as 
consumers gain enthusiasm for spending 
time and their income on more experiences 
and less traditional product purchases. ten entertainment group operates with a 
simple, profitable, proven business model 
and with a proposition that is entirely 
customer driven, underpinned by a 
strong culture formed and protected 
by our colleagues. during april 2017, we welcomed our new 
shareholders to benefit from our robust, 
de-leveraged but growing business. our strong balance sheet is currently 
de-levered specifically to protect against 
any downside risk on future covenants 
and give us scope for assurance and flexibility 
to sensibly use free cash for dividends 
or acquisitions. this ought to be a compelling case for 
many shareholders seeking security of 
income returns coupled with longer-term 
prospects of capital upside. chief executive’s statement

tenpin bowling, we offer a broad selection 
of family entertainment options including 
amusement machines, table-tennis, pool 
tables, soft play and laser games. the sites have transitioned well to the 
tenpin model and, overall, are performing 
in line with our original expectations. the newly 
created and recently recruited role of 
digital marketing director will be instrumental 
in developing and focusing our plans in 
this area. we have 42 sites across the country, with an average of 24 lanes

annual report and accounts 2017 ten entertainment group plc ten entertainment group is focused 
on delivering family entertainment in 
a growing sector of the leisure market. the refurbishments completed at the end 
of fy16 at five of the sites acquired in fy15 
supported strong like-for-like growth in 
these sites, in what was their second year 
under the tenpin brand. the combination of these achievements 
has resulted in strong ebitda growth 
of 14% during the year and therefore we 
can confidently propose a payment of a 
maiden full-year dividend. i am pleased 
to report group adjusted earnings per 
share of 16.2p. one way we can see this is the most crucial 
measure: our impressive, sector-leading 
net promoter score of 66%, up from 49% 
in 2016. we know it is a crucial correlate 
to sales growth, and therefore core 
underlying profit growth. the board are recommending a final 
dividend of 7.0p per share, resulting in 
a full-year dividend of 10.0p per share. this is because firstly, many more marginal 
gains exist across our operations; secondly, 
because value has been proven in acquiring 
single units, converting them to “the tenpin 
way” and of course accruing scale benefits; 
and lastly, because sustainability of profit 
growth derived from the lifeblood of a steady 
drip feed of capital to maintain modernity 
and relevance to our consumers and attract 
high-quality operating talent. this is supportive 
of our unique tenpinisation strategy, our 
proven process of converting acquisitions 
to the t enpin model, whereby on acquisition 
sites go through a seven-step integration plan, 
introducing new company controls and it 
and embedding operational systems to create
multi-channel connectivity, maximise 
yield and review for further capital 
investment, all supported by our skilled 
people. pins & strings is an innovative, new 
generation bowling machine that requires 
less maintenance, is simpler to operate and 
provides improved reliability for customers, 
demonstrated by improvements in the key 
games played per stop metric. we are 
encouraged with the early results at these 
sites and evidence confirms that pins & 
strings has the potential to both improve 
the cost efficiency of our sites and also 
improve the overall customer experience. we also have a great food and drink offering that customers can 
enjoy while they play, without the need to step away from their 
lanes thanks to our iserve technology. we put our customers at the heart of everything we do, and 
our 1,100 employees all strive to ensure our customers have 
a fantastic customer experience every time they visit us. our mission is to make families and friends 
happy; to entertain and enthral profitably. the way that people and families interact 
has changed rapidly in recent times and 
we are able to bring families and friends 
together to play, and to have fun in a very 
modern way through the tenpin brand. ten entertainment group plc annual report and accounts 2017
