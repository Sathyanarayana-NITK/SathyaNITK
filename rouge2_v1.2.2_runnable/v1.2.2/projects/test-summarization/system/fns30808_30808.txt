chairman’s statement
dear shareholders,
this is expected to be the last bgeo annual 
report. the forthcoming demerger of the group, 
announced in july 2017, reflects both the end 
of an era and the start of a new one. the banking business will continue to aim  
to benefit from the underpenetrated banking sector in 
georgia, primarily through its retail banking services. georgia’s fast-growing economy provides opportunities 
in a number of underdeveloped local markets and  
the investment business will aim to capture growth 
opportunities in the georgian corporate sector. we have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected periods, while the change did not have any material impact on the income statement. therefore, banking business balance sheet and income statement accounts, and the ratios  
have been updated accordingly for prior periods presented to reflect these changes. in may 2017, we held the first regional conference of wealth management in tbilisi. the conference was attended by leading financial institutions from the 
countries of europe and the middle east, including israel and russia, as well as by international clients and 
professionals with legal and taxation backgrounds. for the past couple of years, m

 has established itself as one of the most recognisable and trustworthy 
residential housing brands in the country. economically, georgia is doing exceptionally 
well in a difficult region and world. the hotel in tbilisi is currently under construction. ggu has two main business lines – water utility and electric power generation. in its water utility business, ggu 
has a natural monopoly that supplies water and provides a wastewater service to 1.4 million people (more than 
one-third of georgia’s population) in three georgian cities: tbilisi, mtskheta and rustavi. in the electric power 
business, ggu has a portfolio of three hydropower generating facilities (an additional 2.9mw facility under 
management) with a total of 149.3mw capacity. our macro and sectoral research currently covers various sectors of the georgian economy and developments 
taking place in regional economies. i believe 
three key factors make the georgian situation 
positive in the long term:
1. macroeconomic stability. neil janin
chairman
2. many healthy and developing sectors, in line 
with government policies:
a. the financial sector, of which we are part
b. infrastructure development, especially in 
the power sector
c. healthcare, where we participate in the 
universal healthcare access policies of 
government
d. finally, and more long term, the 
government has a programme to 
improve education, and to make the 
public sector more efficient. 3. good government
a. strong anti-corruption policies. about us
