4g mobile speed and 
coverage ahead of the uk
comparing the latest 
published figures on 
opensignal’s live app and 
website (opensignal.com), 
manx telecom’s average 
island-wide speed of 
27.74mbps and our 99% 
4g coverage placed  
us ahead of all major  
uk cities. our ultima 
and ultima plus high-speed broadband services are now 
available to 93% of households, and our ‘lightning-fast’ 
optimal fibre products are being rolled out in 2018.
mobile
our mobile business offers pre-paid and post-paid 
tariffs to all market segments, supports inbound 
roaming traffic from international visitors, and sells 
mobile handsets, laptops and accessories. vannin ventures –
our dedicated 100%-owned subsidiary focusing on 
new innovative technologies, products and services. partitionware –
an isle of man-based company offering a wide 
range of innovative telecoms solutions to service 
providers worldwide. best known for its 
financial services industry, the island 
has successfully diversified across 
sectors including e-business, e-gaming 
and high-tech manufacturing. dividend
the board has declared a final 
dividend of 7.5p per share to be paid 
on 29 june 2018. this will bring the 
full year dividend to 11.4p (2016: 10.9p). our net debt/underlying ebitda 
ratio of 2.1x (2016: 1.9x) and £10m 
of committed and unutilised loan 
facilities at year end means that 
we are well capitalised. monthly pricing 
options starting from £42 per month 
were also announced. high service standards
 – monthly transactional nps (net promoter score) 
results benchmark positively against uk operators. see manxtelecom.com/roaming for more details. it’s also at the 
very heart of the internet of things 
(iot) market, in which almost anything 
– processes, machines and everyday 
objects – can automatically exchange 
data. the markets we 
operate in are characterised by:
 – regular technology changes. – product convergence. and in international markets we have 
a growing portfolio of ‘smart sim’ solutions, marketed since 2000 
by our global solutions team through key partners. chairman’s statement
our core business continues to 
perform solidly. this revenue 
reduction was offset in part through 
continued growth in our global 
solutions business, driven by our 
strongest signal mobile solution, 
m2m, and international traveller 
propositions. the agreement signed 
with china unicom in december 
2016 to provide connectivity for 
china unicom’s uk based mobile 
virtual network operator (mvno) 
service grew slowly in 2017, due 
to technological challenges which 
have now been addressed, and  
we expect this agreement to bring 
further growth in 2018.
our transformation programme, 
launched in october 2016, 
is progressing well with the 
implementation of it systems 
and improvements in our internal 
processes and organisational 
structure. manx telecom plc annual report and accounts 2017

business (fixed line, broadband and

will be supported by continued 
improvement in our on-island network

revenues in our core lines of business. this supports our progressive 
dividend policy, which has been maintained since 
admission at an annual increase of c.5%. in 2017 , 
we saw a 43% increase in data usage 
on our fixed line network and a 89% 
increase in data usage on our
