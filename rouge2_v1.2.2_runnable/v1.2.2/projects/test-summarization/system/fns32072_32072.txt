menus and dishes across pub company. we have been focusing particularly on improving the quality and consistency

loyalty. at our year end we operated 2,924 managed, tenanted, leased and 
franchised pubs, restaurants and hotels, including well known brands 
such as our greene king locals estate, hungry horse, flaming grill, 
farmhouse inns and chef & brewer. we have a proud history of brewing 
award-winning ales for more than 200 years and our leading ale brand 
portfolio includes old speckled hen, greene king ipa, abbot ale 
and belhaven best. recent results

based at greene king’s brewery in bury st edmunds. through our proven business model and our focus on results, we aim to 
continue delivering long-term growth and returns to our shareholders. this means 
we can now give all our focus to pursuing opportunities to grow and take 
share, prioritising long-term value creation, while delivering continued strong 
cash generation and maintaining a robust balance sheet. ours is a strategically 
strong and well managed business which is positioned to address the 
tougher trading environment forecast for the next few years. overview
