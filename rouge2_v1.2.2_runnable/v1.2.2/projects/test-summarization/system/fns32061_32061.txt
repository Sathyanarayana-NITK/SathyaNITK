technical	expertise,	innovation,	safety	and	the	successful	
delivery	of	value‑engineered	solutions	to	our	customers. uk	construction	output	grew	by	2.2%	
for	the	same	period,	reflecting	our	view	that	we	continue	to	grow	our	
market	share. sales to 
the	commercial	and	industrial	sector	reduced	by	17.0%	to £18.8m	
(2016:	£22.7m)	which	was,	in	part	a	reflection	of	some	short‑term	
market	uncertainty	and	the	deferral	or	cancellation	of several	
projects	but also	reflects	the	completion	of	several	large	education	
and	retail	projects	by	the	company	in	the	previous	year. the division’s	profit	result	though	was	adversely	impacted	by	the
