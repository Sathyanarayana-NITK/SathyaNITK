the framework of oversight, controls and reporting provided 
by capco’s governance structure supports the business  
and allows capco to operate with transparency to achieve  
its objectives. demetra’s departure unfortunately sets back our 
gender diversity aspirations at board level. this has 
resulted in significant votes against two of our agm resolutions 
and capco’s inclusion in the investment association’s public 
register of shareholder dissent. this has been a year of considerable 
change in the macroeconomic and political context in which capco 
operates and i am grateful for the directors’ diligence and 
engagement throughout the year. 1

the earls court landowners’ map above is indicative. the 
floral court development is nearing completion with the courtyard 
and restaurant openings expected over the coming months. at earls court partnership limited (“ecpl”), our investment 
vehicle with transport for london (“tfl”), the final phase of the 
complex demolition of the former earls court exhibition centres 
has been successfully completed in preparation for future 
development. ecpl,  
the investment vehicle with tfl, which represents our principal 
investment in earls court, successfully completed the final phase  
of the complex demolition of the former exhibition centres, which 
prepares the land for development. our  
key assets are the covent garden and  
earls court estates. the value of our investments at earls court has however 
been impacted by challenges in the london residential market. the covent 
garden estate is benefiting from a period of significant investment 
made over recent years, creating an inviting environment with a 
wide variety of british heritage, independent and global brands 
offering a broad selection of retail and dining experiences across  
the estate. in addition, a number of 
acquisitions have extended our presence on floral street. capital & counties properties plc
