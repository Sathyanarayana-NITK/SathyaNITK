this is our branded retail sales expressed 
as a percentage of the retail sales of the 
categories in which we operate. responding quickly 
to these challenges, we have reviewed 
our strategy to deliver a more balanced 
focus on revenue, cost efficiency and 
cash generation. however, management have moved quickly to adapt 
to the changing environment and refine our strategy to 
deliver more balanced progress in terms of revenue, 
cost efficiency and cash generation in the future. management have worked hard to recover these 
cost increases through a combination of internal 
efficiencies, adjustments to promotional mechanics 
and, where necessary, limited price increases 
although it’s true to say this has not been easy and 
has taken longer than expected. to help us adapt to the challenging market,   
management announced a cost reduction and 
efficiency programme in january 2017, including 
both operational efficiencies in the supply chain and 
our head office functions. why is this important? why is this important? why is this important? why is this important? annual report and

the uk grocery industry has gone 
through a period of rapid change during 
the financial year. explore our report
*  a definition and reconciliation of non gaap measures 
to reported measure is set out on pages 16 and 17. our performance was impacted 
by a change in retailer promotional strategies which 
reduced category volumes, a time lag in recovering 
input cost inflation and a period of warmer than  
usual weather which impacted grocery in the  
second quarter. after a period of lower food prices, rising commodity 
costs, compounded by the devaluation of sterling 
following the eu referendum last year, led to the  
re-emergence of food price inflation in the uk. strategic report
