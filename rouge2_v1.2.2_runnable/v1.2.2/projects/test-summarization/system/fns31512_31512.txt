about 4imprint group
we are the leading direct

per share increased by 18% to 103.15c. this will be paid in may 2018 in 
addition to, and at the same time as, 
the final dividend of 40.00c per share. paul moody

revenue for the year was $627.5m, an increase 
of 12% over 2016. all of this revenue growth 
was organic. there has been no change of 
any substance in the structure and activities 
of the central function. evidence of the importance of 
a strong culture was on full display during 
parts of the third and fourth quarter of 
2017, as our us team handled disruption 
caused by hurricanes harvey and irma with 
determination and professionalism, caring 
for customers and working seamlessly with 
suppliers who were impacted by the storms. as a 
result we expect that 2018 operating profit 
is likely to be flat against 2017, reflecting 
the longer investment period that this 
type of marketing typically requires. this is an evolution of our previous financial 
strategy of organic revenue growth subject 
to maintaining broadly constant operating 
margin percentage; it does not represent a 
wholesale change in direction or philosophy. we have consistently delivered market-beating 
organic revenue growth. in 
base currency the growth rate was 16%, 
outpacing that of the uk market and 
indicative of a strengthening customer file. revenue per marketing dollar was $5.67 in 
2017 compared to $5.77 in 2016. this was 
in line with our expectations for the year, 
and was consistent with our targets for 
balancing revenue growth and profitability. operating margin percentage at this 
level was 7.27% versus 7.57% in the prior 
year due principally to increased investment 
in marketing, which was 14% higher than 
2016. gross margin percentage was slightly 
lower than prior year, but remains broadly 
stable. operations are focused around a highly 
developed direct marketing business  
model which provides millions of potential 
customers with access to tens of thousands 
of customised products. organic growth is delivered by using a wide 
range of data-driven, offline and online direct 
marketing techniques to capture market share 
in the large and fragmented promotional 
product markets that we serve. our target 
is to achieve $1bn in group revenue by 2022.

most of our revenue is generated in north 
america, serviced from the principal office in 
oshkosh, wisconsin. uk and ireland
customers in the uk and irish markets are 
served from an office in manchester, uk. the group ended the year in good 
financial health with a cash balance of 
$30.8m (2016: $21.7m), again reflecting 
the low fixed capital requirements 
and efficient working capital 
characteristics of our business model. with our pension commitments 
much reduced, we have a firm and 
unencumbered financial base. the cash 
demands from our legacy defined benefit 
pension obligations are now predictable, 
and small in the context of the financial 
strength of the group. accordingly, we 
have developed new balance sheet funding 
guidelines that will allow us to retain 
financial and operational flexibility through 
different economic cycles. in this report

chairman’s statement
the group delivered another strong operational 
and financial performance in 2017.
profit before tax was $40.7m, compared to 
$34.2m in 2016. this 19% increase reflects 
a much lower exceptional charge of $0.5m 
(2016: $2.9m) showing tangible benefit 
from the successful completion of our 
pension de-risking exercise. in addition, we 
have reconfirmed our commitment to both 
progressive regular dividends and to our 
remaining pension obligations. finally, excess 
cash above these commitments is available 
for distribution to shareholders. we have a distinct cultural identity within 
4imprint, based on exacting standards 
of customer service. therefore 
we anticipate an investment phase during 
2018 as we apply our familiar and proven 
“test, read, adjust” approach to rolling out 
this new component of our strategy. it will vary year-to-year to some degree based on 
a variety of factors (e.g. our aim is to deliver consistent performance and 
attractive tsr. what we do where we do it
we make it easy for our 
customers to promote their 
service, product or event. our customers know that 
promotional products from 
4imprint’s extensive range along 
with personal, expert service on 
every order will ensure that their 
name – and brand – looks great 
in front of their target audience. 2
looking after our customers
we have an exceptional culture revolving 
around the delivery of remarkable customer 
service, and an industry-leading customer 
guarantee. the professionalism 
and talent of our us team members 
was demonstrated to great effect as 
they helped our customers and affected 
suppliers to recover in the aftermath of 
hurricanes harvey and irma.
