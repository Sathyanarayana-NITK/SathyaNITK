returns to shareholders
although long-term shareholder return remains the key
measure of our success, our share price performance
this year has not been strong. however, total shareholder return also includes the
dividend, and here the news for shareholders is
positive. the strong cash ﬂow generated by the group also
enabled us to begin a share buy back programme in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. your company believes this
is not in the interests of shareholders, customers or
employees, and will argue in favour of a strong and
integrated bt. &

bt group plc annual report and form 20-f 2004 bt is one of europe’s leading providers of telecommunications services. references to the ‘‘ﬁnancial year’’ are to the year ended 31 march of each year, eg the ‘‘2004 ﬁnancial year’’ refers to the year
ended 31 march 2004. unless otherwise stated, all non-ﬁnancial statistics are at 31 march 2004.
please see cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 141.
bt was incorporated in england and wales on 30 march 2001 as newgate telecommunications limited with the registered number
4190816. the company changed its name to bt group plc on 11 september 2001. following the demerger of mmo
2
in november
2001, the continuing activities of bt were transferred to bt group. bt group’s registered ofﬁce address is 81 newgate street, london ec1a 7aj. its principal activities include local, national and international
telecommunications services, higher-value broadband and internet
products and services, and it solutions. in the uk, bt serves over
20 million business and residential customers with more than 29 million
exchange lines, as well as providing network services to other operators. our business
your company continues to make progress by
innovating in our traditional markets and by growing
revenues in all the new wave markets – ict
(information and communications technology),
broadband, mobility and managed services – in which
we operate. as we move from a narrowband to a broadband
world, we are offering a new mix of products and
services in new markets – ict, broadband, mobility
and managed services. we continue to invest where we believe it
will make the greatest difference, while achieving
rigorous standards of cost efﬁciency and smarter
working practices. the review will cover, within the 21 key strategic
questions to be addressed, the possibility of the
structural separation of bt. our goal is to help everyone beneﬁt from
improved communications and to spread the beneﬁts
of new technology as widely as possible. strategic progress and outlook
the strong growth in new wave turnover, our ict order
book and broadband shows that our strategy is
working. new wave revenues
grew by 30% to £3,387 million. while continuing to
invest for the future, we generated free cash ﬂow of
over £2 billion and reduced net debt to £8.4 billion – a
reduction of two thirds on the level of three years ago. the full year dividend is 31% up on last year,
and over four times higher than two years ago. in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we reduced dissatisfaction by
22%. in this annual report, references to ‘‘bt group’’, ‘‘bt’’, ‘‘the group’’, ‘‘the company’’, ‘‘we’’ or ‘‘our’’ are to bt group plc (which
includes the continuing activities of british telecommunications plc) and its subsidiaries and lines of business, or any of them as the
context may require. changes in technology are leading to changes in
people’s behaviour. people are, for example, spending
more time on the internet and sending information by
e-mail, where once they would have used the phone or
fax. ‘‘technology substitution’’ is also having a
signiﬁcant impact in our traditional voice markets,
where ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice revenues were down in both
the consumer and business markets. in the consumer broadband market we’ve teamed
up with yahoo! british telecommunications plc is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of bt group plc and holds virtually all
businesses and assets of the bt group. lgt is a wireless telecommunications
service provider in the republic of korea. how bt operates
bt consists principally of three lines of business: bt
retail, bt wholesale and bt global services. wider responsibilities
it is important that companies such as bt live up to
their responsibilities in the wider communities in which
we operate. this is
demonstrated, for example, by our wide deployment of
broadband technology throughout the uk, and by the
bt education programme, which has enabled more
than two million young people to participate in a
drama-based campaign designed to help them improve
their communications skills. this transformation is putting converged services
at the heart of our offering, enabling our customers to
communicate wherever they happen to be. we offer our customers –
businesses and other large organisations, including
local and national government – the chance to enhance
their productivity, through expert management of their
information systems, desktop to desktop. contents
