“
the group made substantial 
financial progress, returning to 
strong overall organic revenue 
growth of 5%. although the company has not utilised the authority to buy 
back shares since 2008, the board believes it would be in the 
interests of all shareholders for the company to have the right 
to purchase its own shares in the market in the appropriate 
circumstances. our global risk & insurance businesses provide services including:

jlt is adversely affected by depressed insurance and 
reinsurance pricing levels as a significant proportion of our 
income is earned by way of commissions. fees and commissions
profit
remitted to shareholders reinvested in business
our business model
fees are typically charged either on a time-cost 
or a fixed-fee basis and are earned in each of the 
reinsurance, specialty and employee benefits 
divisions. these fees are paid by the client rather 
than the insurer or reinsurer. commissions are typically based on a percentage 
of the insurance or reinsurance premium being paid 
by the client. it also includes the 
chairman's statement, chief executive’s and 
finance director’s reviews as well as details 
of our markets, business model, strategic 
progress, operations and key risks. financial statements

programme
in 2017, jlt once again ran the international senior 
management programme (ismp) for some of our most promising 
leaders drawn from across the group. employees attending the 2017 ismp included: mark mcnulty, 
philip rong, luis ganoza, tyrone farinha, pedro farme, alok 
mathur, kevin rimmer, stuart winter, toby pollard, joe addison, 
david flandro, matthew bacon, collin yap, david smith, doris 
yung, colin daly, beatriz protasio, carrie o'neil, maurice gatto, 
toby sisson and lucas salcedo. our network is comprised of majority-owned and associate operations in all of the world's key 
economies, supplemented by non-owned partner operations. it includes 
an introduction to jlt with a review of 2017, 
including performance highlights, information 
on our colleagues, our culture and our mis-
sion, strategy and values. rigour
we work with integrity and discipline  
and stand up for what we believe in. agility
we think fast, move swiftly and  
act decisively. culture 
living a distinctive, 
entrepreneurial and client-
focused culture that attracts, 
develops and retains the  
best experts. our clients
our clients value our specialists who solve their complex risk 
challenges with creativity and collaboration. advice and consultancy
advice to our clients on their 
insurance and reinsurance 
programmes, ensuring that 
they understand the likelihood 
and potential severity of the 
risks they face, the options 
available to mitigate these 
risks and the potential cost  
of doing so. a further area of differentiation is jlt’s global service team 
hubs, multi-lingual groups that provide clients with a single  
point of contact, managing their global programmes via the  
jlt international network. in light of the investments being made 
and the preparatory work that has been 
undertaken, we do not anticipate that 
brexit will materially impact our ability to 
serve clients and access markets in the 
european union.
