we invest in developing our own 
pharmaceuticals products as well as 
seeking distribution partnerships and 
product acquisitions. we develop and sell goods and services 
to veterinary professionals for use in 
companion and production animals with 
direct sales in 7 countries europe. we have deliberately focused the 
development team on 17 active projects and we 
have a steady flow of products that are going 
through registration and are expected to launch 
in 2018 and 2019. 
summary and outlook
having brought together two highly 
complementary businesses, in particular with 
regard to our respective geographic markets, 
product portfolios and product development 
pipelines, we are growing a successful pan-
european animal health business. animalcare is a  
sustainable growing business  
in a growing market
and in a strong financial position to invest in future growth. npd 
projects have been prioritised to maximise return on investment. we have the 
opportunity to continue this growth through 
further strategic acquisitions, but also through 
organic growth focused on existing products 
and our product development pipeline, as well 
as the synergies and benefits of cross-selling 
which we expect to see impacting our q4 2018 
performance and more meaningfully in 2019. 
we believe we have created a platform for strong 
future growth and i look forward to updating on 
our progress. animalcare is  
cash generative
and given its strong balance sheet expects to maintain its current  
dividend policy whilst continuing to invest in new product development. the group 
invests significantly in its in-house development pipeline. { propose a total dividend of 6.7p, consistent with total dividends 
for the previous year ended 30
th
 june 2017.

financial performance
 { revenue growth of 22.4% at aer (9.6% on a proforma basis) with 
strong growth in companian animals and production animals. { integration is wide-ranging and in progress, with priority focus on 
supply chain, systems (hr & it) and product development. 14 26011   18/05/2018   proof 4
a project rationalisation and prioritisation process for all projects 
across the group has been undertaken. within the context of 
the enlarged group, technical feasibility, development costs 
and commercial forecasts have been reviewed thoroughly to 
determine which projects would be continued. one centralised registration was submitted in 2017 and launch 
of this product is planned in late 2018. progress of the pipeline 
continues and in 2018 three new products have already been 
registered across europe with additional submissions planned 
throughout the year. during the period we have seen the first result of this strategy 
with an agreement with us-based nutramax, to provide europe-
wide distribution of their nutritional supplement cosequin, which 
promotes canine joint health. animalcare group plc is a uk aim listed 
veterinary sales, marketing and product 
development company resulting from the 
integration of animalcare and ecuphar. our vision is to become a 
leading pan-european veterinary 
pharmaceutical business. overview
products are supplied to animal health professionals both 
directly or through national distribution networks and fall 
into two categories: regulated pharmaceuticals and over 
the counter products. the portfolio is very broad with over 300 products including 
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biocides and nutraceuticals. board
following the acquisition, the executive directors 
comprised chris cardon, who took on the role of 
chief executive officer for the enlarged group, 
supported by iain menneer as chief operating 
officer and walter beyers as chief financial 
officer. in september 2017 chris brewster, who 
at the time of the acquisition stood down as a 
board director but remained within the business, 
was reappointed to the board as chief financial 
officer, replacing walter beyers who resigned  
to pursue other interests. more recently iain 
menneer stood down as chief operating officer. “ t h e key 
aim for our 
business is to 
create a cash- 
generative, 
growing pan-
european 
animal health 
company”
