build on our experience
in the emerging prs market, our  
105-year history as a leading, responsible 
and professional landlord sets us apart 
and underpins our growth plans. our development team, working 
alongside our operations team, has 
created thoughtfully considered, 
well-designed homes, perfectly 
positioned for the local market. encouraging our staff to 
support our investment pipeline
in the past year, one of our 
apprentices brought a prs 
investment opportunity to  
our sourcing meeting, and  
we successfully acquired it. using first-hand knowledge and 
customer research to inform 
the design of our buildings
at one of our new prs 
developments, argo apartments 
in canning town, we have applied 
some new features, including a 
guest suite, and made a number  
of adjustments to our operational 
approach, using customer 
feedback and market research, 
including consumer focus groups. using our in-house 
knowledge and expertise, combined 
with rigorous research and analysis, 
we choose assets located in the areas 
of greatest demand with the greatest 
growth prospects. we have a strong capital structure, which 
enables us to deploy capital efficiently. relationships
building and maintaining strong 
relationships with our customers, 
partners, suppliers, shareholders, 
local communities, government and 
within our industry is an important 
ingredient to enabling our success. intellectual property 
in an emerging market such as the prs, 
where we are market leader, we focus 
on protecting our intellectual property 
and internal market intelligence, to 
ensure we continue to maintain our 
lead and grow our market share. contents

regulated tenancy portfolio
our portfolio of regulated tenancies 
generates stable and reliable cash flow 
of at least £100m per annum. we own and manage 
over 8,900 homes for rent  
across the uk. creating 104 new homes  
for rent 
in hampshire, at our berewood 
project, we are creating 104 new 
high-quality homes for rent. • demand for homes in major cities will 
continue to grow. • renting will continue to be more popular 
in urban areas and commuter zones. we have a twice-weekly investment committee chaired by our  
chief executive, helen gordon. baroness margaret ford stepped down in february 
having served eight years as a non-executive director with the 
last two as chairman. nick jopling, grainger’s property director, 
stepped down in september having been with the company for 
seven years. belinda richards has decided to step down at the 
agm in 2018 having served over six years on the board as a 
non-executive director. we are changing the uk  
housing market for the better, 
creating attractive, high-quality 
professionalised rental homes, 
and we are focused on providing 
our customers with great, reliable 
service and a place they can  
call home. our operational 
platform ensures we have a direct 
relationship with our customers and 
enables us to deliver enhanced returns. our aim is to offer attractive homes to our 
customers and provide a reliable service 
for them. technology
we continue to enhance our use of 
technology to improve service, knowledge 
and operational efficiency. the opportunity for growth in  
the uk’s private rented sector  
is substantial, and we aim to be  
the uk’s leading landlord – for  
the benefit of our customers  
and our shareholders. business overview
we are investing successfully in new 
high-quality homes for rent, generating 
attractive and sustainable total returns 
for our shareholders. the assets within our portfolio are well 
located and achieve market-leading 
performance. these 
well-located assets are attractive to 
customers and, with our expert 
operational team managing the  
properties directly, our portfolio  
continues to outperform the market. this is supported 
by the reliable revenue generated from 
our regulated tenancy portfolio. we have a high-performing portfolio 
of residential rental properties, which 
provides both strong capital growth and 
rental growth prospects. returns from regulated tenancies are 
generated in three ways: rental income, 
capital growth and the reversionary 
surplus (crystallising the reversion when 
they become vacant). our regulated 
tenancy portfolio provides a resilient 
rental income with growth linked to the 
retail price index, albeit with lower yields 
than our prs assets. 6
a positive political  
landscape and policy 
environment
• positive moves by the uk government to 
support growth in the prs and build-to-rent 
sector, including the housing white paper. • positive changes to london planning policy 
by the london mayor. • increasing support at local government level. • a comprehensive programme of 
engagement with central government,  
the london mayoral team and local 
government.
