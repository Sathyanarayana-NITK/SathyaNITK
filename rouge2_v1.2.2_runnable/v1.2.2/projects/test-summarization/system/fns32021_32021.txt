financial highlights
1.  profit before net finance costs, any profit or loss on the disposal of properties, investment property fair value movements and exceptional items. the number  
of shares in issue excludes those held by the company and not allocated to the employees under the share incentive plan, which are treated  
as cancelled. the final dividend will be paid on 
13 october 2017 to shareholders on  
the register at the close of business  
on 29 september 2017.
this level of dividend cover is consistent 
with the policy stated at the time of our 
share capital reorganisation in 2014. 
since then the total annual dividend  
paid to shareholders has increased  
from £3.2m to £4.2m. net debt has consequently increased 
from £60.1m at june 2016 to £78.1m  
at june 2017. 
board of directors
following the review of our strategy  
for brewing and brands as set out in  
the chief executive’s report, and as  
part of the transition from brewing asahi 
super dry, the role of brewing and 
brands director is no longer required. 3.  net assets at the balance sheet date divided by the number of shares in issue being 14,857,500 50p shares. within this sum, £24.8m was invested  
in the acquisition of ues, eight pubs  
from ei group plc and five pubs in the 
acquisition of vgr in november 2016. 
we realised proceeds from property 
sales of £5.9m (2016: £11.9m). in 2017 we have paid £28.7m  
in excise duty alone. our strategy   |strategicreport |  governance |  financial statements |  other information

 shepherd 
neame
an independent family business  
britain’s oldest brewer 
our vision
to be a great british brewer and run the best pubs. we acquired village green restaurants limited,  
consisting of five popular pub restaurants in mid-kent. we have invested £1m redeveloping the minnis b ay bar  
and brasserie, birchington, expanding the trading area  
and improving the function facilities. we have carried out major redevelopments at a number  
of tenanted pubs, including the old house at home, 
dormansland. this year has been notable for a strong 
underlying performance, some excellent 
work to enhance our own brand 
portfolio, important steps to modernise 
the brewing operation and a period of 
significant investment with the 
acquisition of 14 new pubs. these characteristics deliver a strong and 
sustainable business for the long-term 
benefit of shareholders. graeme has made a 
considerable contribution to the business 
since joining in 2006. he has greatly 
developed and enhanced the brand 
portfolio, and consolidated the sales, 
marketing and production activities into 
a single brewing and brands division. the board is focussed on 
investing for the long-term benefit of 
shareholders in line with our aims to be a 
great british brewer and to run the best 
pubs. our mission
to give our customers a great and memorable  
experience to make for a better day! the performance has been good in all 
operating divisions in the company and 
excellent progress has been made 
against our strategic objectives. i have been particularly impressed by the 
pace of change in the business in recent 
years as the team modernise the pubs 
and brands portfolio and innovate to 
address the continuous challenge to 
enhance the customer experience. the core strengths of shepherd neame  
lie in a strong sense of family, a distinct 
individual character, and a passion for 
quality, for high standards and for  
making continuous improvements  
within a consistent strategic framework. we are streamlining our management 
roles in this area. we believe that effective operation 
of the voluntary code will make extension  
of the statutory code unlikely. we are taking appropriate 
action to streamline our management 
structure, reduce our overheads and 
operating costs accordingly. in the previous financial year 
exceptional costs of £0.2m were 
incurred for legal and professional 
fees relating to the company’s 
accounting transition to frs 102 and 
regulatory transition to the financial 
conduct authority regime.
