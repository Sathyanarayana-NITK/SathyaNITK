the steel 
manufacturing 
process
steel manufacturing is a 
highly demanding process 
for which consistent quality 
and efﬁ cient production is 
essential. steel production volumes 
are the critical driver of 
demand as the steel 
division primarily sells products 
that are consumed during 
the steel making process. this is particularly true in the 
production of higher-quality 
steels where our highly 
technical products deliver 
the most value. the advanced refractories 
business also supplies 
other high-temperature 
industries such as primary 
aluminium, copper, cement, 
petrochemical and energy 
from waste. annual report and accounts 201 7

 “i joined vesuvius in 
brazil as part of 
project columbus”
building on my degree in chemical 
engineering and several industry 
internships, i joined vesuvius in brazil 
in 2013, as part of project columbus, 
the group’s international graduate 
programme. i always wanted to work 
overseas since ﬁ rst starting college, 
and was excited to start my nine-
month international assignment. 1 m

12 business model
the strategic report set out on pages 1 to 73 
contains a fair review of our businesses, strategy, 
and business model and the associated principal 
risks and uncertainties. after initial training at home in brazil, 
i moved to india where over the 
course of my nine month secondment, 
i developed three projects, focusing 
on resin production and machine 
maintenance at foseco in pune, 
and on viso production in vesuvius 
calcutta . having enjoyed the challenge of 
working abroad, i then moved to 
germany as a production manager 
assistant at the newly acquired 
mould powder plant in mülheim. our goal is to create 
value for our customers, using our expertise to improve the 
safety and efﬁ ciency of their manufacturing processes, 
enhance their end product quality and reduce their costs. this enabled me to apply 
my interest and expertise in process 
management and optimisation. i have achieved a lot in my ﬁ rst ﬁ ve 
years at vesuvius, developing technical 
skills, growing in experience and 
expanding my language capabilities 
and geographical horizons. our products, 
systems and solutions 
enable this through every 
part of the process. by their nature, these statements involve uncertainty and are based on assumptions and involve risks, 
uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from 
those anticipated. the forward-looking statements reﬂ ect knowledge and information available at the date 
of preparation of this annual report and, other than in accordance with its legal and regulatory obligations, 
the company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. nothing in this annual 
report should be construed as a proﬁ t forecast. 1. underlying basis is at constant currency and excludes separately reported items and the impact of acquisitions 
and disposals. these help our customers increase 
their efﬁ ciency and productivity , enhance 
quality , improve safety and reduce their 
costs and their environmental impact. as developing countries move 
from infrastructure-based 
economies to consumer -based 
economies, the ratio of ﬂ at 
to long steel consumption 
also transitions. demand in the majority of 
the remaining casting 
end-markets is driven by the 
cost of capital and the level 
of current proﬁ tability in the 
given sector. environmental 
regulations, driven by the 
desire to reduce volatile 
organic compound emissions 
and the use of silica within the 
industry, are also expected to 
continue to tighten. 9m

provide our shareholders with a superior return on their investment, 
whilst providing each of our employees with a safe workplace 
where he or she is recognised, developed and properly rewarded. details of our principles, our people 
and community engagement, together with 
our focus on safety, are also contained in the 
strategic report. it also gave me the opportunity to 
immerse myself in a culturally very 
different operation. whilst there, i worked on the 
optimisation of spraying processes, 
improved packaging standards and 
implemented other safety standards

our markets
steel 
customers of the steel division 
are principally steel producers 
and manufacturers of steel 
production equipment. vesuvius’ engineered 
refractories prevent the build-
up of impurities in the steel, 
protect the molten metal from 
oxidisation, moderate its ﬂ ow, 
and manage its ﬂ uid dynamics 
to harmonise consistency and 
reduce the pick-up of inclusions.
