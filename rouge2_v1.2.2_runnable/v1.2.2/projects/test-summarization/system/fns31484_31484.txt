what changes have you seen? what role has the board played in gap? how does this carry over to 2018 and beyond? it is a significant moment for the group, and a natural time to  
look back at the past four years, as well as to look forward  
to the future possibilities created by gap. few trends will be bigger in 2018 and the coming years than  
the transformation of tv and video by the delivery of services 
“over the top” of the internet. netflix, amazon video, youtube  
and other online-only services will account for 18% of total paid  
and ad-supported tv and video revenues next year and 60%  
of growth. a meaningful number of households  
in the country are cutting the cord by cancelling their pay tv 
contracts, tired of paying for bundles including hundreds of  
tv channels they never watch. ovum data shows that pay tv 
subscription numbers began to decline from a high of 100.8 
million at the end of 2013 and will fall to 95.8 million by 2022. the 
creation of new households uninterested in subscribing in the  
first place, known as cord-nevers, means pay tv’s penetration of 
households will fall nearly 10 percentage points to 71.9% in 2022.
a growing number of consumers will opt to use lower-priced, 
online-only services instead. performance and possibilities   annual report and financial statements 2017

group chief executive’s review
t
his year’s report marks the completion of another 
positive financial period for the informa group,  
and the conclusion of the group’s four-year 
programme of measured change, strengthened 
capabilities and performance improvement through 
the 2014-2017 growth acceleration plan (gap). what we do
the group serves commercial, 
professional and academic 
communities by helping them 
connect and learn, and by creating 
and providing access to content  
and intelligence that help people  
and businesses work smarter and 
make better decisions faster. investment, expansion and the integration 
of penton information services
significant capital has also been invested inside and outside the 
group. internally, this has included around £80m on improving 
systems and technology capabilities, enhancing customer 
platforms and supporting innovation to bring new products to life. externally, the group has pursued a targeted and disciplined 
acquisition strategy, building scale in the us and a leading 
position in b2b events, most significantly through adding penton 
in late 2016. the effective integration of penton has been a major 
focus for management in 2017 to ensure the group makes the 
most of future opportunities created by the combination. why? why? so what matters? in november, we completed the sale of a majority stake in 
euroforum, our german and swiss conference business, further 
increasing the focus on our major brands in core verticals. over the last four years, around £80m has been invested  
in a range of projects in all four operating divisions, as well as 
centrally in global support. the number of 
reviewers for new drug approvals in china is now 600 from just 
60 a few years ago, with plans to have 1,600 within a year. china’s food and drug administration has ambitions to be as 
significant as its us, european and japanese counterparts. it continued through proactive portfolio management, exiting 
businesses and markets that were not core or where we were 
sub-scale, and expanding in geographies and verticals where the 
growth opportunities were most attractive, particularly in the us. this has been matched by significant external investment through 
the targeted addition of businesses, helping informa to expand 
internationally, strengthen its position in key industry verticals  
and broaden its range of b2b capabilities. this business is now more focused on customers and markets, 
with strength in subscriptions supported by a revitalised consulting 
business and an exciting marketing services capability through 
informa engage. pace and progress
the speed of combination varied by workstream, with 
priority given to the integration of key brands into vertical 
portfolios to allow commercial teams to quickly identify 
and seize revenue opportunities. * 2014-2016 figures reflect previous measure of organic growth. the year 
also saw the group fulfil its ambition to return all four operating 
divisions to positive underlying revenue growth. these results are built on the foundations of the previous four 
years, and the measures taken under gap to increase the 
group’s focus on customers and vertical industries, build market 
positions and strengthen overall operational capabilities. reach and depth in international verticals 
through these measures and more, the group has positioned 
itself to take advantage of growth in its end markets. this started with talent and experience, including appointing  
new divisional ceos and a dedicated cto in each division. the approach for 2018 and beyond is led by this ambition, and 
this is why the directors fully support the group’s recommended 
offer for ubm plc, formally announced on 30 january 2018, to 
create a leading b2b information services group. these decisions and actions have been taken with a view to 
creating value for shareholders and our wider stakeholders. governing the group’s performance  
and growth 
your board will continue to oversee, support and challenge, 
where appropriate, management’s plans for 2018. 
we are pleased to recognise our responsibilities to ensure  
the group grows and operates in a way that benefits wider 
stakeholders.
