the delivery of our products and services is made 
possible by our people, who are at the heart of our 
business and are the bedrock of our success. ricardo’s 
community is bound together and driven by our 
corporate values of respect, integrity, innovation,  
and passion. these results 
are positive in the context of an uncertain political 
and economic climate experienced in the year, 
together with the changes within the automotive 
industry, as many of our customers plan for an 
increasingly electrified future. it is 
through the implementation of this strategy in recent 
years that the group has been able to deliver these 
results, with strong performance from our rail and 
environmental consultancy businesses, together 
with our performance products business. financial highlights

our market sectors
our strategy of diversification into adjacent market 
sectors continues to provide balance to our order intake. as set out in more detail in the chief executive’s 
statement on pages 8 to 10 and the financial review 
on pages 26 to 29, the group has delivered a resilient 
set of results with marginal growth in underlying 
profit before tax and earnings per share. the group’s performance 
against its strategic objectives is outlined on pages 14 
and 15. we also continued to invest in research and 
development (as described on pages 24 and 25), our 
people and our facilities. we also manufacture and assemble niche, high-quality 
and high-performance products. these, together with the additional 
pressure brought by the intense diesel debate in 
the automotive industry, has led to an increased 
impetus around long-term electrification of vehicles, 
a short-term improvement of combustion engine 
performance and new ways of vehicle operation to 
enhance efficiency such as driverless or autonomous 
vehicles. as the pace in 
electrification and autonomous vehicles increases 
(across all forms of transportation), we will continue 
to be ready and will match our offerings and our 
asset base to the requirements of our customers. ricardo is spearheading research into 
the measurement and control technologies, 
working with industry bodies and the european 
commission;
• charge of innovation: one of the major 
challenges holding back the market penetration 
of battery electric vehicles (‘bevs’) is the high cost 
of rechargeable energy storage. 2014 2013 2015 2016 2017

our customers
our order intake arises from a client list that includes the 
world’s major transportation original equipment manufacturers 
and operators, supply chain organisations, energy companies, 
financial institutions and government agencies. in addition, ricardo performance products has been 
nominated by aston martin to design, develop and 
supply an advanced transmission for the ground-
breaking valkyrie hypercar, which is being created 
as a result of a unique collaboration between aston 
martin and red bull advanced technologies. the group continues to pursue its strategic 
objectives through organic growth and carefully 
targeted acquisitions. it is the commitment of our 
employees that enables us to deliver these results and 
which underpins our reputation with clients. corporate governance
the board firmly believes that robust corporate 
governance and risk management are essential to 
maintain the stability of the group and its financial 
health. outlook
the ricardo strategy is underpinned by trends which 
will affect an ever-increasing number of people 
around the globe; with a growing population, mass 
urbanisation, poorer air quality, climate change, 
stringent emissions legislation and resource scarcity.
