** excludes acquisition costs, standfast flood-related costs and restructuring and 
reorganisation costs. the results include £2.8 
million as a result of interim insurance payments for loss of profits. to date, the group has received a total of £16.9 million of flood-related 
insurance payments in respect of damage to business assets, 
reimbursement of cleaning costs and loss of profits. the impact of this has been mitigated by insurance 
reimbursement. it also reflects an initial contribution from the acquisition in october 
2016 of clarke & clarke, a fabrics and wallcoverings business with two 
international brands, clarke & clarke and studio g. this acquisition 
continues to trade in line with the board’s expectations and is expected 
to make a material contribution to earnings during the current financial 
year ending 31 january 2018. we continue to seek further acquisitions 
to complement our organic growth initiatives. we were very pleased with the support from both new and existing 
investors for the equity fundraising of £17.0 million as part-funding for 
the acquisition of clarke & clarke. the reported 
financial results include a first-time contribution from clarke & clarke  
of £1.0 million. we have been pleased with the performance of our woodland walk 
collection from sanderson, which has been its best-selling collection for 
several years, and the success of morris & co. pure, a range of classic 
william morris designs produced for the first time in neutral colours. overseas brand sales were up 10.0% in 
reportable currency, up 0.5% in constant currency. sales in the us, the 
group’s second largest market, were up 8.3% in reportable currency, 
down 5.2% in constant currency. sales in the 
rest of the world grew 0.3% in constant currency. we are particularly pleased with licensing income of £2.6 million, which 
was up 25.6% in reportable currency, up 13.1 % in constant currency. the group’s results were impacted by the flood in december 2015 at 
standfast & barracks, though the financial impact has been mitigated 
by the group’s comprehensive insurance policy. as previously 
announced, we will be seeking to negotiate a final settlement of the 
insurance claim with our insurers and anticipate that a settlement will 
be agreed in the first half of the current financial year. summary
despite the significant challenges faced as a result of the flood in 2015, 
i am pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in our brands 
both in the uk and internationally. page 16

harlequin remains the uk’s leading mid-market contemporary brand. sanderson’s woodland walk collection has 
been the brand’s best-selling collection for several years now and has 
been universally appreciated as quintessential sanderson. this collection 
interprets william morris’ iconic designs in a new neutral colour palette. walker greenbank’s vertically integrated high-quality uk 
manufacturing base, comprising our loughborough-based wallpaper 
printing business, anstey wallpaper company, and lancaster-based 
fabric printing business standfast & barracks, differentiates us from 
others in our industry. fiona brings a 
wealth of brand, digital and multi-channel retail experience to the 
company. this cutting edge, accessibly priced brand continues to be a success 
with young, aspirational and fashion-aware customers. scion has also 
quickly become established as a valuable brand for licensing partners 
where the contemporary and graphic nature of the designs translates 
particularly well. walker greenbank plc

7.2% and were particularly impacted by the flood at standfast & 
barracks. the flood halted production at standfast & barracks for a period of 16 
weeks, thereby removing the group’s internal capacity to print fabric for 
its own brands and third party customers. full production was restored 
in october 2016 and the brands were fully restocked by the financial 
year end. like-for-like sales are down due 
to the flood. the insurance-funded replacement of 
flood-damaged printing equipment means that the factory is now 
operating with the latest machinery, increasing our production capacity 
and capabilities.
