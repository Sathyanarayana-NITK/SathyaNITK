look-and-feel now right across our estate. id mobile operations in the uk continue to grow from

us to offer highly differentiated propositions to customers, 
supported by an innovative it platform, enabling us to tailor 
plans, for example, with the ability to transfer data between 
friends and family, as well as being at the vanguard of 
free roaming. this has 
focused initially on phone and white goods repairs and 
nps levels have been very encouraging indeed. we have also improved 
our online capabilities, particularly with a new carphone 
warehouse web platform and we have experienced strong 
online sales growth across all our brands. we continue to gain market share across our businesses. we are market 
leaders in our key markets. this sales growth was driven 
in large part by growth in electricals in a flat overall market. we are seeing the upside of these efforts now as

*  see glossary for definition of terms including headline performance measures. a particular mention should be made of kotsovolos in 
greece which further enhanced its position as market leader 
with 3ppts market share growth against a clearly difficult 
economic environment. our relationship with 
our key stakeholders and the way we manage the business 
in a sustainable manner are set out in our corporate 
responsibility statement on pages 28 to 35. we believe 
that our unique expertise in technology can be used to 
help tackle social issues and we are hugely supportive 
of our colleagues’ roles in contributing to good causes. the future holds many opportunities and a few challenges 
and uncertainties. at the same time, it is pleasing to see – across the group 
– sustained high levels of customer satisfaction and net 
promoter scores driven by our continued relentless focus 
on improving our proposition for our customers. we are 
excited about our plans in services and about the myriad of initiatives that will drive long-
term relationships with our customers. it distributes across the nordics 
and we expect to see benefits in stock availability and 
efficiency. customers will choose and buy through a mix of online 
and offline. price competitiveness continues to be an area of real focus; 
our customers are – rightly – savvy, and we need to be both 
competitive and transparent - not only on the products 
themselves, but also on the cost and availability of delivery 
and services. more 
importantly, the improvement in our cost base, the strong leadership position that we 
have built, the investment that we have made in our digital business and, above all, the 
enormous shift in customer satisfaction and price competitiveness that we have driven 
leave us well positioned to flourish in the years ahead. while the uk consumer environment seems to be holding up for us, there will 
undoubtedly continue to be changes in the way people buy all of the products that we 
sell from phones to washing machines. change always represents opportunity, and our 
job is to find the propositions that keep us compelling to our customers forever. such statements are based on current expectations and 
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any expected future events or results 
referred to in these forward looking statements. in short, it has been a good year for dixons carphone and it gives me great pleasure 
once again to thank my 43,000 colleagues for the work that they have done to deliver so 
well and so energetically for our customers.”

cautionary statement
certain statements made in this annual report and accounts are forward looking. it is great to be back at a business i served for 
more than a decade. importantly, i would like to pay tribute to the 
achievements of my predecessor, sir charles dunstone, one of the uk’s 
great entrepreneurs, who founded half of this business that has gone on 
to be one of the world’s major retailers, serving millions of customers 
every year in 10 countries and employing more than 43,000 people. dixons carphone is proud to be a founding partner of 
heads together, which seeks to support those with mental 
health issues.
