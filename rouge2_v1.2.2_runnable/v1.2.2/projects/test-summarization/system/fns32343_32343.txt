our story
we own, create and build 
desirable real estate  
that meets occupiers’  
demands in a rapidly  
evolving retail environment. management reviews the performance of the business 
principally on a proportionately consolidated basis which 
includes the group’s share of joint ventures on a line by line 
basis. the key ﬁnancial performance indicators are also 
presented on this basis. alternative performance measures are ﬁnancial measures 
which are not speciﬁed under ifrs but are used by 
management as they highlight the underlying recurring 
performance of the group’s property rental business and are 
based on the epra best practice recommendations (bpr) 
reporting framework which is widely recognised and used 
by public real estate companies. our strong retailer relationships 
shape our decision making. our strong retailer relationships

shape our decision making. our sector leading portfolio 
metrics have been maintained thanks 
to our strong occupier and property 
relationships. the real 
estate sector is not immune. this demonstrates not only the 
attractive dynamics of our buildings but 
increasingly the growing importance 
that occupiers are putting on logistics 
and fulﬁlment. structural changes impacting 
shopping habits and 
occupier demand

portfolio overview
total valuation £1,534 million
a portfolio focused on retailer-led distribution
we specialise in retailer-led distribution, out of town and 
convenience retail with a focus on strong income and 
adding value through asset management initiatives and 
short-cycle development opportunities. the sector is beneﬁting 
strongly from structural support as 
uk consumers continue to migrate 
to online. conversely, physical retail 
continues to face signiﬁcant challenges 
from this online shift with the inevitable 
space overcapacity this brings to the 
retail market. this ongoing structural demand for 
distribution and lack of meaningful 
supply has given us the conﬁdence 
to increase our investment across 
all distribution sub-sectors of mega 
box, regional and urban logistics. not only are we living in a low growth, 
low interest rate environment but ageing 
demographics are accentuating the 
search for income and alternatives 
to low yielding government bonds. our signiﬁcant and increasing 
investment in distribution is delivering 
excellent returns, sustainable income 
growth and long term value for our 
shareholders. we will continue to build the 
foundations for future dividend 
progression. distribution weighting

income growth with 
structural support
we continue to live in a world 
characterised by both political and 
economic uncertainty. chairman’s statement
whilst political and economic 
uncertainty was a signiﬁcant distraction 
for the markets in the year, the attraction 
of secure income continued to grow. this need has already risen substantially 
and will grow further in the years 
to come. high quality companies 
offering well-covered and growing 
dividends ought to become ever 
more highly prized. we continue to see good investment 
and short cycle development 
opportunities, particularly in urban 
logistics, and we have now fully 
committed the proceeds of our recent 
equity placing into sensible, accretive 
assets. we have 12 million 
sq ft under management and a high proportion of our 
portfolio is invested in retailer-led distribution. our distribution exposure is 
expected to exceed 70% within the 
current ﬁnancial year. dividend per share

mid size units between 
100,000 sq ft and 500,000 sq ft

urban logistics 
smaller logistics units allowing 
the ﬁnal journey of delivery. new lettings achieved an average 
lease length of 18.2 years, helped 
by new leases to amazon, michelin 
and eddie stobart. urban logistics is an essential part 
of modern distribution and enables 
the retailer and parcel operator to 
get closer to its point of delivery and 
fulﬁl orders quickly. the functionality of urban logistics 
has evolved from a location which 
previously stored products to an 
operation today that is designed 
to maximise speed of delivery. over the last four years, 
through management activity, our 
occupancy level has been above 
99% and our unexpired lease term has 
remained at 12.8 years with only 1% of 
our leases due to expire within the next 
three years. our predictable, repetitive and growing 
income streams have allowed us to 
progress the dividend again this year by 
3.4%. an attractive dividend needs to 
be adequately covered by operating 
earnings and i’m pleased that we have 
maintained the 1.1x dividend cover we 
achieved last year. they must generate 
income in excess of our dividend and have 
a higher value in ﬁve years’ time.
