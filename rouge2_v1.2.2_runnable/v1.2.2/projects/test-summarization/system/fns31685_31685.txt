the directors at the date of this report, all of whom served throughout the year, are shown on page 9. 
the director retiring by rotation is mr a.r. heller and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. mr a.r. our values
>  
we believe in conducting our business 
activities with integrity, building mutually 
beneficial long-term relationships with all  
our customers, providing the highest levels  
of professional service at every stage. >  
we are committed to delivering superior 
value in our products and services to our 
customers, on a continuing basis. as management exercised tight control 
to maintain overheads at similar levels to 
the previous year, the increase in sales had 
a significant impact on operating profit. as 
previously reported, uncertainty over the 
pension scheme valuation since march 2017 
has impacted on the strategic review process 
and caused it to take longer than originally 
expected. this matter is explained further in 
the chief executive’s statement. should the strategic 
review process not result in an acceptable 
offer being made for the company, the 
board confirms that it intends to consider 
returning an amount of cash to shareholders 
subject to any constraints on distributable 
reserves and the rules of the takeover code. the 
company will update shareholders further 
when it is in a position to do so. the directors consider that it would be advantageous for the company to be in a position to purchase its own ordinary shares. annual report and accounts

chairman’s statement
sir michael heller
turnover for the year to 30 september 2017 
was £5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the previous year, an increase of 3%. this profit measure, 
which excludes non-cash ifrs items and 
exceptional non-trading costs, is reconciled 
to statutory operating profit in note 4 to 
the consolidated financial statements. last year’s result included one-off 
property costs of £104,000 relating to a 
property that we have now sold. these include erp solutions for the 
merchanting/wholesale distribution industry, 
e-business, application hosting and sales 
intelligence solutions together with 
a comprehensive range of customer 
support and education services. >  
we respect the individuality of each member 
of our staff, fostering an environment where 
creativity and productivity are encouraged, 
valued and rewarded. >  
we are dedicated to creating value for 
shareholders by performing in a manner 
which will enhance return on investment. however, it should be noted that the 
improvement in the group’s net asset 
position referred to above positively 
impacts our distributable reserves. at the 
half-year stage, we reported that sales activity 
had improved modestly compared to the 
previous year and that continued into the 
second half in spite of a challenging market. adjusted operating profit was £540,000, 
compared with £430,000 last year, an 
increase of 26%. statutory pre-tax profit for the year also 
increased to £417,000 compared with 
£244,000 the prior year, an increase of 
71%. at the year end our cash balances were 
£6.4 million compared with £5.4 million last 
year. r&d cash expenditure for the year was 
£901,000 (2016: £982,000) and was 
principally focussed on continued 
enhancements to our key products, 
quantum vs and vecta. operating cash flows were £580,000 
(2016: £818,000) and dividends paid 
amounted to £635,000 (2016: £631,000). during the year to 30 september 2017 
our r&d expenditure was £901,000 
(2016: £982,000). statutory pre-tax profit was 
£417,000 (2016: £244,000). i would like to thank all our members 
of staff and my colleagues on the board 
for their contribution during the year. this figure includes three executive and two non-executive directors, 
all of whom are male. there are five senior managers, four of whom are male and one female. board structure and meetings
during the year under review the board of directors comprised three executive directors and two non-executive directors.
