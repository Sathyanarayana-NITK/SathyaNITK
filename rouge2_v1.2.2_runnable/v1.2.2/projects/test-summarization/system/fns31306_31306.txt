cash and cash equivalents of $14.2 million and other short-term investments of $16.0 million at 31 december

2018 of $20.3 million, held as $13.5 million equivalent in ukrainian hryvnia and the balance of $6.8 million 
equivalent predominantly in us dollars and pounds sterling. this compares with an 
aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at 
the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65% 
over the year. as regards the group’s financial performance in the year 
ended 31 december 2017, i am pleased to report that 
the group made a profit of $2.3 million (2016: $1.3 million 
loss), mainly as a result of improved revenues from higher 
production volumes and hydrocarbon prices. cash generated 
from operations during the year was higher at $18.0 million 
(2016: $10.0 million). nevertheless, there continue to be stresses in the economy 
and weaknesses in the ukrainian banking sector. outlook
while there are still challenges in the business environment in 
ukraine, the situation is improving and the group is continuing 
to progress the development of its ukrainian fields. operations
the improving geopolitical situation in ukraine, coupled with 
the stabilisation of the ukrainian hryvnia, higher hydrocarbon 
prices and improvements in the fiscal and economic situation 
over the last year, meant that the group was able to increase 
the development programmes at its ukrainian fields during 
2017.
at the mex-gol and sv fields, the group continued to work 
with p .d.f. these measures, and the general improvement in the business 
climate in ukraine, are encouraging and supportive of the 
independent oil and gas producers in ukraine. the group’s other short-term investments at 
28 march 2018 were $16.0 million
outlook
focus during 2018 at mex-gol and sv fields on completion of geophysical studies on existing seismic

additional compression equipment, continued investment in gas processing facilities and pipeline network, and 
upgrading of existing wells

chairman’s statement
i am pleased to introduce the 2017 annual report and 
financial statements. at the group’s mex-gol and sv fields, production was 
reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in june 
2017, the new mex-109 well, utilising improved drilling 
and completion techniques developed as a result of recent 
studies, was completed successfully and put on production, 
and in august 2017, following completion of its workover, 
the sv-2 well was also put on production. in addition, the vas field has continued to 
produce consistently during the year. limited’s comprehensive re-evaluation study to plan 
additional development of these fields. board and management changes
during the year, there were significant changes to the 
management and board of directors of the company. on behalf of the board,  
i would like to thank each of keith, alastair and adrian for 
their valued contributions during their respective tenures with 
the company. in conclusion, on behalf of the board, i would like to thank all 
of our staff for the continued dedication and support they have 
shown during the year. the group reports safety and 
environmental performance in accordance with industry 
practice and guidelines. mr hopkinson is 
a member of the society of petroleum engineers, and holds a 
bsc (hons) in applied physics from st andrews university. he also 
has extensive teaching and academic research experience 
working at wayne state and michigan state universities. mr 
glazunov is a chartered financial analyst and holds an msc 
in mathematics from kiev state university, an msc in statistics 
from michigan state university and an mba from wayne state 
university. he is a member 
of the institute of chartered accountants of australia & new 
zealand, and holds a bsc honours from canterbury university 
(new zealand) and a diploma in accounting from victoria 
university (new zealand). through strict 
enforcement of the group’s hses management system, 
together with regular management meetings, training and the 
appointment of dedicated safety professionals, the group 
strives to ensure that the impact of its business activities 
on its staff, contractors and the environment is as low as 
is reasonably practicable. this methodology highlights external, operational and technical, financial and corporate risks and assesses the level of risk and 
potential consequences. these measures are designed to spread 
the risks associated with each bank’s creditworthiness, 
and the group endeavours to use banks that have the best 
available creditworthiness. whilst not materially affecting the group’s production 
operations, the instability has disrupted the group’s 
development and operational planning for its assets. with 
effect from the start of august 2017, sergii glazunov became 
chief executive officer, having previously been finance 
director, and yevhen (gene) palyenka was appointed chief 
financial officer. later in august 2017, bruce burrows joined 
the board as non-executive director, and adrian coates 
stepped down from the board at the same time. i joined the board as non-executive director in september 
2017, and was appointed non-executive chairman in october 
2017. at the same time, phil frank joined the board as non-
executive director, and keith henry and alastair graham 
stepped down from the board. by order of the board

chris hopkinson
non-executive chairman
chris hopkinson was appointed as non-executive director 
in september 2017, and became non-executive chairman in 
october 2017. mr hopkinson has extensive experience in the 
oil and gas industry, having worked in senior management roles 
in kazakhstan, africa, the russian federation and the middle 
east. the 
well was drilled to a depth of 4,873 metres, and completed 
in the b-20 visean reservoir. the well is designed to 
appraise horizons in the visean formation, and to evaluate the 
western edge of field, at an offset of approximately 1 km from 
the nearest currently producing well. the production licences extend over a combined area of 269 km², approximately 
200 km east of kiev. the fields are located, geologically, towards the middle of the dnieper-donets sedimentary basin which extends across the 
majority of north-east ukraine. during 2017, the group has made very 
promising progress in the development of its mex-gol, sv 
and vas gas and condensate fields in north-eastern ukraine, 
with significant improvements in production rates, leading to  
a much improved financial performance. the fiscal and economic situation in ukraine continues 
to improve, with a better economic outlook, gdp growth 
and improved stability in the ukrainian hryvnia exchange 
rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately. the ukrainian government has implemented a number of 
reforms in the oil and gas industry in recent years, which 
include the deregulation of the gas supply market in late 2015, 
and more recently, reductions in the subsoil tax rates relating 
to oil and gas production and a proposed simplification of the 
regulatory procedures applicable to oil and gas exploration 
and production activities in ukraine. the deregulation of the gas supply market, supported 
by electronic gas trading platforms and improved pricing 
transparency, has meant that the market gas prices in ukraine 
now broadly correlate with the imported gas prices.
