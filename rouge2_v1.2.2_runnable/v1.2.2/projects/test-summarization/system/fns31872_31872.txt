we have seen growth in adjusted 
profit before tax, adjusted earnings per 
share, and return on equity although 
we saw a drop in the level of adjusted 
ebita margins from 20.8% to 19.4% 
reflecting inter alia significant investment 
expenditure during the year. cash and borrowings
net debt, which includes cash and 
cash equivalents, bank loans (excluding 
capitalised facility fees) and bank 
overdrafts, was £40.0m (2016: £34.7m) 
an increase of £5.3m on last year during 
another period of considerable growth 
and change in which we spent £20.3m 
(including deferred consideration) on 
acquisitions offset by the proceeds of 
£7.3m from the disposal of the underwood 
street offices. it 
is the board’s intention to maintain its 
progressive dividend policy whilst ensuring 
that suitable dividend cover of at least 
two times adjusted earnings per share is 
maintained. case study

 cash conversion represents the operating cash flow for the year as a percentage of adjusted operating profit before interest and amortisation. adjusted profit before tax (which now 
for the first time includes share based 
payment costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m)) 
increased 5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m). we closely monitor cash conversion which 
we expect to exceed 100% on an annual 
basis, and in 2017 that conversion rate 
was 114% (2016: 108%). 25570-4   ar2017  27 september 2017 10:58 am   proof 4
we continue to generate a high proportion 
of our revenue derived from quality and 
sustainable income streams and in 2017 
revenue from subscriptions and repeatable 
revenue was 77% of group revenue (2016: 
75%). the professional 
division provides expert and technical 
training as well as support services 
to professionals in corporate finance 
and capital markets and to qualified 
lawyers and accountants in the uk in 
both the profession and in industry. this 
division serves primarily tier 1 banks, the 
international financial services industry, 
us capital markets and small to medium 
sized professional accountancy and 
law firms. it focuses on the international 
financial services and international 
insurance markets as well as the uk 
pensions industry. this division 
includes our uk healthcare information 
businesses, our paris based european 
healthcare news agency, healthcare 
networking events and our legacy non-
healthcare data suppression and charity 
information businesses. i would 
once again like to express my own and 
my fellow board members’ appreciation 
of the hard work and dedication of our 
wilmington colleagues across the globe. hsj’s success can be attributed to a number of different factors. the weekly print magazine has been slowly 
phased out; july 2017 saw its last edition printed. an interesting fact is that the hsj content team, led by editor 
alastair mclellan, contains twice as many expert healthcare 
correspondents as employed by the bbc.
