forticrete is a leading manufacturer of 
concrete substitutes for natural stone 
walling, dressings and concrete roof tiles. market-wide demand has been 
such that our customers have on occasion 
faced extended waiting times for some of 
our products, especially soft mud bricks 
and roof tiles. in the uk, demand for building products is 
anticipated to increase due to government 
support for new housebuilding, increasing 
household formations and population 
growth. this investment in a replacement 
kiln increases capacity and maintains 
the group’s leading position as a full 
range supplier. overview
the demand for our products has again 
been strongly supported by good activity 
levels across the uk new housebuilding 
market. during the year, over 3,500 
cfcs were reported and corrected and 
whilst increasing awareness, this initiative 
must have also reduced the potential for 
accidents to occur. ibstock plc annual report and accounts 2017

underpins the group’s strategy to increase

the board’s decisions to invest in our new

to him leading ibstock through the next
