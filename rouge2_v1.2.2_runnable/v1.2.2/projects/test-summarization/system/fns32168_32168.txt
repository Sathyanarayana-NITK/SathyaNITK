resources on growing a sustainable 
regional airline. > remuneration committee – recommendation 
of executive performance-based remuneration

the best u k airline for 
punctuality by o ag in 
january 2017, placing

passengers flying 
from edinburgh and

flybe became the 
first regional airline to 
operate into l ondon

airlines and a new 
franchise agreement 
with blue islands 
further expanding the 
destinations available 
to our customers. > heads of t erms have 
been signed for a new 
franchise and joint 
venture alliance with 
eastern airways which 
enhances services to 
and from scotland. capacity was higher than we 
would have liked, therefore 
this has been deployed on 
33 new scheduled routes and 
we have increased frequency 
on existing routes. by continuing to strive for the 
highest quality customer service, 
getting our customers to their 
destination safely and on time, 
providing regional connectivity 
unlike any other airline, and 
improving profitability, we will 
continue to build a sustainable 
flybe for the future. we care about our customers
getting passengers to their destinations safely is 
our top priority. alongside that, we strive to deliver 
the highest quality customer service in everything 
we do. t his year we served more 
passengers – 8.8 million in total. a typical 
domestic flight can be charged up to 19 times the tax 
per mile of a long-haul one. results
revenue grew by 13.4% this year, compared to 8.7% last 
year. goal
our goal is for year-on-year 
improvement in passenger 
revenue per seat now that 
we are in control of our fleet 
and capacity. t he result has been lower load factors 
and yields. despite the substantial progress in reducing the 
size of legacy fleet orders in 2015/16, flybe has still 
seen significant capacity growth in a market where 
we witnessed slower growth in consumer demand. new routes 
and increased frequencies were targeted to cover 
marginal costs in the early years of operation, but 
do not contribute significantly to overall profitability. t he capacity growth therefore had a negative effect 
on profitability. shaping a  
sustainable future

enable customers to fulfil their 
global travel needs. consumer demand has continued to be fragile, 
subdued by tragic events in paris in november 2015 
and brussels in march 2016; and then by uncertainty 
arising from the brexit vote in june 2016. despite 
this backdrop, our continued growth in fleet size, the 
result of an aircraft order placed at the time of the 
ipo in 2010, forced us to grow the route network with 
new routes being launched, principally to utilise the 
aircraft we had. we reviewed and optimised 
our franchise partnerships. o ur digital 
transformation is a key enabler to 
improve the customer journey. t he breadth of flybe’s partners
