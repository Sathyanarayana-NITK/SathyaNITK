board priorities 
for 2018 
following on from the findings of our strategic review, 
we identified three areas of focus for 2018: reduce the 
group’s debt to manageable levels; repair and revitalise 
the tool hire business; and strengthen our commercial 
proposition across the group. in addition to our financial 
performance, this report provides 
you with an overview of our strategic 
review which was undertaken and 
presented during 2017. this has 
allowed us to develop a clear plan 
going forward, which will restore 
the business to historic levels of 
performance, delever the group 
and make us more resilient. our team of hssers are the reason we are able to deliver a hire 
experience that, we believe, is the best in the industry so we are 
committed to making sure they have the skills and support they 
need to flourish. we are delighted to share our story with you. alan peterson
chairman
dear shareholder,
following decisive action taken by the group 
board and senior management during 2017 ,  
we have seen a significant improvement in our 
performance in the second half of the financial 
year and we will now build upon this momentum 
by implementing our clear strategic priorities. focused on delivering safety, value, 
availability and support, we work 
predominantly with ‘business-to-
business’ customers in the ‘fit-out, 
maintain and operate’ sectors. our network: 
uk and ireland
during 2017 we closed a 
number of branches across 
the network due to lower 
rental revenue growth 
and a loss of focus on 
our tool hire business. we now have branches in more than 
250 locations, and following recent 
network reconfiguration changes, 
we will now be able to provide a 
greater availability of services to our 
customers across the uk and ireland. our values
across the business we have committed employees who live our core values, they are 
how we do business. we are dedicated to helping them 
all work safely, efficiently and 
cost-effectively. we are dedicated 
to helping them all work safely, efficiently and cost-effectively. safety
availability
value
support
safety is our priority and we work hard to ensure 
the safety of our customers and the equipment 
we hire to them as well as supporting their own 
progress towards ‘zero harm’ and ‘target zero’ 
goals. making sure our customers have ready availability 
of the kit they need, when and where they need  
it is key to our service offering, enabling us to 
guarantee that they can order by 7pm and get by 
noon the next day. these 
improving trends are demonstrated by our 
underlying rental revenue growth where 
we report 1.1% growth in h2 17 compared 
to h2 16. this underlying measure strips 
out the impact of branch closures in the 
two years, business divestments in 2017, 
the effect of week 53 in 2016, and rental 
revenues and disposal proceeds arising 
from the material asset disposals made in 
2016. this was augmented by continued 
growth in our services segment revenue 
and contribution which delivered 11.1% 
and 13.5% growth respectively in h2 17 
compared to h2 16. our relentless focus 
on cost reduction led to our overheads 
in q4 17 being £3.3m below the level in 
q1 17. however, notwithstanding these 
improvements we have made, year on year 
revenue decreased by 2% to £335.8m, 
with a decline in rental, which was 
impacted by operating model changes 
in 2016 and branch closures, offset by a 
growth in services, generating an adjusted 
ebita of £1.8m and return on capital 
employed (roce) of 0.9%. steve ashmore

our services segment directly 
complements our rental offering and 
comprises income from the group’s 
third party supplier rehire business (hss 
onecall) and hss training. focused on delivering safety, value, availability and support, 
we work predominantly with ‘business-to-business’ customers 
in the ‘fit-out’, maintain and operate sectors. we take a responsible approach to the way we conduct all 
business activities and we are iso 9001, iso 14001, ohsas 
18001, chas and safehire certified. this will include the expansion of test 
and run into all hss branches and 
customer distribution centres (cdcs) 
and more intensive repair into a 
number of strategically located 
workshop cdcs. in 2017 , we continued 
to underpin our commitment to value with a 
simplified pricing structure. the review was wide 
ranging in scope and involved the analysis 
of 20 million contract lines, more than 
delever
during 2017 we took a number of cost 
reduction actions which resulted in us 
delivering annualised savings of £13m 
compared with the q1 fy17 runrate. the strategic review announced in 
december 2017 outlined initiatives to 
reduce costs by a further £10m-£14m 
on an annualised basis, including up to 
£10m related to changes in the supply 
chain model. we were therefore pleased 
to announce in february 2018 that 
agreement had been finalised to make 
these changes enabling c.£11m of cost 
benefit, £1m higher than the amounts 
originally communicated. nothing 
in this report should be construed as a profit forecast. these changes resulted in an 
exceptional cost of £41m, which includes 
various one off payments in 2018 and cash 
payments of £33.8m over the following 
seven year period. our results
we have seen an improving trend in our 
performance in the second half of the 
financial year, with strong adjusted ebita 
growth compared with the first half. dividend
the board is focused on reducing net 
debt and, after careful consideration of the 
performance of the group during the year, 
and in line with the clear priorities set out 
in our strategic review, believes it is in the 
best interests of the shareholders of the 
group, to not pay a final dividend in 
respect of 2017.
looking ahead
the positive trading momentum in the 
second half of the financial year has 
continued into 2018. underlying revenue 
grew by 6% in the first quarter of 2018 
against prior year with underlying rental 
revenue growing 3% and our already 
actioned cost initiatives are delivering 
benefits as expected. annual report
