through	our	remodel	programme. our	apprentice	scheme	is	vitally	important	to	us. this	resulted	in	an	unchanged	level	of	cash	contributions

headwinds	and	macro	uncertainty. our	sales	were	declining,	we	were	tracking	c.3%	behind	our	competitors 	
as	measured	by	the	peach	tracker,	and	with	unprecedented	cost 	
headwinds	on	the	horizon,	we	knew	we	had	to	do	something	different. over the last year we have made further progress against 
our three strategic priorities which were introduced to 
address a period of like-for-like sales
a
 declines and market 
under-performance: 
•	 to build a more balanced business
•	 to instil a more commercial culture
•	 to drive an innovation agenda 
our	initiatives	in	these	areas	have	been	successful	in	restoring	sales 	
growth	and	mitigating	£26m	of	the	inflationary	cost	headwinds	which 	
we	faced	in	the	past	year. bob ivell
