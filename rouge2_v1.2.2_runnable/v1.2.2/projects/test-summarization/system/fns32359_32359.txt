the positive direction of travel is clear, as is the success 
of our programme of cost control. the board has been closely involved in the remuneration 
project, as i described in my statement last year, and i 
should like to thank all of our investment managers for their 
help and support in bringing this exercise to a successful 
completion. on page 4 of our chief executive officer (ceo),

financial results
the group’s reported revenue for the year ended 
31 march 2017 was £141.6 million, in line with that reported 
in the previous year. the reported profit before tax improved 
to £8.8 million, compared with a loss of £0.3 million in the 
previous year and a loss of £6.1 million in the year before 
that. funds under management and administration stood at 
£24.0 billion at the year-end, compared with £20.5 billion  
the year before, an increase of 17.1%. our cash position remains strong, at £58.4 million compared 
with £48.4 million at the previous year-end (both years are 
inclusive of cash balances held within assets held for sale). the high 
score of 93% overall client satisfaction achieved in this year’s 
surveys are testament to this. it is pleasing to announce 
that the transformation programme 
is bearing fruit, with sustained 
revenues despite the disposal of 
non-core activities last year, and 
a welcome return to profitability. so it gives me great 
pleasure to announce that the annual staff engagement 
survey carried out in november 2016 showed a sharp 11% 
increase in the overall engagement score to 67%. outlook
the two principal external drivers of our growth – the level of 
markets and the volume of investment trading – both surged 
after the brexit vote on 23 june 2016 and have remained 
buoyant ever since. indeed, we are 
experiencing a steady trend in previously self-directed 
clients seeking a discretionary service instead. while profound digital disruption is not 
yet on the horizon, it is important to ensure that our technology 
platforms permit a timely and flexible response to evolving 
client needs. we intend to foster such preparedness whilst 
continuing to provide first-class advice to our clients. our client satisfaction surveys are being 
remodelled to allow benchmarking 
within the wealth management industry 
and to ensure clients’ feedback is 
adequately captured and monitored. annual report and accounts 2017

designed and produced by frank, bright & abel
we operate in 24 uk locations. taken together with 
the interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share, this results in a 
total dividend for the year of 6.0 pence per share, an increase 
of 20% compared to 5.0 pence per share paid in the prior year. profits from the core 
business increased from £4.2 million in 2016 to £9.8 million 
this year reflecting an improvement in operating margin 
from 3.1% to 7.1%, paving the way towards our medium-term 
target of a 15% operating margin. performance 
fuma increased by 17.1% compared to 
a 15.9% increase in the wma balanced index. performance 
the discretionary average client portfolio size 
increased by 16.9%. over the years we have constantly reﬁ ned our proposition to meet 
the changing needs of our clients. our vision
our vision is to become the uk’s leading wealth 
manager by 2020. 
we deﬁ ne leading in terms of quality rather than quantity . two years into our vision, positive transformation across 
the business sees us on track to achieving this. our values
charles stanley’s core values – caring, fair and 
progressive – have provided an overarching framework 
within which we operate, supporting our underlying 
strategy to always work in our clients’ best interests
and offer a truly personal service. this mirrors the 
improvement in the market index that we track, though 
the increase in discretionary funds was significantly ahead 
of this over the 12-month period, up from £9.4 billion to 
£11.4 billion, or 21.3%. dividend
i have previously outlined our policy to return to a pattern 
of steadily increasing dividends once profitability starts to 
improve significantly. this provides a favourable backdrop for 
our transformation programme and should bring growth in 
revenues, profits and margins, which in turn will support our 
progressive dividend policy and thus generate long-term 
shareholder value. financial measures – fuma and revenue margins
definition 
fuma by investment category. charles stanley 
provides holistic wealth management services to private clients, 
charities and smaller institutions. our services include personalised 
investment portfolio management, pooled solutions, ﬁ nancial 
planning advice and an award-winning execution-only dealing 
platform, charles stanley direct. remuneration structures
it is pleasing to report that by the year-end we had 
substantially completed our major project of restructuring 
the remuneration arrangements of our investment managers. as a consequence we have greater alignment 
with the strategy of the business and better regulatory 
outcomes – for example the incentive structures in 
investment management services and financial planning 
are no longer purely financial but are also linked directly 
to standards of conduct. focusing on client satisfaction as well as staff engagement 
and equity market rating, we measure our progress 
against these targets year-on-year. this 
illustrates that our staff are taking an active and engaged 
approach to our significant programme of improvement. a strong cost control culture was evident across all units 
and each of our four client-facing divisions delivered 
positive underlying momentum. strategy implementation
the strategy determined in early 2015 required considerable 
preparatory work but i am pleased to be able to report that 
this is now largely in place and the benefits to both clients 
and shareholders are materialising.
