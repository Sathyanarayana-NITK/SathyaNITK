the financial review presents the comparative results of the group on both a 
pro forma reporting basis and on a statutory reporting basis. on a statutory 
basis, the prior period comparative results are for the 18 month period  
ended 31 december 2016, and include the results of partnership assurance 
group plc (“partnership”) only for the nine months following acquisition at the 
beginning of april 2016. in order to present information that enables a clearer 
comparison of results for the current year against the prior period, the group 
has chosen to present additional pro forma financial information for the 12 
months ended 31 december 2016 prepared on the basis that the merger 
between just retirement and partnership had already taken place as at 
1 january 2016. pro forma information is unaudited. a reconciliation of pro 
forma financial information to statutory financial information for the period  
to 31 december 2016 is given at the end of the financial review section. jrp group was renamed just group following a vote at the agm on 18 may 
2017. “group”, “company” and “just” are used interchangeably throughout 
the report to refer to just group plc unless explicitly stated. board composition and governance
i take great pride in leading the board and 
the group’s governance function, and i am 
pleased to confirm we have benefited from 
continuity of membership since the agm in 
2017. shortly before the agm we announced 
that james fraser and peter catterall wished 
to step down as non-executive directors of 
the company and i would like to thank them 
for their significant contribution to the group 
over many years. the solutions for de-risking can be medically 
underwritten, meaning that insurers use 
individual members’ medical and lifestyle 
information to assess their longevity as 
opposed to relying on proxies such as the 
member’s age, pension amount and possibly 
postcode. in the uk, gifls traditionally 
offered an income payable without reference 
to the individual’s health or lifestyle, and 
were differentiated only by reference to a 
limited number of factors such as age, 
postcode, premium size and, prior to 
31 december 2012, gender. the fpp can be used in conjunction 
with gifl, enabling customers to mix and 
match to meet their needs. for some schemes, medically 
underwritten pricing is typically better  
value than traditional non-medically 
underwritten pricing. while insurer capacity will 
increase in the long term, over the medium 
term we believe the demand for de-risking 
solutions exceeds the current supply 
available from providers. the capacity of companies to deliver
de-risking solutions is constrained. corporate clients: solving

total of 3.72 pence per share for 2017 (2016 
calendar year: 3.5 pence per share). the group has a robust strategy, a strong 
management team and we enjoy a 
competitive advantage based on our 
hard-to-replicate intellectual property. we 
are focused on some of the most attractive 
growing markets in the retirement sector 
and we are confident this growth will 
continue, given the strong structural drivers 
supporting it. profit growth continues
participating in economically attractive 
growing markets enables us to be selective in 
the risks we choose to write and this has 
enabled us to improve our margins and grow 
profits, rather than pursue headline sales 
growth in search of market share. the cost efficiency achieved 
from the merger has contributed significantly 
to improved margins, as explained in more 
detail in the financial review.
