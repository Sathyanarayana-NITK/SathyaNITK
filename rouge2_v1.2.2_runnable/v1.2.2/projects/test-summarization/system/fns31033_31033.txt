*  all figures in the narrative of the strategic report are underlying unless otherwise stated. underlying explanation is in note 2 to the financial statements on page 132. †  unless otherwise stated, all underlying financial data excludes the impact of the acquisition of itp aero, 
completed on 19 december 2017. ‡  all references to organic change are at constant translational currency, excluding m&a. performance management, cost 
competitiveness and operational delivery 
against commitments are as fundamental  
to our longer-term aspirations and goals  
as are product innovation and technology. rolls-royce has  
an extraordinary brand and we are 
exceptionally well-placed to defy the 
traditional engineering industry norms. this was 
achieved while focusing on managing the 
well-publicised in-service fleet issues on 
the trent 1000 and trent 900 engines that 
led to increased costs as efforts were made 
to minimise the disruptive impact on our 
customers and to develop longer-term 
solutions. operational excellence – a new operating 
strategy was developed and we invested  
a further £764m in capital expenditure  
in 2017. capitalising on the rapidly 
advancing digital techniques, our aim is  
to create an agile, highly productive and  
cost-competitive manufacturing footprint. by their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty,  
and a number of factors could cause material differences to the actual results or developments. the business 
serves the marine, defence, 
power generation and  
industrial markets. progress will not  
be smooth, given the nature of the industry 
and the number of new products we are in 
the process of introducing into the market, 
and i do not want to underestimate the  
risks. growth opportunities for us in 
our core industries are excellent. civil

our five businesses in 2017
civil  
aerospace
civil aerospace is a major 
manufacturer of aero engines 
for the large commercial  
aircraft, regional jet and 
business aviation markets. we have delivered financial  
results ahead of budget and expectations 
and we have ramped up production in our 
civil aerospace business. we have initiated  
a simplification of the group into three 
businesses and are embarking upon a 
fundamental restructuring. the business uses its 
engineering expertise,  
in-depth knowledge and 
capabilities to provide  
through-life support  
solutions for its customers. our civil 
nuclear operation supplies  
safety-critical systems to  
about half the world’s  
nuclear power plants. we are 
well advanced in the complex process of 
overhauling our management information 
systems. these collaborations range across 
electronics, composite materials, gearbox 
technology, digital technologies and 
services. any statements that express forecasts, 
expectations and projections are not guarantees of future performance and guidance may be updated 
from time to time. this report is intended to provide information to shareholders, and is not designed  
to be relied upon by any other party or for any other purpose, and the company and its directors accept 
no liability to any other person other than that required under english law. latest information will be  
made available on the group’s website. see page 8 for more information. we are acutely aware 
of the challenge this has created for some  
of our customers. our absolute priority  
is to overcome these. this has been a sobering 
experience for all concerned. the board 
and executive team remain totally 
committed to always acting with integrity 
and to ensuring that the appropriate values 
and behaviours are embedded throughout 
the group. but, the medium-term prospects  
look increasingly bright and the long-term 
opportunities for us remain significant. our near to medium-term priorities are:  
to improve operational performance, with 
the focus on product reliability for our 
customers and on cost competitiveness;  
and cash flow generation for our long-term 
prosperity. we have  
to build customer satisfaction and cash flow 
and, as a consequence, strengthen investor 
confidence, to enable us to capitalise on 
these. we have 
refreshed our strategy and long-term vision.
