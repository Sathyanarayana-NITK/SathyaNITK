the group has approximately 120 staff based predominantly in leicester (uk), boston (us) and minsk 
(belarus). contracts are directly with the end-customers (typically minimum period of 2 years), 
with a small percentage of recurring revenues being paid to the relevant crm partner as long as their 
customer remains a cloudcall customer. cloudcall services are invoiced monthly on a per user, per month basis. 87% of 
the group’s revenues are therefore either recurring or repeating in nature. currently the group primarily focuses its products and services on two 
core crm partners: salesforce and bullhorn. in addition to the focus on the three core partners identified above, cloudcall also considers its products 
and services to be extremely relevant for companies within the staffing and recruitment sector, and 
consequently has partnerships with several smaller staffing and recruitment crms. furthermore, the group’s relationship with its key strategic partner - bullhorn 
crm - has continued to strengthen across bullhorn’s global footprint. cloudcall group plc

resource limitations were also being keenly felt in product development, where for much of the year a 
significant portion of our software development resource was focussed on rebuilding our core 
infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform that would enable us to scale more 
quickly in 2018. this exercise naturally restricted our ability to launch new revenue impacting products 
and services in 2017. 
an improved platform to facilitate growth 
driven largely by the millennial generation, there is an underlying shift from the more traditional 
methods of communication towards texting and instant messaging. when calculating user numbers, the group considers the receipt of a signed order for an ongoing 
subscription as a “sale”. further analysis regarding revenues can be found in note 5 to the financial statements. further details can be found in the ‘principal risks and uncertainties’ section on pages 17 to 20, and 
note 11 on intangibles. going concern  
the directors confirm that, as disclosed in note 1 on page 44, they have a reasonable expectation that 
the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. the group’s head office and registered office address is 1 colton square, leicester, le1 1qh, 
uk. cloudcall group plc

cloudcall works closely with key crm partners through which it reaches most of its end customers and 
their users. in july 2017 we confirmed that the company’s lender, barclays, agreed to provide an improved three-
year revolving credit facility of £1.85m to replace the previous £0.9m two-year term loan, which enabled 
management to invest in the business with more confidence. in march 2018, bullhorn announced that it had completed the acquisitions of both talentrover and 
jobscience, recruitment crms built on the force.com platform (like connexys). operational control is delegated by the board to the executive directors. non-executive directors are 
in regular communication with the executive directors. the board of directors 
the board of directors currently consists of three executive and three non-executive directors. director profiles

non-executive chairman 
peter is a chartered certified accountant, who retired from the role of ceo of dotdigital group plc in 
june 2015 after 8 years. cloudcall and its subsidiaries (the “group”) operate as a software and unified communications business 
that has developed and provides a suite of cloud-based integrated software and telephony products 
and services under the name “cloudcall”. the group’s principal activity is to provide products and 
services designed to improve business performance by enabling client communications to be driven by 
the data held within customer relationship management (“crm”) software. the cloudcall suite of products allows companies to fully integrate their telephony systems into their 
existing crm software, enabling calls to be made, recorded, logged and categorised from within the 
crm system from which detailed activity reports can be easily generated. the group’s software and telephony platform is currently enabling over 23,500 users across 875 
customers to drive more effective communications directly from the intelligence that exists within their 
crm system. repeating revenue is related to pay-as-you-go 
telephony revenue which, whilst not directly contracted, has a high degree of visibility and predictability. these service fees 
facilitate effective on-boarding, which in turn leads to higher levels of user adoption and a demonstrably 
faster return on investment for customers. cloudcall group plc

our strategy 
the group’s core objectives remain to deliver strong top-line growth, to continue to drive the business 
toward ebitda break-even, to deliver a high-quality product and customer experience and to 
encourage a strong and ethical corporate culture. to achieve these objectives, it focuses its resources 
as follows:

and microsoft dynamics

reduce average customer costs by continuing to improve onboarding processes, lowering 
ongoing costs of support per customer and reducing churn rates 
 focus on strengthening relationships and growing revenues from existing and future enterprise 
level customers by expanding cloudcall penetration across their organisations 
 focus on developing deep understanding and expertise within key industry verticals such as 
staffing and recruitment, to ensure cloudcall products and services not only meet, but exceed 
the needs of those markets   
 focus on providing the highest standards of customer service and support to increase customer 
satisfaction levels, referenceabilty and brand reputation whilst also reducing churn 
 continuing to develop cloudcall into a market-leading, feature-rich service, delivering an 
exceptional value-adding customer experience, with high availability and reliability aligned with 
best-in-class security 
 fostering a positive corporate culture, investing in staff and building relationships with local 
charities and the community in general
