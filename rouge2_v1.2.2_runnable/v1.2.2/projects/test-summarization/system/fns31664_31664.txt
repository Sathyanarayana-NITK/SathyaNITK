during the year, the asset finance business acquired in 2015 and the development finance business 
launched organically continued to develop, while the mortgages division launched its first pilot offerings in the 
specialist owner-occupied mortgage market. income assets funding profitability
the group generates 
income from interest, fees 
and charges earned on its 
mortgage, consumer and 
sme loan assets. it also earns 
fees from third parties for 
administering similar loans 
on their behalf. to grow its income, the 
group focuses on building 
its asset base by originating 
new loans, developing new 
products and acquiring 
loan portfolios. these have been made by the directors in good faith using information available up to the date 
on which they approved this report. this represents a major milestone in the group’s strategic development, transitioning to a banking group 
deriving significant funding from retail deposits, while providing new finance options for underserved 
uk customers. the group has also made progress in its asset diversification strategy, which will support its medium-term 
objective of improving net interest margin and cost efficiency, with increasing business volumes capable of 
being supported by the investments in operations, infrastructure and start-up costs already being put in place. as a result of the reorganisation, you will see significant changes in these accounts, both to better reflect the 
new structure of the group and to enhance comparability with other businesses in the sector. profit before tax on the statutory basis grew by 1.1% to 
£144.8 million. this led to earnings per share increasing by 6.4% to 43.1 pence (2016: 40.5 pence) and return 
on tangible equity reaching 13.4% (2016: 12.9%). the cet1 ratio at 30 september 2017 remained stable at 15.9% (2016: 15.9%). as a result, we have declared a final dividend for the year of 11.0 pence per share, bringing 
the dividend for the year to 15.7 pence per share, up 16.3%, subject to shareholder approval. 2017 annual report and accounts

group. social responsibility issues are discussed in section a5
governance
the group is committed to good corporate governance and complied with the new 2016 version of the uk 
corporate governance code (the ‘code’) in the year. as part of the group’s restructuring, i have been delighted to 
welcome four new non-executive directors to the board, pat newberry, barbara ridpath, finlay williamson and 
graeme yorston, significantly adding to the board’s regulatory and retail banking experience. these strengths are complemented 
by a highly developed loan servicing platform and through the 
cycle experience in its senior management team. it seeks to build 
a broad and diversified funding mix to underpin the business. these values – fairness, 
integrity, respect, professionalism, teamwork, commitment, humour and creativity – inform the way that we 
interact with our customers, our colleagues and our wider stakeholders. importantly, paragon’s employees agree 
that customers are at the heart of our business and recognise the value of treating customers fairly. 2. 3. 5. 6. by their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because 
they relate to future events and circumstances that are beyond the control of the group and depend upon circumstances 
that may or may not occur in the future. there are a number of factors that could cause actual future financial conditions, 
business performance, results or developments to differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations expressed or implied 
by these forward-looking statements and forecasts. nothing in this document should be construed as a profit forecast. i hope you will 
find these changes helpful. * segmental profit for divisions is stated before central funding and overhead costs (note 14). tot al loans to customers ret ail deposits
