business segments 
3 
we operate four segments as follows: 
 brands websites  
uk & ireland 
• currys and pc world are the largest specialist electrical retailing 
and services operators in the uk & ireland. • carphone warehouse is the largest independent 
telecommunications retailer in the uk & ireland. • dixons travel operates in major uk airports and dublin. postpay volumes and market 
share continued to grow year-on-year in relatively quiet 
markets as the business benefited from the exit of phones 4u 
and successful product launches. we are also - cautiously - 
encouraged by the impact on arpu from higher levels of  
data usage. as a result our market share improved, in 
particular in the higher value post-pay segments. mobile telephony has evolved rapidly, from simple mobile 
devices to sophisticated hardware with advanced computing 
functionality. nothing in this annual report and accounts should be regarded as a profit forecast. dixons carphone plc annual report and accounts 2014/15

headline and pro forma performance measures are as defined in the performance review. pro forma results are presented as if the cpw europe acquisition and the 
merger had occurred at the start of the comparative period. some important 
strategic goals have also been achieved, most notably the 
disposals of non-core operations in france, germany, the 
netherlands and portugal. in eleven months we have 
established the new organisational structures of the group,  
uk & ireland, and sweden, rolled out almost 250 carphone 
warehouse swas, exited retail operations in germany and the 
netherlands, signed material contracts in connected world 
services, and launched a new mvno in the uk under the id 
brand. our mobile business in the uk & ireland also saw 
very encouraging sales growth. also in the uk, we launched our new mvno, id, in may. we have seen excellent increases  
in both sales and profitability and we have made very encouraging progress with the 
tricky job of integrating these two great companies. the job is far from done. i am acutely aware that there is no room for complacency  
in a sector which has seen unprecedented change, bringing both opportunities and  
challenges. to achieve these, we will need to  
exhibit creativity, energy, resilience and toughness of purpose. much has been 
achieved on this vital journey and, in particular, it gives me 
enormous pleasure to see so many fully-functioning carphone 
warehouse stores doing so well inside curryspcworld stores 
up and down the country. enabled by an innovative it platform, it will target a number  
of specific customer segments, with a particular focus on 
personalising plans with flexible tariffs and introducing shared 
data tariffs, market-leading roaming and the re-introduction of - 
already very popular - 12 month contracts. we continue to focus 
on pricing and new product and service offerings, such as our 
‘epoq’ kitchen range and the rollout of knowhow. i began by listing some of the many achievements we 
have accomplished in the year, but to do all this whilst ensuring 
we did not take our eye off the ball is a testament to the 
creativity, skill, fortitude and hard work of the very talented 
men and women that make up dixons carphone. • knowhow is our market leading services brand. • pc world business provides computing products and services  
to business to business (b2b) customers. kotsovolos kotsovolos.gr

connected world services 
• the group has 25 years experience in the mobile industry and 
several decades in consumer electronics, and has developed 
sophisticated it systems and operating processes to help 
customers navigate through the extensive range of network 
package plans and other ancillary products and services. it has  
also evolved bespoke customer relationship management tools 
which enable services such as upgrade reminders, data storage  
and tariff checks. at the same time, we have continued 
to generate strong customer satisfaction numbers, made significant strides in our  
connected world services business including our agreement with sprint, and launched  
a brand new mobile network. we have set ourselves ambitious goals, not only financial, but also in terms  
of driving customer happiness, building a completely integrated company and delivering  
a brand new global services business with cws. progress has been good 
across the board and in virtually all territories, with excellent 
market share gains in all core countries in all key categories, 
and record customer satisfaction numbers. in addition, it is good to see real 
traction with some key new clients in our connected world 
services business including our agreement with sprint. ii. iii. iv. we brought the businesses 
together because we believed that increasingly interconnected 
customers were going to require something new from us: a 
powerful partner to help them navigate these new technologies. there is no doubt that technology is evolving, 
consumer behaviour is shifting, the supplier landscape is 
changing and, of course, in the telecommunications world, that 
there are a number of important m&a transactions pending. we believe that change creates opportunity for us as 
consumers turn more and more to those who can offer 
genuine impartial advice and service at very competitive prices, 
and as suppliers rely more and more on us to tell their stories 
fairly and well to their customers. in electricals, 
white goods and tvs sold particularly well with customers 
responding to our range, pricing and - above all - service 
initiatives.
