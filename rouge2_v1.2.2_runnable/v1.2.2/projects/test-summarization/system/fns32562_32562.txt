over the past year 
highlights the extent 
of our ambitions  
and our potential  
for the future” 
we are highly ambitious, not for ambition’s sake, but 
because we are clear about the need for the regeneration  
projects we create. with a track record of over 25 years of investment and 
development, and a diverse team of property experts, our  
£6 billion portfolio contains a mixture of longer-term large-
scale regeneration projects, shorter-term trading 
opportunities and investment assets (see pages 22 to 39). read more on p.22-39

u+i is establishing a reputation as a leading 
regeneration developer and the public sector’s 
development partner of choice. brunel 
place is a first-rate building that is set to benefit from 
the strength of its location and the high demand for 
quality commercial space. household budgets are 
being squeezed by the rising cost of 
everyday goods, as wage growth 
remains elusive. commercial – pockets of potential
within the commercial property  
space, the cycle is at a point where 
rents are broadly stable and yields 
static but where construction costs 
are rising. against this, development 
has been limited for almost a decade 
so the supply of office space is tight 
and vacancies are low. what underpins this is our genuine passion for unlocking 
the potential of undervalued urban sites, transforming  
them into thriving communities and neighbourhoods. our focus is to
hunt for overlooked and undervalued sites in 
areas of the market where value can be driven 
through regeneration. this new retail 
destination opened in november 2016 and 
we have carefully curated a mix of tenants 
to create a retail experience that embraces 
the culture and community of deptford. u+i 
is distinctive. matthew weiner

investor. we realise gains and drive value as we unlock the 
potential of land and assets. at u+i, however, we are optimistic about the future and 
our ability to proactively drive value and generate strong 
cash flows as evidenced by the board declaring a third 
consecutive supplemental dividend in addition to our 
ordinary dividend. it delivers tangible socio-
economic benefits and it creates value for shareholders. we have an equity-efficient approach to development, whereby 
we limit our financial exposure through the public private  
partnership (ppp) model (see pages 28 to 31). our achievements were 
recently recognised with a ‘placemaking 
award’ at the property week awards. creating specialist

our people are what allow us to do what we 
do. our activity is focused on three core geographical areas – the 
london city region*, manchester and dublin – where we 
see liquidity and sufficient depth through the cycle as well as 
growth in demand. in effect, they allow
us to do more than we could on our own. the results are noteworthy, given the impact of the uk’s 
decision to leave the eu, following the referendum in june 
2016. in the months following that referendum, a pall of 
uncertainty hung over the property market, as investment 
decisions were delayed and activity stalled. it stands out within the property sector both 
in what it does and the way it does it. as our business expands and develops, the combination 
of our operational focus and our financial model will 
deliver consistent, long-term value, driven by a dynamic 
blend of development, trading and investment activity. we have a talent for buying well and delivering value through 
planning and development. we 
are experts in managing the complexities of the planning system 
to deliver high quality, mixed-use regeneration projects. this combination of projects allows us to generate consistent 
returns and income through the property cycles. the plans for the regeneration of mayfield will  
rejuvenate a site which has been derelict for more than 
three decades, breathing new life into a once  
thriving city district. first constructed in 1937,  
this grade ii listed building was originally the 
headquarters of the london fire brigade before 
becoming the home to lambeth fire station. our plans for 8 albert embankment will take the site 
into the next chapter of its life. we are completely 
redesigning the space to create a modern, fit-for-
purpose fire station and training yard within a wider 
mixed-use regeneration project, delivering a new 
landmark for london. u and i group plc  annual report and accounts 2017

8 albert embankment will house a permanent 
london fire brigade museum alongside the 
operating station. at the end of our second year, we are on our way  
to achieving our ambitious targets with a focus on  
value creation and a clear strategy to get us there. we are proud of our ability to deliver 
them and we understand the value, both financial and 
social, that can be generated from them. we focus on opportunities where 
our size and expertise afford us competitive advantage. these locations have the talent, tenants 
and tourism to succeed.
