strategic report
the directors now present their 
strategic report with the financial 
statements of nostra terra oil and gas 
company plc (“the company”) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively “the group”) 
for the year ended 31 december 2017.
principal activity
the group’s principal activity is the 
exploitation of hydrocarbon resources 
focusing at present in the usa 
and egypt. in response to the requisition 
for a general meeting to seek change 
to magnolia’s board, magnolia’s existing 
directors chose to complete a highly 
dilutive deal, which we believe added 
precious little in terms of value to that 
company and was unfortunate for 
magnolia’s shareholders. we have been proactive in 
suggesting solutions to the issues 
raised, and sought positive resolutions. review of business, future 
developments, trading outlook 
and future strategy
the results for the year and financial 
position of the company and the group 
are shown in the financial statements 
on pages 16 to 25, and are noted in 
the chairman’s report on page 3 and 
the chief executive officer’s report 
on page 4.
key performance indicators
at this stage in the company’s 
development, the directors regularly 
monitor key performance indicators 
associated with managing liquid 
resources, namely: cash flows and 
bank balances; general administrative 
expenses, which are tightly controlled; 
and the level of production. further information relating to risk can 
be found at note 21 to these accounts. these are not substantial 
and are considered non-core assets. the range of materiality allocated across components was between £44,000 and £8,500. retained loss represents the cumulative losses of the group attributable to owners of the company. retained loss represents the cumulative losses of the company attributable to owners of the company. for 
minimal outlay we will increase nostra 
terra’s assets to just over 1 million 
barrels of 2p reserves. the group is exposed 
to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are 
denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling (£). the group maintains a natural hedge that minimises its 
foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency 
income with foreign currency costs. rationale for 
benchmark applied
we believe that profit before tax and gross 
assets are the primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the group, and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark

results and dividends
the loss for the year was £1,153,000, which has 
been allocated against reserves. the closing mid-market price at 31 december 2017 
was 4.35p (2016: 1.97p). the group incurred a net 
loss of £1,044,000 during the year ended 31 december 2017 
and, at that date, had net current liabilities of £1,571,000 
with net liabilities of £226,000. to secure the hedging facility we 
underwent a vigorous due diligence 
process. in preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business; and
• follow ifrs as adopted by the european union. they 
make no statement of compliance with the code overall 
and do not ‘explain’ in detail any aspect of the code with 
which they do not comply.’
the directors recognise the importance of sound corporate 
governance, commensurate with the group’s size and 
shareholders’ interests. as the group grows, policies and 
procedures that reflect the frc’s uk corporate governance 
code will be developed. thanks to 
our efforts in 2016, nostra terra was 
well positioned to benefit greatly 
from this. this ideally 
suited nostra terra because it meant we 
could control the pace of development 
of these assets, as conditions and our 
finances allowed. this was a significant 
leap forward for nostra terra and 
provided a ringing endorsement 
of the success of our new strategy. in summary, i believe the future 
looks very bright for nostra terra. the price of oil was 
consolidating and signs of recovery 
across the industry were in sight. the company has since 
taken significant steps forward in 
realising its ambitions, delivering 
robust returns for shareholders. our strategic focus switched in 2016 
to repositioning our portfolio of assets 
with the goal of growing stable oil 
production and reserves, which would 
be profitable at $30/bbl. as stated 
a year ago, these reported reserves 
were bankable and laid the foundation 
to enabling nostra terra to gain access 
to the working capital required to 
grow long term oil production. twelve months later and the sector 
has rebounded strongly. in particular 
we sought to acquire leases, which were 
held by production (hbp). in early 2017 we completed our 
second acquisition in the permian basin, 
texas, and by april had increased the 
company’s current proven reserves (1p) 
in the us to 522,000 barrels. to that end, nostra terra raised 
£500,000 in a placing in late april 2017 
and in september secured a hedging 
facility for future oil production with bp 
energy company. eight days 
after the period ended, we finalised 
terms of a $5 million senior lending 
facility with washington federal bank, 
at an initial interest rate of 4.75% 
with an initial borrowing base of 
$1.2 million. revenues for the year were £1,128,000 
an increase of 300% from 2016. loss for 
the year was £1,044,000. in april 2017 
the company raised £500,000 through 
an equity placing at 2 pence per share. included in this were 1 for 1 warrants, 
exercisable within 12 months at 3 pence 
per share.
