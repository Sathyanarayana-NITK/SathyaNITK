normalised 
income pro t, which excludes pro ts or losses 
from the sale of properties (essentially the 
repeatable earnings of the business), increased 
by 22.3% to £48.2 million (2013: £39.4 million). normalised income pro t per share increased 
by 14.5% to 7 .1p (2012: 6.2p). basic earnings per share were 17 .6p (2013: 
9.1p) and diluted epra earnings per share were 
5.2p (2013: 5.0p). pro t before tax increased by 
100.9% to £131 .2 million (2013: £65.3 million). our dividend policy is designed 
to re#ect the high income generated by the 
business and we remain committed to a 
prudently progressive dividend policy. 2014 has been 
a year in which all elements of our business model have excelled and 
i am delighted to report record results in terms of pro ts and value 
growth, re#ected in an increased interim dividend together with a 
special dividend. our strategy is achieved through a 
detailed assessment of opportunities in the 
uk and continental europe. our people are at the centre of our success. 4

owned or co-owned, comprises 4.2 million 
sq m or 45.4 million sq ft at a passing yield of 
8.5%, occupancy of 86.0%, and over 6,000 
tenants, none of whom account for more than 
1 .2% of the entire rent roll. the total uplift of £135.8 million was the highest in any 
year for hansteen. this combined with dividends paid in the year of 5.4% 
equates to a return in excess of 17.0%. during that 
period we acquired £1 .6 billion of property 
and sold £649.0 million from the owned or 
co-owned portfolio. in 2014, with the market gathering momentum, 
the  gures were £315.3 million sold and 
£267 .7 million purchased. had the currency remained 
unchanged throughout the year, the portfolio 
would have been worth an additional £59.1

chairman’s review proposes to re#ect this success in the payment 
of a special dividend of 3.0p per share, which 
will be paid in addition to the ‘ongoing’ interim 
dividend also of 3.0p per share. board changes
stephen gee retired as a non-executive 
director of the company at the annual general 
meeting in 2014 and richard mully will retire as 
a non-executive director of the company at the 
annual general meeting on 8 june 2015.
as part of the process of succession planning 
for non-executive directors, melvyn egglenton 
and rebecca worthington were welcomed 
to the board on 10 june 2014. melvyn and 
rebecca were also appointed as members 
of both the audit committee and the 
remuneration committee, effective from the 
same date. founder long-term incentive plan (ltip)
the ltip is based on the growth of epra nav 
plus dividends, which was put in place for the 
joint chief executives at the time of the initial 
#oatation in 2005 and which has not paid out 
to date. there are few equivalent platforms to hansteen’s in the 
high-yielding property sector. we aim to realise 
and distribute these pro ts to our shareholders 
over the course of a property cycle either by 
sales of individual lots or by larger portfolio 
disposals. we 
have sold a signi cant amount of property into 
a very buoyant uk investment market releasing 
capital and allowing hansteen to make some 
noteworthy acquisitions. we then apply our particular 
brand of intensive management to increase the 
occupancy, increase the rent and reduce the 
irrecoverable costs. 5

results
normalised total pro t for the year to 31 
december 2014 increased by 41 .0% to £65.3 
million (2013: £46.3 million). had it not been 
for the fall in the value of the euro compared 
with 31 december 2013, normalised total pro t 
for 2014 would have been £1 .9 million higher. dividend
hansteen has paid a covered dividend every 
year since the  rst dividend distribution in 
2006 and during that period, it has increased 
by 66.7%. the 
board already increased the interim dividend 
paid on 20 november 2014 by 5.3% to 2.0p per 
share (november 2013: 1 .9p per share) and will 
pay the second ongoing dividend, increased 
by 3.4% to 3.0p per share (may 2013: 2.9p) 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 5.0p, 
a 4.2% increase on 2013. 
 
in 2014, hansteen took advantage of a strong 
investment market to sell £315.3 million 
of property from the owned or co-owned 
portfolio, crystallising pro ts of £26.1 million 
over the 31 december 2013 valuation and £47 .7 
million over gross acquisition cost. details are set out below in the  nance report. none of the conditions that would allow a 
bondholder to convert were met during the 
year; therefore the dilutive impact of the bonds 
is excluded from epra nav . the principal terms of the 
bonds are detailed in the notes to the  nancial 
statements. • hedges are implemented at levels which 
the board believe are cost effective.
