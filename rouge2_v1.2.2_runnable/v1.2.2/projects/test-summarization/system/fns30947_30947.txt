strong track  
record
we have over 50 years’ operating 
experience in the americas and in  
the last decade have an enviable track 
record of meeting stated production 
and cost targets. the 
numerous political/economic issues 
provided ample reason for investors 
to remain interested in 2017, which 
resulted in the healthy net addition 
to investor gold holdings. while 
these additions were down versus 
2016 they were still very high by 
historical standards. the present level of additions puts 
purchases on track to match levels 
seen from 2010 to 2012. the top 
three contributors during 2017 were 
the central banks of russia, t urkey, 
and kazakhstan. up 4%

a world-class  
asset portfolio
in 2017, our four current operating mines 
produced 19.1 million attributable ounces 
of silver and 254,930 ounces of gold 
which resulted in another overall record 
of 38 million silver equivalent ounces. project estimated silver equivalent production p.a. 2,800

a world-class  
asset portfolio
in 2017 , we once again delivered record 
production figures with 19 . 1 million 
attributable ounces of silver and just over 
254,000 ounces of gold. we are positioned to deliver 
additional ounces at a competitive 
cost through organic expansion and 
there is still plenty more to  come. we 
are aiming to continue to drive low cost growth from the 
business over the next few years through a combination 
of new discoveries, optimising our current portfolio and 
potential increased throughput from our plants. exciting discovery  
opportunities
we have a pipeline of brownfield 
and greenfield projects in numerous 
locations across three countries in the 
americas, as well as substantial parcels  
of premium geological land. we intend to continue 
to explore the area, add further 
resources and then we will be in 
position to make a decision on 
whether to expand our modular 
processing plant or to add to 
inmaculada’s life-of-mine. in 2017 , the 
company received the peruvian 
government approval to begin 
mining the pablo vein, increasing 
the throughput up to 2,800 tonnes 
per day during 2018 and delivering 
competitive costs. annual report & accounts 2017

where we operate
the operational and geological 
experience we have developed  
over many years has allowed us to 
maximise the productivity of our 
current operations, develop mining 
projects and find new deposits  
across the americas. pallancata –  
realising significant 
potential
since its discovery in 2015, the 
pablo area including the main 
pablo vein and ancillary veins has 
hugely expanded its contained 
tonnage and grade. this marked the 
fifth consecutive year of output increases. in 2017, we made further 
encouraging progress with net debt 
almost halved versus the end of 
2016 and a refinancing programme 
towards the end of the year that is 
expected to result in significant 
reductions in the company’s 
ongoing interest payments. this has been 
particularly evident in periods of 
significant price volatility over the 
last five years. 87%
