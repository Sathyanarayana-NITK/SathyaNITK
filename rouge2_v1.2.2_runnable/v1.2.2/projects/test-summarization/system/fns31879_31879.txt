the associated risks¹ what we do the value this creates
we purchase land in targeted locations 
which at least meets our hurdle rates 
of 20% gross margin and 25% site 
roce. although the group believes that its expectations are 
based on reasonable assumptions, any statements about future 
outlook may be influenced by factors that could cause actual 
outcomes and results to be materially different. the value of key 
metrics disclosed in the prior year are unaffected by this change. we delivered our highest number of completions for nine years with continued  
strong performance against our financial and operational key performance indicators. we achieved record profits, completion volumes were 
at their highest level for nine years and we remain industry leading in terms of quality 
and customer service. we then work closely with local 
communities and authorities to deliver 
effective planning permissions. the government’s housing white 
paper published in february contained many 
positive measures, particularly those aimed 
at speeding up the planning system and 
bringing forward more land for new homes. following the outcome of the eu referendum, 
the board continues to monitor carefully the 
potential impacts of the vote to leave the eu 
on our business. it is embedded in our policies, procedures 
and processes throughout our business from 
board level to our divisional operations. we build 
great homes and aim to provide customer 
service that exceeds expectations. how we create and preserve value
our business model focuses on delivering value across the housebuilding value chain, creating sustainable  
returns for shareholders and making a positive difference in the communities in which we operate. our capability to deliver developments 
of all levels of complexity from standard 
housing to large and highly complex 
london schemes, and our geographical 
portfolio means we can manage risk 
through our diversity. gross margin of at least 20% and roce
