we are ambitious and aim to produce 
four or more pre-clinical candidates every year once the company reaches “steady state”. combined, we believe this makes us uniquely positioned to achieve our goal. we remain on track to complete our first early stage licensing deal in early 2018. 
where beneficial we will continue to seek opportunities to build alliances with organisations that have capabilities 
complementary to our own. this has been an important year in 
delivering that vision. •  disease areas of focus are inflammation, 
neurodegeneration, and opportunistic 
areas (e.g. immuno-oncology, addiction 
and diabetes). post-period end

we are passionate about 
finding better ways of 
discovering drugs. •  c4xd focusses on generating a high
