international 
financial reporting 
standards (ifrss)
these financial statements were prepared 
under ifrss as adopted by the european 
union and interpretations adopted by 
the international accounting standards 
board (iasb). however, given the exceptional circumstances arising at the end of the financial year it has been agreed between 
the executive directors and the remuneration committee that it would be appropriate to defer the allocation of this 
payment until certain matters have been concluded upon. under that law, the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards (ifrss) as adopted by the european union 
and interpretations adopted by the international accounting standard board (iasb). in preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in ifrss 
as adopted by the european union are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. in respect of the year ended 31 december 
2017 an interim dividend of 0.6p per share 
was paid in november 2017 and the 
directors recommend that a final dividend 
of 1.2p per share be paid in june 2018.

it should be noted that due to the 
regulation of various of the subsidiaries 
by their respective financial services 
regulatory body, shareholders holding 
more than 10% may be required to obtain 
prior approval from the relevant regulator 
before being accepted as a shareholder. today stm has trading operations in the united kingdom, gibraltar, jersey, malta 
and spain. finally, i have chaired the board for the past 
three years, having also served as a non-
executive for the four years preceding that, 
and have enjoyed my time working with 
the team to make stm a success. however, 
after seven years of service i have made 
the decision to retire and enjoy more time 
with my family, and i therefore will not be 
standing for re-election at the forthcoming 
agm in may 2018, with my retirement 
becoming effective on 23 may 2018. this 
in turn leaves the board perfectly placed for 
the appointment of one or more uk based 
non-executive directors to reflect the new 
london head office status, with the board 
having already begun the recruitment process. i would like to take this opportunity to 
personally thank all of the group’s directors, 
executive and staff for their efforts in making 
2017 such a success, and will avidly follow 
stm’s continued success in the future. stmgroupplc.com

strong balance sheet: 
cash and cash equivalents balance at £18.4 
million. total revenue across our pensions businesses amounted to £10.2 
million (2016: £9.2 million) and accounted for 47% of total group 
revenue (2016: 52%). to put this in context, for the nine months following the budget, 
new business numbers were 217 rops (2016: 1,224) administered 
by our malta and gibraltar offices and 755 sipps (2016: 162) 
administered from our uk operations. the group specialises 
in the delivery of a wide range of financial service products to professional 
intermediaries and in the administration of assets for international clients in 
relation to retirement, estate and succession planning and wealth structuring. the group continues to expand through the development of additional 
products and services to meet the demands of its expatriate client base. we have delivered a significant amount 
of cost savings by merging administrative 
processes across the group whilst ensuring 
that the existing recurring revenue book 
continues to perform in a predictable and 
solid manner. we were also pleased to make 
the acquisition of harbour pensions limited 
which subsequently completed post year end 
after receiving regulatory approval from the 
malta financial services authority. chief executive

the directors of stm group plc present their 
report for the year to 31 december 2017 
together with the accounts of the group 
and the independent auditors’ report for 
the period. in accordance with the articles of 
association, michael ross riddell retires as 
a director of the company at the annual 
general meeting and will not be offering 
himself for re-election. independent auditors
deloitte llp were appointed as auditors to 
the company during the year and being 
eligible, have expressed their willingness 
to continue in office. it is responsible each year for satisfying itself on 
the independence and objectivity of external 
auditors. the subsidiaries are required to 
identify and manage key risk indicators. • periodic testing to identify vulnerabilities and deliver improvements
• daily back-up and secure storage of all systems to minimise data loss 
• detailed disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place
financial 
risks
the group has exposure to 
the following financial risks:
• credit risk
• liquidity risk
• market risk
• interest rate risk 
• currency risk
these risks are addressed within note 22 of the financial statements
the table below sets out the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group and how they are currently mitigated. we believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. clearly, the integration of the lch acquisition has enabled us 
to restructure the cost base of those businesses acquired and 
ensured that profit margins were enhanced. the 
depreciation and amortisation charge has in turn increased as a 
result of amortising the client portfolio acquired with lch and 
the investment in offices across various jurisdictions. in addition, we continue to seek earnings enhancing 
acquisitions in the rops and uk sipp sector. he is a consultant with pinsent masons, an international 
law firm where he specialises in the development of pensions and related financial services products. the board comprises two executive and three 
independent non-executive directors and 
the board committees are comprised only of 
non-executive directors. the board has established an audit & risk 
committee and a remuneration committee, 
both with formally delegated duties and 
responsibilities. remuneration committee
the remuneration committee meets at least twice in 
each year and at such other times as the chairman of the 
remuneration committee sees fit. the chairman of the 
remuneration committee is appointed by the board.
