company overview continued 
history of the group 
wizz air was founded in 2003 by its current chief executive officer (ceo) józsef váradi and five other 
individuals who recognised a demand for low-cost carriers in cee driven in particular by the accession of ten 
new eu member states on 1 may 2004, eight of which are in cee (the czech republic, estonia, hungary, latvia, 
lithuania, poland, slovakia and slovenia), and the anticipated accession of bulgaria and romania to the eu in 
january 2007. wizz air was established with bases in budapest in hungary and katowice in poland and its 
first flight took off from katowice on 19 may 2004. 
significant milestones in the development of wizz air since its first flight have included: 
fy 2005 
 by the end of its first year of operation, wizz air had established bases in hungary and poland, and started 
flying to eight other european countries (belgium, france, germany, greece, italy, spain, sweden and the 
united kingdom), flying a total of 36 routes by march 2005. fy 2006 
 a third base was established in gdansk, poland. fy 2007 
 a base was established in sofia in bulgaria, ahead of the country joining the eu in january 2007. wizz air 
started flying to croatia, romania and the netherlands, bringing the number of operated routes to 64 at 
the year end.  wizz air’s first aircraft order was placed with airbus to acquire twelve a320 aircraft.  a second order was placed with airbus to acquire a further 20 a320 aircraft.  a third order was placed with airbus to acquire a further 50 a320 aircraft.  a fourth order was placed with airbus to acquire a further 50 (later reduced to 30) a320 aircraft.  0.9 million passengers were carried and wizz air had six aircraft in its fleet at the year end.  2.1 million passengers were carried and wizz air had eight aircraft in its fleet at the year end.  3.1 million passengers were carried and wizz air had ten aircraft in its fleet at the year end.  4.6 million passengers were carried and wizz air had 17 aircraft in its fleet at the year end. ** booked passengers. *** including rented pilots. * f14 and f15 include exceptional items. ** including rented pilots. year-on-year, which translates to an underlying net profit 
margin of 14.3 per cent., a performance which few airlines in europe can match. wizz air now offers 
more than 500 routes from 28 bases, connecting 141 destinations across 42 countries; 
 the delivery of a further twelve brand new a321ceo aircraft, increasing our fleet of airbus a320-family 
aircraft to 79 and the average seat count per aircraft to 190 at the end of the financial year; and 
 driving load factors higher with an impressive 1.9 percentage point increase year-on-year to 90.1 per cent. the trading environment experienced in fy 2017 of very low fares and increasing fuel 
prices unquestionably favoured our ultra-low-cost business model and we were able to increase our growth 
rate, strengthen our number one position in cee and also maintain one of the highest profit margins of any 
european carrier. our strong performance was driven by capacity expansion, higher load factors, higher passenger growth and 
continued improvements to our industry-leading ultra-low-cost base. wizz air holdings plc annual report and accounts 2017 3
