regrettably, this 
process disrupted the organised succession process 
and caused considerable diversion of time and 
energy. the board firmly believes that it followed appropriate 
governance principles, considering shareholders’ and 
other stakeholders’ interests at all times, but it is 
important that our actions are reviewed and 
consideration is given to any lessons to be learned. the uk corporate 
governance code demands that attendance at the 
board and its committees are logged. as detailed in the governance report on page 56,  
the board remains committed to further restoring  
the gender diversity of the board, a process that 
dividend policy
we operate a sustainable, progressive dividend policy, aiming to operate in a target range of 2.5–3.0x  
dividend cover. with a strong global footprint 
and significant infrastructure in a number of 
geographies across the uk, eurozone, us and asia, 
the group is extraordinarily well placed to adapt to 
the consequences of the eventual exit terms. ftse 
russell is also well positioned in emerging markets 
with a strong track record of developing country-
focused benchmarks. a number of indexes and 
partnerships were launched over the year including 
in malaysia, china, taiwan and saudi arabia. confidence in our outlook led us to set financial 
targets at an investor update event in june, which  
will deliver growth in group ebitda margin to c.55% 
by 2019. 
as a leading financial markets infrastructure group, 
we have continued to grow our global footprint, 
including strengthening our presence in asia and  
in the united states. sign-off for the strategic report is provided in the 
directors’ report on page 98.

shareholder information
a glossary of terms used in this report and other 
information for shareholders. the group’s principal foreign exchange revenue exposure arises 
from translating our european based euro and us based usd 
reporting businesses into sterling. consistent with the group’s capital allocation 
framework, we conducted an on-market share 
buyback of £200 million, an amount broadly 
equivalent to the return we would have made had the 
merger with deutsche börse proceeded as planned. need help? we worked hard to find the 
appropriate solutions to the competition review. it will never be possible for all 
of that information to be in the public domain, much 
as some may wish it to be. the selected charities focus on helping young  
people to develop vital life skills and we encourage 
employees to become actively involved in their work 
through paid volunteering days. throughout the merger discussions, the executive 
management remained focused on the performance 
of our business divisions, through organic and 
inorganic growth, as was evident from the acquisition 
of the yield book and citi fixed income indices 
business. the transaction, which completed at the 
end of august, enhances and complements the 
group’s information services data and analytics 
offering and will allow ftse russell to capitalise 
further on key industry trends. david warren discusses the opportunities that  
mifid ii presents for the group as the only financial 
markets infrastructure business operating on  
an open access basis elsewhere in this report. indexes are firmly embedded across the investment 
process and ftse russell has the ability to provide 
customers with a comprehensive product range and 
a deeper data and analytics offering. followed by more detail on each of our 
divisions, our performance, how we consider our wider 
responsibilities and the principal risks that could affect 
our business. the group continues to execute on its 
strategy, delivering best-in-class capabilities, 
driving global growth and developing our 
partnership approach. we introduced a new leadership team, created  
a more nimble and product-driven delivery 
capability, and improved our collaboration with 
innovation teams, all with the aim of better  
serving existing and new customers
 – lseg business services limited, our shared  
services company, has broadened into services  
for corporate functions
further information
more detailed information on the performance  
of our business segments can be found on  
pages 19–33. on 
behalf of all our stakeholders and partners, the 
group continues to argue strongly for a defined 
implementation period and the minimisation of the 
fragmentation of systems and processes designed to 
make the financial markets more efficient, stable and

termination of its attempted merger with deutsche 
börse following the european commission’s 
prohibition decision. lseg has always been committed to maintaining 
excellent relationships with all of its stakeholders, 
including the regulators in its significant markets, 
and taking into account all of the relevant factors,  
the board concluded that it could not meet the late 
stage request from the eu commission for 
divestment of a key italian business. following the uk’s decision to leave the eu, the group 
continues to ensure that our businesses are well 
prepared for any eventual outcome. glossary 162
