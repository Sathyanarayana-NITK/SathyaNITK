financial statements additional information governance strategic report business model and strategy
over the last five years, bpha has 
transformed its financial performance. accordingly the finance & treasury committee was established in 
2015 under the chairmanship of dr martin hurst, a then recently 
appointed non-executive member of the board. in addition to the appointment of paul high, i was delighted to 
welcome jill ainscough to the board as chair of the remuneration 
and nominations committee, replacing neil. ian ailles has agreed 
to serve as chair of the audit and risk committee. ian will succeed 
peter male and peter will remain as senior independent director. we supported the executive in committing 
to investment to support new ways of working, including a greater 
emphasis on remote and flexible working and in investing in it to 
drive efficiencies. we have set out in these financial statements details of bpha’s 
business model and strategy, how we are investing in people to 
build capability and our development programme. as detailed on page 7, we have established 
a new business unit operational model that has been designed 
to be both scalable and modular. it will bring greater focus and 
transparency to service delivery, the performance of our assets 
and the overall operational efficiency of the association. growth, innovation and efficiency 
bpha continues to build and maintain quality homes 
and thriving communities by being increasingly efficient 
and always considering those we house. we provide homes for 
people at all life stages from starter homes, family homes 
through to a range of housing options for older people. we are committed to building at least 500 new 
homes a year and are one of the top 25 developing 
housing associations. i am writing this statement in the immediate aftermath of the 
tragic event of the grenfell tower fire in which so many people 
have sadly lost their lives. report and financial

bpha’s success has helped attract  
good people and good people are  
key to continued success. there will be a need to review the 
information that emerges from the inquiry as that unfolds; in the 
meantime working with fire service representatives we have 
looked again at bpha tenants’ safety and the fire precaution 
measures that are in place in the tower blocks that bpha owns. tenants’ safety continues to be our number one priority. ! everyone here at bpha extends their 
sympathy to all involved. i should like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone at bpha for their contribution to this success and 
in delivering service for the benefit of all our customers. fundamental to all of this are the many 
different people who play key roles within bpha. our vision and mission will only be achieved if we have the 
ambition, strength and capability to be adaptable and resilient 
along the way. 2. lease and partnership management
