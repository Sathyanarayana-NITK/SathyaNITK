they bring, respectively, in-depth 
ﬁnancial and scientiﬁc expertise, as well as 
signiﬁcant international business experience 
to our discussions. this enabled me to lead  
the important process of selecting david 
brennan’s successor. his was a key appointment at an important 
time for astrazeneca. the board is certain 
that pascal’s leadership qualities, combined 
with his strategic thinking and extensive 
dear shareholder
i am glad i was able to meet a number of 
you in april 2012 when astrazeneca held its 
annual general meeting in london. additionally, our diabetes alliance 
with bms is strengthened by the inclusion  
of the amylin portfolio and the approval  
of forxiga in europe. it is our  
ﬁrst priority. astrazeneca has a unique combination  
of scientiﬁc capabilities in small molecules, 
biologics, immunotherapies and antibody 
engineering. this puts us in a strong 
position to develop the targeted novel 
medicines and combinations (such as 
drug-antibody conjugates) required to meet 
patient needs in the future. revenue rose by 
4% in emerging markets
>  some $4.5 billion of 
revenue decline was 
related to loss of 
exclusivity on several 
brands in the portfolio. 2
  share repurchases in 2012, net of proceeds from the issue of share capital equal  
to $429 million, were $2,206 million. 3
  share repurchases in 2011, net of proceeds from the issue of share capital equal  
to $409 million, were $5,606 million. 4
  share repurchases in 2010, net of proceeds from the issue of share capital equal  
to $494 million, were $2,110 million. even with moderate vaccination uptake, the uk alone could see around a 40% drop  
in the number of people affected. that would mean at least 11,000 fewer hospitalisations as a result of inﬂuenza and around  
2,000 fewer deaths a year. the world’s population is growing 
and ageing. for example, we are the 
second largest pharmaceutical company 
in china by sales. you will ﬁnd

how did we do in delivering our strategy in 2012? when i joined the board, i was pleased that 
both graham chipchase and geneviève 
berger also became non-executive 
directors. also in april 2012, we said farewell to 
michele hooper who stood down from  
the board. the world pharmaceutical market is still 
growing and underlying demographic 
trends remain favourable to long-term 
industry growth. however, many of the 
drivers of demand and supply in the 
industry are under pressure. r&d 
costs have risen signiﬁcantly over the past 
decade, while industry-wide probability of 
success continues to decline. i ﬁrmly believe that it is the  
path we need to take if we are to remain 
competitive and return to growth.
