in london, helical is building up a 
portfolio of multi-tenanted office 
buildings in the tech belt locations of 
farringdon, the old street roundabout 
and whitechapel and also in west 
london from chiswick to shepherd’s 
bush. 11
drury lane & dryden 
street
covent garden wc2
the existing buildings, which are in 
office and retail use, sit on an island site 
of approximately 0.5 acres. approximately 
half of the site, adjacent to dryden 
street, sits within the covent garden 
conservation area. each private, 
age-exclusive retirement community is centred 
around a residents’ clubhouse, and features 
many amenities including an indoor pool and 
gym, landscaped gardens, bar, restaurant and 
library. with intelligent stock selection, 
we aim to maximise returns by 
development and refurbishment 
as well as through significant 
asset management initiatives. by owning these “clusters” or 
“villages” of office buildings it has a 
portfolio of assets with multiple lease 
events leading to ongoing asset 
management opportunities. companies have access to a 
deep and highly skilled talent pool in a 
cost effective location both for the 
employer and the employee. all other assets 
currently held are regarded as non-core 
and we will seek to continue to exit those 
assets as the opportunities to do so arise. at 25 charterhouse square 
ec1, refurbishment works on 
this 43,600 sq ft building were 
completed in march 2017 with 
50% 
of the office space (18,725 sq ft) 
let at £75 psf. at the bower ec1
58,90 7 sq ft 
of phase 2, the tower, was pre-let 
to wework in november 2016. annual office take up 
is consistently in excess of 1m sq ft with 
high profile new occupiers coming to the 
city on a frequent basis. a planning 
consent has been implemented to increase 
the floor space on the site by 116,000 sq ft, 
to refurbish existing areas and significantly 
upgrade the public realm with the creation 
of a new pedestrian street. helical plc is a uk focused 
property investment and  
development company

pictured 31 booth street, manchester. our london portfolio remains 
reversionary with further value to be 
created through the completion of our 
redevelopment and refurbishment 
programme, letting vacant space and 
upcoming rent reviews. through intelligent 
property selection, development and active asset 
management, we drive capital and rental income 
growth. the 
london 
market
in our judgement, the london commercial 
property market currently provides the 
best source of potential capital profits 
and we expect this to remain the case for 
the foreseeable future, notwithstanding 
the risks associated with our exit from 
the european union and other potential 
headwinds. in order for helical to generate capital 
profits the company needs to identify 
those areas where it believes tenant 
demand is, or will become, strong and 
to source opportunities in those areas 
at an appropriate entry price. the company also seeks to expand its 
profitability by taking on additional 
schemes in central london either by 
co-investment or by forward selling/
funding them, to allow for the generation 
of profit shares and development 
management fees but with reduced 
balance sheet exposure. our portfolio is primarily targeted toward 
mixed used assets in london, offices in manchester 
and a diverse portfolio of logistics assets. regional highlights 
asset recycling providing stronger focus  
on manchester offices and logistics units. 8
