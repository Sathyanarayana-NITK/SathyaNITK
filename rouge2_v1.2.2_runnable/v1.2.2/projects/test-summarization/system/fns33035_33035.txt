financial headlines the year
this has been a really good year for bt. we are
recognising the efforts of our people in meeting bt’s
performance targets through awarding them 2% of the
pre-tax proﬁts, £36 million, in the form of bt shares. demerger of mmo

on 19 november 2001, we completed the demerger
of mmo

, comprising what were bt’s wholly-owned
mobile assets in europe: o

uk (formerly known as
bt cellnet), o
2
communications (ireland) (formerly
known as esat digifone), telfort mobiel, viag interkom,
manx telecom and genie. in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we disposed of a
number of non-core investments, including stakes
in bskyb, mediaset, blu and smartone. the result of a recent
valuation of the main bt pension scheme, carried out
by the independent actuary appointed by the scheme
trustees, showed a funding deﬁcit of £2.1 billion. third, we have rigorous
ﬁnancial discipline. being trustworthy means consistently delivering on
our promises. the deﬁnition,
reconciliation and reasons for disclosing ebitda
are discussed in the financial review. in this annual report, references to ‘‘bt group’’, ‘‘bt’’, ‘‘the group’’, ‘‘the company’’, ‘‘we’’ or ‘‘our’’ are to bt group plc (which
includes the continuing activities of british telecommunications plc) and its subsidiaries and lines of business, or any of them as the
context may require. the fundamentals of our strategy are:
&
customer satisfaction
&
ﬁnancial discipline
&
broadband – at the heart of bt
&
value-added solutions for multi-site organisations with european
operations
&
a clear network strategy, with uniﬁed management of all uk networks
&
a clear strategy for each customer group, including new services and
brand extension
&
diverse, skilled and motivated people. we believe the company is well placed – ﬁnancially,
operationally and managerially – to meet new
challenges and to seize new opportunities. for example:
& consumers and businesses are now more satisﬁed
with the way we provide and repair their services,
as shown by our satisfaction surveys
& packages such as bt together, which has
ten million residential customers, have been a major
success story.
