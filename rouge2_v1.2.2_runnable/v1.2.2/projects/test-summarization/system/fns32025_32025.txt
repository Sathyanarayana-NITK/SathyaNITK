during the year, strong performances from 
food and fuels more than offset the challenging 
conditions experienced in the feeds market. is the group susceptible to weather and 
commodity price changes? with an oil business 
that focuses on heating oil in the winter, cold 
weather will benefit the division, but an ability 
to sell a range of oil products has demonstrated 
some effective mitigation in recent milder conditions. in fuels, we have a proven depot operating model 
and have demonstrated that the business can 
deliver a solid result even when market conditions 
are adverse. volumes were robust and the 
mill developments in the north and cheshire, 
completed during the year, have strengthened 
our operating platform. with a heritage in the 
agricultural sector, established in 1871, the group has over 140 
years’ experience in adding value to our customers’ businesses. service
