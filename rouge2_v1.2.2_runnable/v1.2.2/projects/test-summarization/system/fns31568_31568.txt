our opportunity for geographic expansion 
continues to broaden; our sales partners are highly engaged 
and effective, continuing to deliver long term, valuable 
customers; and we are investing in educating developers, 
partners and customers on the power of rpa and the required 
skills to take advantage of it. our rapidly growing technology 
alliance program, which increasingly positions blue prism as the 
‘operating system’ for digital workforce deployments, presents 
us with further opportunities to develop new revenue streams. as a result, the company 
was also able to generate £16m in incremental revenue from just one  
single process. market review
supported by board level conversations between global 
consulting firms and their clients, intelligent automation,  
the digital enterprise, robotics and the future of work are all 
themes that rpa plays well to, and this is driving the market 
into global expansion. after deploying blue prism’s rpa, blind 
workers could complete tasks in their entirety 4 to 6 times faster and  
3 times more efficiently than before, for an estimated cost saving of  
nearly 65 per cent. company overview

market overview
delivering 
tomorrow’s 
digital workforce 
worldwide
we believe that the combination of intelligent automation 
targeted at transformational change, supported by technical 
partners and a robust methodology is appealing to both our 
distribution partners and our customers, and along with our 
public status and strengthened balance sheet, sets us apart 
from other rpa vendors. such rapid growth and adoption – and the 
recognition of the value rpa can provide at the enterprise 
level – stems from an increasing demand at board level to 
introduce automation technologies into their business. japan is 
culturally pre-disposed towards automation, based on 
positive experience in manufacturing (especially robotics 
in automotive) and the high value its society places 
culturally on the quality of products and relationships. ”

about blue prism
the group’s enterprise-grade 
software enables the automation of 
manual, rules-based, administrative 
processes to create a more agile, cost 
effective and accurate back-office. blue prism’s rpa software delivers  
the world’s most successful digital 
workforce in execution for our 
customers and has executed over  
1bn transactions. the blue prism digital 
workforce provides businesses with an 
enterprise-strength technology solution 
that supports the pace of business 
change and evolving industry 
requirements. the vision & the reality the digital workforce
blue prism group plc, a 
uk-headquartered global 
software company, is a 
leader in robotic process 
automation (“rpa”),  
which enables blue-chip 
organisations to create a 
digital workforce powered 
by blue prism’s software 
robots that are trained to 
automate routine 
administrative tasks. in a perfect world, people interact 
with customers, have ideas and make 
improvements, whilst it implements 
business rules and logic, bulk processing 
and consistent decisions. in the real 
world, it has not traditionally been 
capable of adapting or developing at 
the speed of business needs. so people 
end up filling the gaps between 
systems and processes – taking them 
away from the really valuable work. with blue prism, people can get on 
with valuable customer interaction, 
making judgements and improving the 
business. what is rpa? how? what is blue prism rpa? the significant sales 
momentum we have seen this year and the 609 software deals 
we have signed - more than 3 times the number signed in the 
prior year - underscores our confidence in our product and the 
market’s readiness to engage in the potential of rpa. as we move in to the new financial year, we will continue to 
focus on the many ways in which this commercial momentum  
is being driven. the group has had a strong start to the first quarter of fy2018  
and as such now expect revenues for the full financial year to be 
comfortably ahead of existing market expectations. funded by 
the anticipated net proceeds of the placing we have announced 
today, the additional investment planned for fy2018 to support 
our global growth is expected to increase our revenue growth in 
the next financial year. ijoma maluza has joined the 
board as cfo and will continue to build on the strong 
platform established by gary. in particular, we have strengthened the 
management team with key appointments including shail 
khiyara, chief marketing officer; pat geary who stepped 
into the newly-created role of chief evangelist; and nicola 
bergstrom who joined blue prism to lead human 
resources. risk description blue prism group plc annual report and accounts 2017

non-independent, non-executive chairman
jason has been commercialising ai 
for over 25 years. he has a phd from 
university college london and was co-
founder of ucl’s intelligent systems 
lab. essentially, rpa replicates human action. it will execute the most tedious and repetitive 
activities with precision and without interruption. as such, risk can be mitigated 
significantly, whilst security is strengthened from minimising 
human fraud, error, intrusion and malpractice. this has proven effective in 
driving increased adoption in the legacy direct accounts.
