while this report focuses on value generation for our shareholders, it also demonstrates 
how we interact with all of our stakeholders. in producing this report we have: built upon the key changes introduced previously; and 
developed it in line with the evolving practices in integrated reporting. our future reports 
will seek to keep up with these new developments and achieve our aim of continually 
improving our stakeholder communications. the steps we have taken in this report:
• our business model continues to evolve to provide greater clarity on how we create 
value in the short, medium and long term. whilst the depreciation 
in sterling following the eu referendum and other cost 
headwinds, such as the introduction of the national living 
wage, clearly impacted earnings, the underlying business 
performance was positive and cash flow was robust. gross margin of 51.0% was 220 
basis points lower than the prior year, predominantly 
due to the impact of the movement in foreign currency 
exchange rates. the increase in cost of goods associated with the 
depreciation in sterling had an adverse impact of circa  
£14m (pre-mitigation) which more than accounted for 
the decline in profit for the year. net debt* at the end of the year was up 
£38.0m at £85.9m, with a net debt to underlying ebitda 
ratio* of 0.8:1 versus 0.4:1 in the prior year. committed to

halfords is the uk’s leading retailer of motoring, 
cycling and leisure products and through 
halfords autocentres, is also one of the uk’s 
leading independent operators in vehicle 
servicing, maintenance and repairs. excluding the acquired businesses, lfl group online sales grew 11.5%. we applied our capital allocation policy consistently: 
firstly, by further investment in our colleagues and our 
infrastructure; secondly, with an increased ordinary 
dividend; thirdly, with two complementary acquisitions – 
100% of t redz and wheelies in may 2016 and a minority 
stake in tyresonthedrive.com in january 2017; and, 
thereafter, by paying a special dividend of 10 pence per 
share in february 2017. progress was thus made towards 
our debt target of 1 times ebitda. profit after tax for the year was £56.4m 
(fy16: £63.5m). . . . . introduction 
to halfords
for 125 years halfords has been  
synonymous with travel. partially offsetting this was strong growth in dash cams, 
in-car connectivity equipment and car cleaning products. travel solutions lfl revenues increased 7.9%, driven by 
robust growth in roof bars and boxes, cycle carriers and 
child seats; all of which benefit from our market-leading 
positions and friendly, highly-trained fitters. the like-for-like growth in retail was driven by strong 
performances across each of the sub-categories of 
bikes, parts, accessories and clothing (“pacs”) and 
repair. halfords annual report 2017.indd   4 07/06/2017   16:36:02 slugline

*  alternative performance measures (“apms”): measures with this symbol are defined in the key performance indicators table on page 18. we have provided more detail on the outputs 
of our business model. • we have increased the signposting and consistency between sections to show how 
they connect and interact. • we have included more metrics in the corporate social responsibility section. this icon is used to indicate content on the outputs of the business model. underlying ebitda* was 
down 5.1% to £108.7m. lfl 
growth of 3.1% reflected motoring lfl of 2.0% and 
cycling lfl of 5.1%. underlying 
ebitda further removes 
depreciation and 
amortisation. by following an integrated reporting model, we aim 
to show how our competitive advantage is sustainable in the short, medium, and long term. overview
since setting out our moving up a gear strategy 18 
months ago, excellent progress has been made across 
each of the five key pillars that underpin the strategy. performance
we achieved solid sales growth from our motoring 
activities, in both retail and autocentres, and strong 
growth in cycling where we continued to register 
market share gains and can uniquely offer customers 
the full range: from children’s balance bikes to high 
end performance road bikes. investment in our colleagues continues to reap benefits 
and i am pleased that halfords was, for the 4th year in a 
row, awarded an improved place in the list of t op 30 best 
big companies t o work for. in line with our policy 
of paying an increasing ordinary dividend, the board has 
recommended a final dividend of 11.68 pence per share, 
payable in august 2017 which would result in a total full-year 
ordinary dividend of 17.51 pence per share, up 3.0% over 
the previous year. underlying 
profit before tax* was £75.4m and underlying basic 
earnings per share* was 30.3p, down 7.5% and 8.7% 
respectively. including the special dividend of 10 pence per 
share paid in february 2017, the full-year dividend per 
share was 27.51 pence, an increase of 61.8% on the  
prior year. cycling sales improved by 5.1% on a lfl basis and 
18.2% on a total sales basis.
