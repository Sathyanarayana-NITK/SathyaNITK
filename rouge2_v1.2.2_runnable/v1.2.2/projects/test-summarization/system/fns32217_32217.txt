over the last few years the group has 
been developing a growing pipeline of 
prospective business. bringing a number 
of these prospects on stream during the 
year, as well as a keen focus on 
maintaining high-levels of service for 
existing introducers, allowed the business 
to grow over the period. there were challenging times with the 
changes in the buy-to-let regulations, 
followed by the slow down post eu 
referendum. uls t echnology annual report & accounts 2017

our vision
to become the leading service provider  
of technology comparison solutions to  
the legal services, financial services and 
property sectors. revenue
£22.3m
revenue is generated principally 
from the completion of conveyancing 
cases and also the associated sales 
of searches and id checks. it 
has increased its market share 
and has plenty of scope to 
maintain this momentum via 
organic and acquisitive growth. despite this, uls has 
continued its momentum 
and grown its share of 
conveyancing completions. although uls held no disproportionate 
exposure to buy-to-let, the overall activity 
levels in the market were somewhat muted 
following the rush that led up to stamp duty 
changes for landlords. uls has a fairly typical exposure to all three 
segments and therefore has not unduly 
been affected by these movements. ebitda (underlying)
