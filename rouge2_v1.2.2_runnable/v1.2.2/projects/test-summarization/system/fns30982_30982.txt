the group’s ﬁnancial performance demonstrates the encouraging progress in rebalancing the business by growing revenues
in the consultancy services division which generates greater yields. we achieved a second
successive year of cash conversion in excess of 100% of ebitda in 2017, enabling us to reduce net debt from £7.4m at the
end of 2015 to £1.6m at the end of 2017, with the net debt/ebitda ratio at the end of year improved to 0.7x (2016: 2.0x). divisional performance

the group recognises its corporate social responsibilities and reports on these in a separate statement of social,
environmental and ethical policies on pages 18 and 19. this statement covers the group’s employment policies,
environmental policy and health and safety policy. results are communicated to staﬀ with
proposed actions to address any identiﬁed issues. where appropriate these
objectives are linked to proﬁtability. parity consultancy services
focussed on dynamic, high 
growth services with large, 
long-term contracts at higher
margins, particularly data 
solutions – enabling more 
eﬀective decision making. strategy
importantly, the management team has begun further
activity to leverage the consulting services side of the
business, to drive operating margin improvement. the
board will seek to accelerate growth in the consulting
business, whilst sustaining investment in the traditional
professional services side of the business. key relationships held by the business for many years such
as the education and skills funding agency, british
american tobacco and the ministry of defence, continued
to widen and deepen, and we were able to announce post-
close extensions on these contracts. each and every
time the quality of service and the
response times have been
excellent.”

introduction
2017 was an important year for parity, one in which good
operational management created continuing
improvement despite the risk and headwinds of the
ir35 regulatory changes to the taxation of intermediaries
which oﬀered a signiﬁcant challenge to our industry. strategically, parity believes it has established a clear point
of diﬀerentiation from competitors due to the synergy
between its consulting and professional services divisions. new clients have
been developed such as primark, the high street retailer,
and this together with the combination of good
relationship management and increasing traction from
new relationships underpin the outlook for 2018.
discontinued operations
the ﬁnal legacy from the previous strategy is the group’s
bespoke 3d development arm, inition which has for some
time been a non-core asset. our focus in
2018 is on demonstrating that the consulting arm, working
in tandem with the recruitment division, can deliver
sustained growth and proﬁtability improvements, to the
beneﬁt of our shareholders. it has been held for sale and
accounted for as a discontinued operation in these
accounts. taxation
the tax credit on continuing proﬁt before tax was £0.53m
(2016: tax charge of £0.07m) mainly representing a deferred
tax credit in respect of consultancy services. the division
previously carried forward an unrecognised deferred tax
asset in respect of deductible timing diﬀerences that had not
been recognised due to historic ﬁnancial performance. the group did not provide for corporation tax payable in
2017 due to the utilisation of group relief and the
availability of carried forward deductible timing
diﬀerences and tax losses. in early 2018, mavenlink published a report in conjunction
with research now, detailing the results of a survey of 576
executives (director and above) from service-centric
companies in north america, europe and asia-paciﬁc. discontinued operations
inition was held for sale during 2017 and accordingly its
results are presented as discontinued. at the year end, creditor
days were 28 days (2016: 26 days). the current
facility, which has been in place since 2010, was renewed
on 1 september 2016, and runs until the end of 2018, at
which point pnc have indicated a willingness to renew the
facility. parity group plc
