strategic report what makes ferguson a great business
 
we operate in attractive,  
fragmented markets
as the largest distributor of plumbing and 
heating products in the usa, we hold  
leading market positions in the majority of  
our businesses. 27%
hvac is generating 27 per cent  
of its revenue from online orders
11 another good  
year for the group
in 2016/17 ferguson delivered good revenue and trading proﬁt 
growth supporting our commitment to improve shareholder returns. source: united nations department of 
economic and social affairs. source: national association  
of realtors. source: the conference board. source: us department of  
housing and urban development. acquiring regional  
or local competitors where we can rapidly 
integrate them into our supply chain makes  
bolt-on acquisitions highly attractive. other growth opportunities lie in  
developing new adjacent businesses such  
as facilities supply and b2c e-commerce  
where we can utilise our existing skills, 
capabilities and infrastructure. growth will continue to be 
enhanced through both organic 
business development and 
targeted acquisitions that add to our 
geographical capabilities, expand 
our customer base and bring 
talented associates into the business. our dedication to provide unrivalled service  
is the key ferguson differentiator and it  
will continue to be our focus by providing  
the best trained workforce in the industry. over the following pages we celebrate our  
new name by focusing on the strengths and 
opportunities inherent in our us business which we 
believe will generate sustainable proﬁtable growth  
and strong returns for our shareholders. 3
there are only three national  
competitors with a market share

what makes ferguson a great business
 
we work in an industry with compelling 
growth opportunities
our strong service ethic combined with  
scale advantages in logistics, supply chain  
and technology, means we have consistently 
gained market share to generate strong  
proﬁtable growth. we strongly believe we will gain 
market share and grow proﬁtably 
in this attractive market. in particular, 
his tenure as chief executive for the 
last eight years has been outstanding, 
achieving sustained rapid growth and 
record trading margins. it’s also about the ferguson culture  
that puts people and customers ﬁrst, resulting  
in the highest levels of quality, service and efficiency  
for over sixty years. our customers rely on us every day and our 
specialist products and services are used in almost 
every stage of commercial, residential, industrial 
and municipal development. these markets are typically  
highly fragmented with few large  
competitors and we compete with many  
small local distributors. consequently, there continues to  
be excellent opportunities to grow our  
business geographically, particularly in large  
metropolitan areas across the usa. *** headline earnings per share is an apm, see page 12 and note 2 on pages 91 and 92 for further information. our new name recognises the size and  
importance of ferguson in the usa which today 
generates nearly 90 per cent of the group’s  
trading proﬁt. page 19
