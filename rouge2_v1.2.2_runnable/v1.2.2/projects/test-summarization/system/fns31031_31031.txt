“ my guess is that the biggest challenge for 
marketers this year will be gdpr. rob brings a wealth of both media 
and senior board-level experience to 
ebiquity. the year saw a scaling up of 
our mpo effectiveness services in 
continental europe and our mpo 
practice in apac. the actions that have been taken in 
2017, has positioned the business for 
faster revenue growth in 2018 and 
beyond. with an expectation of a 
turnaround in performance in the us in 
2018, together with continued revenue 
growth outside of the us, we remain 
confident of delivering against the 
financial goals we set out in the 
growth acceleration plan. while our financial performance was 
held back by disappointing results in the 
us, we achieved important milestones 
on our multi-year transformational 
journey. we have a clear, focused and 
differentiated destination and are 
implementing the relevant changes to 
get these, now and going forward.”

period in the prior year. since 2016, there has been substantial 
progress in defining our strategic 
direction and delivering a simplified

ideally suited to our business as well as 
to today’s opportunities and 
challenges. today, there are 
dozens of different links in the

estimates as many as 50. this 
poses obvious challenges to 
marketers looking to run 
impactful campaigns, but the 
new ecosystem also offers the 
potential for transformational 
returns for those who get it right. today’s marketers 
operate in a paradoxical 
environment, where it’s never 
been more challenging and at the 
same time never more possible to 
use data to drive evidence-based 
decision-making. annual

performance overview
revenues for the year to 31 december 
2017 grew 4.6% to £87.4 million. with 
the majority of revenue denominated 
in non-sterling currencies, revenue was 
boosted by sterling being on average 
weaker against the euro and the dollar 
in 2017 than in 2016. in total, currency 
movements benefited revenue by 3.4%, 
with acquisitions further increasing 
revenue by 0.4%. in fact, it’s our declared purpose. this means enabling marketers to work 
with their partners to choose the level of 
transparency that’s right for them. this is how we empower our clients to be sure 
that every marketing decision leads to enhanced 
effectiveness. to better return on investment. it means subjecting marketing 
performance to ever-greater scrutiny. we are positioning ebiquity to become 
the preferred, independent adviser to 
marketers at world-leading brands. this aligns our business 
with the challenges that our clients 
face, and it follows the planned 
divestment of the advertising 
intelligence business. ebiquity is now well-positioned at the 
heart of the marketing industry.
