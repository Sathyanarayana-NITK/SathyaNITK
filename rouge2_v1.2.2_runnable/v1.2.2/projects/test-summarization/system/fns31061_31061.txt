governance
corporate governance report
board meetings and attendance
the board aims to meet at least quarterly, with at least two meetings held in person (once during the budget-setting process 
and once mid-year). two in-person board meetings were held 
during 2017. the table below shows the number of and attendance at both board and committee meetings during the year. board papers are circulated before board meetings 
in sufficient time to enable their review and consideration 
in advance of meetings. the 
board, however, recognizes the 
importance of the principles set out in 
the code and remains committed to the 
maintenance of high standards of 
corporate governance. after due consideration, the board 
seeks to apply those aspects of the 
code as far as it considers appropriate 
for a business of this size and nature. it sets strategic aims and oversees implementation 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls, ensuring 
that only acceptable risks are taken. the board has agreed the schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision, which includes ensuring that the necessary 
financial and human resources are in place to meet 
obligations to shareholders and others. nico 
has a bsc degree in aerospace engineering from the école 
centrale de paris, an msc in aeronautics & astronautics from 
mit, and an mba from insead. steve has an mba from stanford and an meng/ba hons from 
st. john’s college, cambridge. simon is a chartered accountant 
who trained with kpmg, and holds a degree in accountancy 
from the university of birmingham. michael has an meng from imperial college, an mba from 
stanford as an arjay miller scholar, and was awarded a
