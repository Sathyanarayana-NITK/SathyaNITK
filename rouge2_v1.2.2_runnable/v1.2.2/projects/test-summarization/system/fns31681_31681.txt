the private sector share of this market has 
developed through successful outsourcing of 
services over the last 20 years and this trend is 
expected to continue. our credibility as the provider 
of choice has never been stronger and we 
continue our successful growth strategy with 
a confident outlook. a number 
of organic growth projects and potential 
bolt-on acquisitions had been identified 
prior to the placing. as a result we have improved our 
capacity during the year which has led to 
an increase in all key financial kpis and our 
underlying ebitda. we believe in opportunity and have developed 
an enviable reputation as a leading provider 
and organiser of modern apprenticeships 
within exciting projects across the uk. these are high cost services 
where we aim for an intensive period of care and 
a strict timetable that delivers results at a fair price 
to commissioners. through acquisition and the development of 
established apprenticeship providers caretech 
has embraced the opportunity to capitalise on 
this change and to work closely with government 
agencies to improve the quality and skill base of 
our national workforce. the introduction of the apprenticeship levy 
has caused a declined in companies offering 
apprenticeships. focusing on the high acuity social care 
population we support children and adults 
through solutions that are both individual 
and tailor made to each of our service users. our core services provide for adults with 
learning disabilities, individuals who have 
or are recovering from mental illness, people 
with autistic spectrum disorder, people who 
have one or more physical impairments and 
provide care and rehabilitation for men with 
acquired brain injury (“abi”). our children services cover assessment, 
residential care, education and fostering 
options, including specialist provision for very 
complex young people. we carefully and 
professionally support any child irrespective 
of their reasons for being in public care. (v) overall capacity has increased by 215 reflecting 
the net of 161 additional beds in reconfigured 
services and new services, 87 beds from the 
acquisition of selborne care, 36 beds 
withdrawn for reconfiguration, and three places 
more in small supported living packages. find out more online:
