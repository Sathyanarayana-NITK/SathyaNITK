the business made good strategic progress, commencing the 
rollout of an entirely new trading platform, establishing its limited 
risk trading account globally, further developing its international 
offices and launching an exciting new low-cost passive investment 
product in the uk. the recent increase in regulatory concerns around retail leveraged 
trading is perhaps no surprise. we have a clear vision at ig: to be a global leader in retail trading 
and investments. chairman’s statement
in my third year as chairman of ig, i am pleased to report that the company delivered 
another year of strong growth, leading to record revenue and profits, in a relatively quiet 
period for financial markets. ig group holdings plc

‘it was an interesting and challenging 
year in terms of global news flow, 
especially in the political and 
regulatory sphere, but the year turned 
out to be one of the least volatile in 
financial markets for decades. of course, the changing face of regulation is dominating the 
backdrop for ig’s core product at the moment. the regulatory 
situation is in a state of flux, and it could take some time for clarity 
to be available in all markets. like any growing profitable industry, 
competition has increased in recent years. remuneration
we seek to maintain a remuneration structure which creates a 
balance between rewarding performance against annual objectives 
and the delivery of long-term stakeholder value. last year we 
carried out a series of adjustments across the organisation to 
ensure we can continue to motivate, recruit and retain high-quality 
people at all levels to deliver against our short-term and long-term 
priorities. a sophisticated 
application and onboarding process then ensures that only 
appropriate clients proceed – gaining access to the products and 
educational materials that fit their objectives, knowledge and 
capital resources. our operating model and risk management strategy have been 
thoroughly tested over time, and have proved highly resilient in 
a wide range of real-life scenarios. we’re the no.1 provider of cfds and spread betting worldwide

, with offices located in 15 countries and operations in a further two. (2)
a history of  
creating solutions 
innovation has been at the heart of our business since we began life 
in 1974. as the uk’s original financial spread betting provider, we 
introduced a completely new, accessible way for people to trade on 
gold – by defining it as an index. share trading launched in australia. 2015 –  sunday trading launched. board
as previously communicated, paul mainwaring joined as cfo 
designate on 11 july 2016 and was appointed to the board on  
20 july 2016. in september, sam tymms was appointed as chairman 
of the board risk committee, replacing stephen hill, who remains a 
member of the committee. the intention again this year is to put every board director up for 
re-election at the agm, in compliance with paragraph b.7.1 of the uk 
corporate governance code. andy green

our business
introducing ig
ig exists to empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to access opportunities in financial markets. operating globally under the ig brand, and in the us as nadex, we’re the trusted platform provider for over 185,000 clients. therefore, 
we recently refreshed the values of the group, to ensure all of our 
people understand what binds the company together and what has 
been at the heart of our success over many years. we express our 
values as:
• champion the client
• lead the way
• love what we do
by staying true to these values, i believe the company will emerge 
from the current uncertainty in an even stronger position within 
its core industry and as a credible insurgent within the broader 
investments space. on behalf of the board, i want to thank them sincerely for 
their ongoing efforts. our excellence in technology and our people’s unswerving 
commitment to fair client outcomes will serve us well as the 
uncertainty clears, and i believe that ig will come out of this period 
as an even stronger player. using our cutting-edge platforms and apps, our clients 
place almost 8 million transactions a month with us. our innovations have included the first online 
dealing platform for financial spread betting in 1998 and the 
first trading app for apple watch in 2015. this year we delivered 
a completely new trading platform that is beginning to greatly 
enhance the trading experience for our clients. an intuitive, 
customisable interface offers straightforward functionality for 
the less-experienced trader, while those with more demanding 
requirements have access to a range of advanced functions. using a centralised marketing strategy, we connect with clients in 156 countries – efficiently and cost-effectively. against 
this backdrop i am pleased that ig 
once again delivered record revenue 
and profits.’

in line with the previously stated intention to pay out, as an ordinary 
dividend, approximately 70% of the group’s annual earnings, the 
board is recommending a final dividend of 22.88 pence per share, 
taking the full-year dividend to 32.3 pence per share, 2.9% ahead of 
the prior year. i am, however, pleased that the 
management and the entire ig team have continued to concentrate 
on developing the business, while engaging constructively with 
regulators and innovating to further improve client outcomes. unfortunately a number 
of these competitors have been taking a very short-term approach 
to this market and have been targeting inappropriate clients. ig has always sought to operate to the 
highest standards, and we are determined to assist regulators to 
remove poor providers from our market and to improve consumer 
outcomes. i also do not believe that the product itself is at the heart 
of regulators’ concerns – this is primarily about the mis-selling of the 
product by certain providers, either through unrealistic claims or by 
targeting consumers for whom the product is inappropriate. our uk headquarters in the city of london is supported by two major operational hubs in krakow, poland, and bangalore, india. new office opens
