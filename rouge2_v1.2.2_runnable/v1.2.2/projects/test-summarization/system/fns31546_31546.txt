closely reflects the market rate, we are seeing

operations. trust and respect

. we 
obtain value for shareholders by capitalising on 
our covenant strength, which allows us to enter 
into arrangements for profit sharing and capital 
investments by landlords. the group’s leasehold properties are held on 
institutional lease terms at or below market 
rents. as a result of these 
acquisitions we have also benefitted from a 
number of cross-selling opportunities. adding to these wins, we are delighted to have 
renewed a number of contracts within our 
existing portfolio of blue-chip customers, worth 
an estimated £41 million and secured a further 
£89 million of new volume with new and 
existing customers. iforce has three distribution centres and 
operations at six customer sites. speedy freight has 40 branches. this increase brings logistical challenges 
for our customers. more and more of our customers require an 
end-to-end solution and this is driving the 
need for additional optimally located 
warehousing space, increased use of it 
systems and more complex warehouse 
operations, including returns management, 
product repair and online market place sales. eddie stobart logistics plc annual report and accounts 2017

. in particular, for retailers 
the continuing trend of omni-channel 
retailing requires specialist logistics 
knowledge and skills. eddie stobart remains well positioned for 
growth due to the scale of our network and our 
pay-as-you go model, complemented by our 
sector expertise and consulting-led approach, 
and our extensive warehouse capacity of 
c.6.4m sq.feet (excluding sites we operate for 
customers). as a result of the above, retailers are 
continually reviewing their supply chains to 
identify opportunities to reduce costs, whilst 
maintaining the effectiveness of their in-store 
and online offers. this, we believe, will increasingly lead to the 
outsourcing of logistics operations to scalable 
logistics operators, such as eddie stobart.
