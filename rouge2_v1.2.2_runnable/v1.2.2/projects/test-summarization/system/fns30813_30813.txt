3  underlying performance measures are defined as statutory performance 
measures excluding amounts relating to and discontinued operations 
and non-underlying items. use of non-gaap measures: in addition to performance measures directly 
observable in the group financial statements (ifrs measures), additional 
financial measures (described as non-gaap) are presented that are used 
internally by management as key measures to assess performance. this will 
be a platform for more rapid growth in the 
currently under -developed london market, 
and for the development of innovation in 
technology, pricing and menus. the board has a rigorous approach 
to capital allocation – making sure that existing 
businesses are invested in to maintain and 
grow competitive advantage, appraising new 
growth opportunities, and returning cash 
to shareholders, all within an appropriate 
capital structure. the uk remains one of the leading franchises 
across the domino’s network worldwide, 
and our franchisees are rightly considered 
to be among the very best anywhere in the 
world. we also took the opportunity 
to acquire a majority stake in the largest 
franchisee in the london area. outside our home market, progress has 
been encouraging. in the republic of ireland, 
we opened our first stores for six years 
in response to the strong economic 
recovery in that market. domino’s pizza group plc annual report & accounts 2017

overview
i am pleased to report that domino’s has 
achieved another year of good growth, despite 
a more challenging market environment. corporate governance financial statements strategic report
annual report & accounts 2017 domino’s pizza group plc 03
in our newer markets we took majority 
ownership in iceland, norway and sweden 
during the year, and accelerated our growth 
plans in norway by acquiring dolly dimple’s, 
the number three player. 4  non-underlying items are defined as being items that are material 
in size, unusual or infrequent in nature, and are disclosed separately 
as non-underlying items in the notes to the accounts. i would also like to acknowledge the huge 
support of the global domino’s network, 
and the benefits of knowledge sharing and 
brand visibility it brings; our suppliers, for 
the quality and reliability they bring to our 
partnership; and of course our customers, 
who remain as enthusiastic as ever about 
domino’s pizza despite the increasing 
choices available to them. customers 
love domino’s because it tastes great, and 
is fast and convenient. our franchisees open and run stores, and 
earn a return from the margin they make 
on making and selling pizza. 2  like-for-like sales system sales are defined as system sales from 
stores that were opened before 27 december 2015 and have not 
been impacted by donating territory to a new store (split), compared 
to the corresponding 52-week period in the prior year. 5  2016–2017 from continuing operations (2014–2015 restated; 
2013 not restated). 6  nordics comprises our operations in sweden, norway and iceland. 7  2016–2017 from continuing operations (2013–2015 restated for the 3 for 1 
sub-division of shares effective on 27 june 2016). we maintained our strong 
growth track record for the ordinary dividend, 
raising it by 12.5% to give a total dividend 
for the year of 9.00p. our market share in the uk is 46%. what we do and how we do it

1  stores that have traded for two full 
corporate years or more. 2 sales per week per address in catchment. we operate stores 
almost entirely through franchisee partners. increasingly our stores are 
located in high visibility, easy access locations 
close to other shops and businesses. the rest of the 
market comprises small local chains and 
independent operators. the group and our franchisees are 
well positioned to absorb these rises 
relative to other operators in the market, 
given the very strong economics of 
our stores. we are seeing 
an acceleration in growth in switzerland, 
driven by changes to menu pricing and 
a very strong online performance. we 
are confident of the prospects for all of 
these markets, which offer a further exciting 
stage of growth for domino's shareholders. corporate social responsibility report page 28
conclusion
2017 has been a year of significant evolution 
and progress, despite a weaker consumer 
environment in our core market. where we see opportunities 
to invest for growth, we will continue to 
take them, and i remain optimistic about 
our prospects. we make, sell and deliver pizza and 
a range of other dishes under the domino’s 
brand from 1,192 stores across six european 
markets. we manufacture dough and act as a scale 
and expert wholesaler of other food and 
non-food supplies to our franchisees. pizza delivery
pizza is the single biggest cuisine within 
the delivered food market, accounting 
for £2.1bn of sales (including “pre-order 
carry-out”, or collection sales). the competitive landscape
competition in delivered food splits broadly 
between the more traditional pizza delivery 
businesses, and online aggregators enabling 
newer entrants offering different cuisines 
via a single online or app-based portal. we invest in technology to develop the 
ordering platform, making it easy for 
customers and improving franchisees’ 
operations, and we market the brand and 
plan national promotions. we will look to franchise 
out stores in most markets as we achieve 
greater scale and profitability through 
a larger network. profitability and returns 
can be further enhanced over time through 
investment in dough manufacturing 
capacity and our supply chain. our franchisees also 
differentiate themselves from delivery 
service companies by offering full 
employment terms to drivers rather 
than flexible contracts.
