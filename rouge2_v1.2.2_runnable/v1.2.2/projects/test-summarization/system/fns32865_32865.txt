sanne has delivered a strong set of financial 
results in 2017. total revenues increased by 77% 
overall, with organic revenue growth of 14%. sanne completed the acquisition of the mauritian 
business, international financial services limited 
and ifs trustees (together ifs) on 1 january 2017, 
and increased its luxembourg presence with the 
acquisitions of luxembourg investment solutions 
s.a. (lis) and compliance partners s.a. (cp) on 6 
february 2018.
corporate governance
during the year the board has further developed 
its corporate governance. board membership
spencer daley, chief financial officer (cfo), is to 
take on the role of head of m&a and strategy, 
with responsibility for helping the group explore 
and maximise strategic opportunities, both 
organic and inorganic. spencer will be succeeded 
as cfo by james ireland. i am delighted that james is joining sanne as cfo 
as spencer’s successor. he has worked very closely 
with both dean godwin, sanne’s chief executive 
officer, and spencer for a number of years, and 
engaged well with the broader management team 
and board at sanne. established platform of controls and processes
an emphasis on compliance and risk management is 
fundamental to the success of sanne. increased dividend
the board continues to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy, subject always to maintaining a 
sufficient level of dividend cover. 2017 was a year of group-wide consolidation, 
and significant work has been undertaken to 
strengthen procedures and controls. additional investment has also 
been made in staff training and in standardising 
our processes and procedures. client focused
sanne adopt a tailored approach in tandem with 
clients, enabling the provision of client specific 
solutions. increasing and changing regulations 
are difficult to deal with in-house and outsourcing 
the administration of this to a specialist provider 
with a global footprint such as sanne becomes an 
ever more attractive proposition. more information is provided on our corporate 
governance in the director’s report on pages 
47 to 49. in addition, on pages 42 to 47 there is 
a report on how sanne complies with the uk 
corporate governance code (the code). sanne supports the charitable efforts of
