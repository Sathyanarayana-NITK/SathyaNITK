principal activities, business review and 
future developments
the principal activity of the group is the secure validation and 
redemption of digital promotions in real-time for the grocery, 
retail and hospitality industries. in addition to the strengthened board, 
the executive team has been joined 
by david aylmer as chief operating 
officer to provide particular focus on 
client delivery, security and scalability 
of our operational capabilities. measuring the effect of social media
there is increased pressure for 
businesses to measure marketing return 
on investment (“roi”) across social 
media channels and prove that it’s a 
valuable revenue stream. the redemption outlets benefited 
from the increased footfall and spend 
per head and fraud is reduced as all 
the campaigns have used unique 
chief executive’s review
i was delighted to take 
the opportunity to become 
the company’s ceo in 
september 2016. i had 
already spent a significant 
part of my career looking 
at how data can change 
consumer marketing, and 
immediately recognised the 
great potential for eagle eye 
to revolutionise the way that 
businesses engage with 
consumers. this 
reflects the progress we are making 
in deepening eagle eye’s system 
capability within major accounts, which 
will open up recurring transactional 
revenues in future periods. since signing the 
partnership, we have implemented the 
core foundations for a solid working 
relationship and most importantly 
recruited an international team to work 
solely with tcc. excitingly, we are engaged and 
in discussions with multiple retailers 
through the partnership and expect to 
accelerate win ratios across europe. we expect to see this partnership 
develop throughout 2018 and beyond. we are continuing to explore strategic 
alliances and partnerships that either 
allow us to expedite our win ratio or 
extend our reach in the value chain. security breach and fraud may also 
lead to regulatory investigations, 
sanctions (including fines) and litigation 
with clients and consumers. the group relies primarily 
on enforcement of its pending and 
granted patents under applicable patent 
laws and non-disclosure agreements to 
protect its intellectual property rights. no assurance can be given that the 
group will develop further technologies 
or products which are patentable, that 
patents will be sufficiently broad in 
their scope to provide protection for 
the group’s intellectual property rights 
against third parties, or that patents 
will have been granted in all new 
territories which the group enters. patents pending or future patent 
applications may not be granted and 
the lack of any such patents may 
have a material adverse effect on the 
group’s ability to develop and market 
its proposed products. overview

our work with tcc supports our 
move into the previously unaddressed 
european market, providing even greater 
international reach. the joint proposition is 
now being actively marketed “tcc digital 
connect” and taken into tcc’s european 
clients. since tim’s appointment we have 
reviewed our external messaging 
to put the consumer at the heart of 
what we do. the new office and operational 
team supports the loblaw project and 
will act as a hub to capitalise on the 
significant north american market 
opportunity estimated to be worth over 
$84bn (cadent consulting group 2015 
and raymond james 2016). 2. transact
redemption volumes, which are a 
key measure of usage of the air 
platform and of the success of our 
“transact” strategy, have grown by 
58% year-on-year to 60.4m (2016: 
38.4m). volume growth was primarily 
driven by the full year benefit of asda 
volumes, the first phase roll-out for 
sainsbury’s in the fourth quarter of 
2017 and increased brand activity 
through redemption outlets. using asda as a nationwide redemption 
channel, from july 2016 to october 
2016, coke zero sugar ran a 
promotional campaign across the air 
platform that generated a redemption 
rate of over 10%, compared to the 
typical redemption rate of a traditional 
analogue campaign of 0.5%–2% 
(shopper technology institute/juniper 
research). there has been a significant emphasis 
on people during 2017, ensuring that 
the leadership team is geared for 
scale and the culture resonates with 
both our people and our customers. we have introduced a new 
life skills training workshop based on 
the fundamental philosophy that people 
can benefit from understanding more 
about themselves, how they perform at 
their best and what triggers sub-optimal 
performance. furthermore, our investment 
in people improves the capability and 
competency of the staff in the business. the values that we have in place 
shape our behaviour, reinforce our 
culture and determine our approach 
to recruitment. this is particularly relevant for our 
mid-tier customers who increasingly 
want an end-to-end solution. with the benefit of his 
retail and consumer experience, our 
product marketing has shifted from 
being solely focused on our technology 
to articulating what we do from the 
consumer’s perspective. large retailers can’t shift the dial 
the big retailers have substantial 
analogue schemes which are so 
embedded in the organisation that it is 
a challenge to upgrade and innovate 
their systems. this means they are 
looking for alternative routes to get new 
schemes to market quicker presenting 
a sizeable market opportunity for eagle 
eye’s innovative loyalty offering.
