we are pleased to report continued growth both in 
market share and company scale, driven by strong 
operating and financial performance. the average subscription contract duration, consistent 
with prior-year, is close to 28 months, resulting in the 
majority of the contract value being booked to deferred 
revenue to be recognised over the contract’s lifetime. this adds to the high levels of visibility into future 
revenues and profits. new billings and hardware sales
continued strong growth in new billings, +21 percent in 
fy17 and c.40k customers added. our significant growth in billings and free cash flow 
over the previous financial year was driven by ongoing 
investment in organic and acquired product innovation. 2

threat landscape
the 2016 threat landscape was dominated by two 
themes: state-sponsored hacking and cyberwarfare at 
the global level; and the specific threats of ransomware 
and phishing at the local business level. these themes demonstrated the challenges that face 
all businesses worldwide – attacks can be targeted, 
sustained and highly sophisticated, and they can be 
opportunistic and random. while the headlines were consumed with high profile 
hacking, customers and partners across the world 
highlighted ransomware and phishing threats as the 
biggest challenge to maintaining security. 06 awards
