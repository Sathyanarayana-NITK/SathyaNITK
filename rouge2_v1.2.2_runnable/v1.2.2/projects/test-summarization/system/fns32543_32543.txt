our areas of key focus
our objective at renold is to deliver mid-teens 
operating margins. renold tooth 
chain continues to trade ahead of expectations. the breakeven point at march 2017 reflects the increased fixed cost 
acquired with renold tooth chain, along with increased commercial and marketing 
activities. these factors increase the breakeven point, but are partially offset by 
ongoing operational improvements. our market-leading products can be seen in 
diverse applications from cement making to 
chocolate manufacturing, subway trains to 
power stations, escalators to quarries; in fact, 
anywhere something needs to be lifted,  
moved, rotated or conveyed. the directors’ report 
provides other statutory and regulatory 
information. the financial statements for the group and 
the company can be found at pages 100 to 
155 towards the end of the annual report 
and accounts. we use a number of technical terms 
and abbreviations within this document. all major manufacturing sites certified to
