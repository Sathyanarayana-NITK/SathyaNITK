our finance team are to be congratulated for 
their diligence and integrity in standing up for the 
correct treatment and precise year end cut off. on 
the downside, we have expended considerable 
management time on resolving these issues. andrew remains on 
extended sick leave. i am pleased to report that 
richard has been able to rapidly execute on a 
plan to get the business back on track as soon as 
possible and will help out for as long as necessary. these are internally and externally 
audited annually to ensure compliance. this has led to cost overruns but 
the resultant ground-breaking innovation in these 
solutions has resulted in further international interest 
and the closure of the bristol transport contract in 
q1 2018. 
these solutions offer real time adaptive traffic 
signalling, dynamic timetabling and printing, alters 
and monitoring solutions for multi modal journeys, 
dynamic stand management, performance 
monitoring of journey times, bus lateness and air 
quality, as well as “green wave” solutions to control 
vehicle speed for current and autonomous vehicles. • increased management time and resources to 
achieve the partial integration which detracted 
attention from the core business. a citizen-led approach also ensures 
craven residents can enjoy enhanced engagement with the  
council in a timely, efficient manner. idox plc annual report  
& accounts 2017 idox group is a leading 
supplier of digital 
software and services 
to a diverse customer 
base spanning 
both the uk and 
international markets. – halarose develops, markets, sells and supports 
a range of electoral back office software and 
services to uk local authorities. it enables 
its customers to be more efficient both in the 
production and management of the electoral 
register and in the running of elections and 
referenda. the acquisition is in line with idox’s 
strategic focus. reconciliations between adjusted and 
statutory results are contained within these financial 
statements. i am pleased to report that the year-end audit and 
subsequent review of revenue recognition did not 
show up any additional material problems around 
accounting irregularities, nor did it increase the size 
of the related adjustment materially. as a result, an 
adjustment was made to management figures 
relating to 6pm licence revenue. in practice this was not possible and 6pm licences were recognised over 
time resulting in a £1m difference between expected revenues and actual 
revenues recognised. company information

however, we suffered a setback in the second half 
of the year due to a combination of factors which 
overall impacted our reported profits for the year; 
first, as a result of customer disruption in the wake 
of the june 2017 uk general election, sign-off on 
some contract wins, especially within health and 
transport, was delayed; secondly, following an 
internal review by our finance team in preparation for 
the full year audit, we identified nine contracts where 
we did not consider revenue should be recognised 
in these results. this will be completed 
during h1 2018 with a new streamlined 
organisational structure. halarose acquired in 
august 2017 is part of the pss segment. election revenues accounted for £4.7m (2016: 
£5.6m) of pss revenues with the division delivering 
on the may local elections and the general election.
