chairman’s  
statement
our recruitment division has again seen 
significant organic revenue growth, of 10%, 
and, with two further acquisitions in 2017, 
their total revenue has increased by 14%, 
achieved against the backdrop of 
uncertainty around brexit and the impact 
that it has had on lowering migration. our 
peopleplus division has met the challenge of 
delivering the final years of the existing work 
programme, continuing to be the best 
performing supplier to the dwp and 
positioning itself to become a leading 
supplier of apprenticeship levy training. other opportunities during 2017 included 
winning the fair start programme in 
scotland. 3 overview strategic report corporate governance financial statements

people. the five-year 
underlying operating profit target of 
£30m was comfortably exceeded, being 
achieved two years early, in 2015.
underlying profit before tax* reduced 
by 1% to £36.3m (2016: £36.7m). a change in the sales  
mix between the two divisions, with 
recruitment accounting for 88% of 
the 2017 revenue (2016: 84%), has had 
a comparative impact on the group’s 
gross profit margin, with a reduction 
from 14.2% in 2016 to 11.9% in 2017 . the restructuring of peopleplus has 
positioned the division well to provide a 
strong apprenticeship levy offering, as well 
as being agile enough to take advantage 
of other opportunities in the employability, 
justice and wellbeing sectors. we provide this flexibility and choice
• helping our customers to be more 
efficient by providing flexible 
workforces, when they want and where 
they want. underpinned with strong 
compliance and ethical standards
staffline is a values-based organisation 
which exists to help our customers be more 
successful. these values 
influence the way we act, interact with 
staff, clients and candidates on a daily
through our peopleplus division:
• helping people into sustainable work
• building a skilled workforce for the 
future and developing careers
• rehabilitating offenders into society

basis and can be measured in the strong 
results that we consistently achieve. he is ideally 
positioned to lead the business through 
its next stage of strategic development. the board and i are confident 
that the recruitment division can continue 
to grow its market share through further 
organic growth, as well as suitable 
acquisitions which strengthen our offering. key priorities for the  
two divisions in 2018 are: 
recruitment:
• continued organic growth – focus on 
our core business
• continued strong cash conversion – 
focus on margin and payment terms
• bolt on acquisitions – enhancing 
continued organic growth
• new digital platform – differentiation  
in a tight labour market
peopleplus: 
• optimisation of work programme 
business 
• deliver growth in our prisons’ offender 
learning and skills services contracts
• develop and grow private skills market 
business through the apprenticeship 
levy
• develop and grow our presence in 
wales, scotland and local government
• develop new market propositions in 
health and wellbeing and corporate 
learning and development
despite the change in sales mix within 
peopleplus, we expect the group’s 2018 
profit to be slightly higher than in 2017. 
continued strong cash generation should 
either result in net debt being eliminated in 
2018 or provide the resources to acquire 
additional businesses. the group is in an 
excellent position to continue to generate 
shareholder value through growing 
cashflows in future years. the recruitment services include:
• staffline onsite, based on clients’ 
premises and providing both blue and 
white collar, managed, temporary 
workforces
• driving plus, providing hgv drivers  
to the driving industry
• staffline agriculture, providing workers 
to the uk farming and horticulture

branch based operation 
• brightwork, a recruitment business 
based in scotland specialising in 
temporary and permanent jobs to  
the drinks industry
• diamond recruitment, one of the

services in northern ireland
priorities for next five years:
• continue run rate double-digit growth 
and increase market share from 9%  
to 15%
• maintain focus on core blue collar

• use technology to enhance competitive

board changes and  
senior management overview
i am pleased to announce that, with 
effect from 24 january 2018, chris 
pullen is appointed as chief executive 
of staffline group plc. chris succeeds 
andy hogarth who will step down from 
his current role while remaining on the 
board as a non-executive director. andy hogarth has been chief executive of 
staffline group plc since 2003, during which 
time the group has grown to almost £1bn in 
revenue. ** net debt including unamortised transaction costs
the below charts show the split of 
underlying operating profit between  
the two divisions for the last three years. however, the exiting run 
rate of 2017 exceeds this target and 
remains a significant achievement 
compared to the starting point of 
revenues of £367m in 2012, when the 
five-year plan began. whilst 
a reduction, this is a good achievement 
given the work programme run-off 
in peopleplus that began in march 
2017. reported profit before tax 
increased by 28% to £24.1m (2016: 
£18.9m), primarily due to exceptional 
reorganisation costs incurred in 
2016 not being repeated in 2017.
cash generation was again strong, 
with free cash flows (being ebitda plus 
working capital movement, less tax paid 
and capex) amounting to £37.9m. net 
debt** fell by £20.2m, from £36.7m at 
the end of december 2016 to £16.5m 
at the end of december 2017. this 
provides the group with a solid base 
from which to continue to generate 
shareholder value into the future. skills. this project will further 
develop our skills and employability offering
