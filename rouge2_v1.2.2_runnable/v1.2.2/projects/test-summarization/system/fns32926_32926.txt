proactive, accessible and bold. in particular, gdpr was approved 
by the european union (eu) and takes effect 
from may 2018. it intends to strengthen and 
unify data protection for all individuals within

profiling is information that may

whom such information pertains. the acquisition was 
successfully integrated into kape by 
june 2017 and i am delighted to 
report, made a positive net profit 
contribution in the year of $1.5 million. this 
resulted in an increase in cyberghost’s 
user base by over 30% compared to 
december 2016 and the last quarter of 
2017 saw record sales for the business 
in terms of volume and ebitda. special dividend

cash flow from operations of $7.6 
million, the board has declared a 
special dividend of 4.93 us$ cents 
per share, amounting to a total of 
$7.0 million. the dividend shall be paid 
in sterling and therefore it will be 
subject to a conversion exchange 
rate from us dollars based on a 
gbp/usd rate of 1.3887, being the 
rate at 4.30 pm on 12 march 2018; 
as a result shareholders will receive 
3.55 pence per share. our management team has worked 
tirelessly to deliver on our stated

charge derives mainly from group subsidiaries’ residual 
profits. moran laufer
