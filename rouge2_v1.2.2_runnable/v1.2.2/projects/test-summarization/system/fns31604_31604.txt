slot-constrained primary airports that deliver choice and flexibility to our customers. we have achieved a headline return on capital employed  
of 11.9% as we start to take deliveries of our new fleet order, 
including our first a320neo aircraft. moya brings significant transport and 
logistics expertise as well as her experience as a ftse 100

the fleet plan delivers a significant cost per seat 
benefit, as well as supporting an increase in 
market share in slot-constrained airports. aircraft numbers represent based aircraft. aircraft

developing our fleet
our new a320 and a321neo 
planes will allow us to fly more 
passengers than ever to their 
destinations, increasing 
profitability and taking an 
important step in reducing 
our environmental footprint. • up-gauging of fleet with the delivery of an additional 21 
186-seat a320 and two a320neo aircraft and retrofitting of 
49 existing 180-seat a320s to 186-seats. up-gauging and efficient fleet management 
• moving from 156 seats on an a319 to 186 seats on an 
a320neo aircraft is expected to deliver a cost per seat 
saving of around 11% to 13%. this is being achieved by 
increasing the proportion of higher gauge a320 aircraft in 
the fleet:
 – all new a320 deliveries will be fitted with 186 seats;
 – retrofitting the existing fleet of 180-seat a320s; and
 – introduction of the 186-seat a320neo from june 2017. 50

driving revenue growth
we have a clear focus on building strong relationships  
with customers to create more sustainable, long-term  
revenues leveraging quality, innovation and digital. our passenger growth was 
healthy, increasing by 9.7% to 80.2 million, and revenue 
increased to £5,047 million, an increase of 8.1%. reported profit after  
tax was £305 million. as a result we are 
recommending a dividend of 40.9 pence per share based on 
our payout policy of 50% of headline profit after tax.
