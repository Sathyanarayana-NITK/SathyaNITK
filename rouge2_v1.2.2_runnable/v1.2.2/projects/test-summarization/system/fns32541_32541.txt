in the uk. by getting that right 
we’re able to create long-term 
value for our shareholders. which is why 
a compelling employer brand is an

we now measure customer 
satisfaction across every one  
of our retail destinations,  
using online surveys to track  
feedback on events and the  
overall customer experience. we have a 
portfolio of first-class assets combined with 
historically low levels of operational and  
financial gearing at a time of geopolitical

evolving market conditions require role changes 
in our teams as our emphasis shifts from selling 
and development to management and buying. outlook
we’ve achieved our plan to have minimal 
development exposure and longer lease terms 
in london offices, a transformed retail portfolio 
and low gearing at this point. our aim is to create a great experience 
for everyone we rely on, from our 
customers to our communities, 
partners and employees. we believe 
that’s the best way to create long-term 
sustainable value for our shareholders 
and everyone else we affect. however, 
by having a clear strategy and acting 
early, we’ve been able to achieve a 
good relative performance this year. we then draw on our experience  
to create the very best experiences 
for them. which is why our 
ventilation system at the zig zag building 
supplies air as fresh as you’d find at the coast. at bluewater, our upgraded system is so 
effective we’ve turned off the air conditioning. and in retail, there remained 
continued demand from dynamic brands 
for new and repurposed space in the  
best locations. for 
example, at 1 new street square 
smart design choices saved 200 
tonnes of carbon and reduced 
material costs by more than 
£600,000. successful businesses continued to look 
for innovative, technically resilient space 
in london. that includes 
operational efficiency, but it’s also 
about attracting, inspiring and 
enabling talent. designed with care
we work to create memorable 
customer experiences while 
minimising our impact. community impact
we’ve launched the uk’s first 
scaffolding academy inside a 
prison, helping offenders at  
hmp brixton get the skills and 
experience they need to find 
employment outside – reducing  
the risk of re-offending. we consider both the short and  
long-term effects of our actions. and in this annual report, we’ve 
further integrated important  
content about our broader social  
and environmental impacts. that means recognising the deeper, 
long-term effects of decisions 
and actions. market environment

employer brand
we aim to provide employees with 
a great career experience, so we’re 
delighted to be one of property 
week’s ‘best places to work in 
property’ list – the only listed reit 
included in their list. with the background of 
geopolitical and economic uncertainty 
affecting the uk, our markets lost 
momentum during the year. that affected our 
markets, weakening demand for space. supply-constrained 
conditions eased and the vacancy rate 
rose, with the brexit vote a catalyst  
for change. in the retail sector, a range of factors 
impacted retailers’ confidence, from  
the threat of cost inflation to online
