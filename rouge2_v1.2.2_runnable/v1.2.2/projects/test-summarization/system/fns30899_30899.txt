0. during the year we had average net cash 
of £42 million – compared to £46 million 
average net debt in the previous year and 
reported year end net cash excluding 
non-recourse borrowings of £335 million. during the year, the 
group had average net cash of £42 million 
(2016: £46 million net debt); at year end, 
the group had net cash of £335 million 
(2016: £173 million). * a reconciliation of the group’s net cash measure to the statutory measure is provided on page 41. non-recourse net borrowings 
are cash and debt that are ringfenced within certain infrastructure concession project companies. this transformation has been 
achieved whilst maintaining one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the sector, 
maximising value in our investments 
portfolio and paying a sustainable and 
progressive dividend. the partial sale of our holding 
in the m25, london’s orbital motorway, 
demonstrates our commitment to 
maximise shareholder value, with the 
sale price considerably higher than a 
comparable market transaction from 2016.
we have continued our practice of only 
bidding for work on appropriate terms 
and for those projects best aligned to 
our capabilities. whilst we have 
not seen an impact on our markets, any 
restrictions on the movement of workers 
would be likely to exacerbate the current 
shortages of skilled labour in our sector. the dallas horseshoe: following a distinctive 
u-shaped path, this design-build project upgraded 
73 miles of road and 37 bridges to reduce congestion 
in dallas, texas. notably, in the uk we were selected to 
deliver two lots of the new high speed 
railway (hs2) and won orders to construct 
the marine tunnels at the hinkley point c 
nuclear power plant. in the us, we secured 
work to reconstruct and improve the 
southern gateway – an 11-mile stretch 
of road in dallas, texas – and the 4.7-mile 
green line rail extension in boston, 
massachusetts. in early 2018 we entered 
our ﬁrst major public-private partnership 
(p3) in the us civil infrastructure market 
for the los angeles world airports 
automated people mover. 4 re-presented to classify the group’s 49% interests in dutco balfour beatty llc and bk gulf llc as discontinued operations. the group reported an underlying proﬁt 
from operations (pfo) of £196 million 
(2016: £69 million) driven by material year-
on-year improvements in all earnings-based 
businesses. the year end ﬁgure

these measures and appropriate reconciliations to statutory measures are provided on 
pages 38 to 43. projects are 
monitored rigorously and 
regularly, with consistent 
processes and systems. when we embarked on the build to 
last transformation programme our 
commitment was to make balfour beatty 
a strong and sustainable company and 
the sector’s leading performer. projects are monitored 
rigorously and regularly, with consistent 
processes and systems. i am proud of the progress we have 
made so far. on behalf of the board 
i would like to thank all of our employees 
for their commitment once again this year. as a board, we 
review each serious accident in detail and 
seek actions to prevent a reoccurrence; 
however i realise that this is of little comfort 
to the families of those who lost their 
lives and i use this letter to send formal 
condolences to the bereaved on behalf of 
the board and everyone in our business. every time someone is injured, it reinforces 
why we must always strive to do more to 
make our industry safer. build to last
