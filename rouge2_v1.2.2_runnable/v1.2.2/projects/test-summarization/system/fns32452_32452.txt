strategy
earlier in the year we committed to a strategic plan to accelerate 
our business growth and enhance shareholder value by both 
developing our core business and commercialising the investment 
in our proprietary device programmes. more likely is a partnering 
arrangement that will be for europe and the rest of the world, 
excluding the us, but with an option to commercialise the 
product in the us where the regulatory authorities will demand 
that the product goes down the pre-market approval route. •

and to seek to address a specific risk with a korean customer

possibly impact 18/19 revenues if not addressed this year. brad selman, vp global sales
