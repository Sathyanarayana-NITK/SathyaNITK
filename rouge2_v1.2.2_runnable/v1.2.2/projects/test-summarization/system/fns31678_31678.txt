finally, a lot of university-owned pbsa 
was built pre-1999 and will continue to 
deteriorate. we give them 
visibility of our pipeline, so they can 
build their businesses around ours and 
we can balance their workload by 
scheduling build to rent schemes 
around the student accommodation 
programme. that 
also applies to accommodation 
management, where we can replicate 
in build to rent what we have achieved 
with fresh student living. the visibility provided by developing 
student accommodation is central to this 
strategy. ebitda comprises 
operating profit from continuing operations plus 
the group’s profit from joint ventures, adding 
back charges for depreciation and amortisation. for fy16, adjusted ebitda is stated before 
exceptional ipo costs. 2. for fy17, there is no difference between 
operating profit and adjusted operating profit. for fy16, adjusted operating profit is stated 
before exceptional ipo costs. annual report and financial statements 2017

watkin jones plc  //  annual report and financial statements 2017 03 we continued to successfully implement our strategy during  
the year and were recognised for the quality of our business  
and leadership through a number of awards. significant funds are available for 
investment in build to rent, with the market expected to grow by £45 billion 
over the next five years. significant growth prospects 
we see the potential to deliver significant growth in the coming years. the development pipeline 
gives us excellent visibility of our revenues 
and earnings, protecting our performance 
and giving us the time to adjust our plans 
if necessary. is this a trend in the market? we have strong relationships with institutional 
investors and a reputation for successful, 
on-time delivery of high-quality developments. this enables us 
to offer an end-to-end solution for 
investors, delivered in-house and with 
minimal reliance on third parties, across 
an asset’s entire life cycle. business model reduces risk 
watkin jones plc is one of the few companies in pbsa and build to rent offering 
a complete solution to investors, from identifying the site through to managing 
the finished building. we believe that we are the only full-service provider to sell 
all our developments, meaning we do not compete with our own investment 
clients. our competitive advantage lies in our 
business model and our experienced 
management team. having spent much of the previous year 
organising as a public company, fy17 was a year 
of confident delivery. chairman’s statement
