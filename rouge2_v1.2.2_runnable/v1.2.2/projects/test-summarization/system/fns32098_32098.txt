on 7 september 2016 the company and hewlett 
packard enterprise (“hpe”), announced that they had agreed 
that micro focus would acquire hpe’s software business 
segment (“hpe software”) by way of merger (“merger”) with 
a wholly owned subsidiary of hpe incorporated to hold the 
business of hpe software. this was 
achieved during a year of signiﬁcant change and distraction as we;
 – completed the acquisition of serena software inc. (“serena”) together 
with three other smaller acquisitions; 
 – integrated serena into the micro focus product portfolio; 
 – entered the ftse 100 on 6 september 2016;
 – became the spin/merge partner for hpe software;
 – began to work on the plan for integrating hpe software;
 – completed required regulatory ﬁlings in the uk, usa and elsewhere; 
 – reﬁnanced the company’s existing debt; and
 – raised new banking facilities to enable the completion of the hpe 
software transaction and the return of value. like the attachmate group (“tag”) and serena acquisitions, the combination 
with hpe software has clear business logic to extend micro focus’ market 
presence in mature infrastructure software segments; to increase the 
operational efﬁciency of the combined group; to deliver effective product 
management focused on customer centred innovation and improve sales 
productivity. this has now been superseded by the plan to adopt new systems being 
implemented in hpe software. a global infrastructure software business focused on 
operational effectiveness and scale, with revenues of 
$1,380.7m and underlying adjusted ebitda of $640.9m. this will create a global infrastructure software business with pro-forma 
revenues in the 12 months to 30 april 2017 of approximately $4.4 billion and 
underlying adjusted ebitda of approximately $1.4 billion making it one of the 
largest dedicated software companies in the world and a leading technology 
stock on the lse. once we achieve our target cash conversion ratio for the enlarged group of 
90% to 95% we will generate signiﬁcant free cash ﬂows from which we can 
deliver signiﬁcant returns of value to our shareholders and/or further highly 
accretive acquisitions. overview strategic report corporate governance

shares (“ads”) on the new york stock exchange (“nyse”) 
(“completion”). following completion we will align our ﬁnancial year end 
to 31 october and will initially report an 18 month ﬁnancial period ending 
31 october 2018. this will enable us to launch the new company’s ﬁnancial 
year with effect from 1 november 2017. 
during the year ended 30 april 2017 the micro focus business traded in line 
with the expectations we had set at the beginning of the year. micro focus sets out to deliver 
consistent long-term shareholder returns of between 15% and 20% per 
annum. the response to this is 
consolidation. to be successful in this stage of a market both operational 
effectiveness and scale are critical. we believe that micro focus is now 
well positioned to lead in this space. it is 100% consistent with the company’s strategy which, as you 
will see in the following pages, has not had any signiﬁcant changes from the 
plan laid out ﬁve and a half years ago. customer

—— the year ended 30 april 2017 was a signiﬁcant year for the 
group. following our integration review in 2015 we decided that the group should 
operate two product portfolios, micro focus and suse, and have reported the 
business this way since 1 may 2015. 
since april 201 1, i have held the roles of both chairman and chief executive 
ofﬁcer (“ceo”). in december 2015 we announced that effective from 
1 february 2016, i would be executive chairman and that stephen murdoch 
and nils brauckmann would become ceo of micro focus and ceo of suse 
respectively. stephen and nils discuss the operating performance of their 
respective portfolios for the year completed in the ceo reports. micro focus existing shareholders will also 
be entitled to receive a return of value which in total will be 
$500m that will be declared immediately prior to completion. the board is conﬁdent that medium-term low single digit revenue 
growth, industry leading margins and strong cash conversion will ensure that 
micro focus can deliver on that strategy. the company has a business strategy, a ﬁnancial strategy, an operating plan 
and an incentive strategy that all support our objective to achieve 15% to 20% 
compound annual return for shareholders. we have set out a new four phase plan on page 4 for the combination of 
the micro focus and hpe software businesses whilst continuing to deliver 
sustainable shareholder returns. key highlights who we are
micro focus specializes in managing predominantly mature 
infrastructure software assets which have been delivering value 
to signiﬁcant numbers of customers over long periods of time. what we do
our customer centred innovation helps organizations bridge 
the old and the new, enabling them to leverage additional 
value from their investments in critical it infrastructure and 
business applications. by enabling our customers to link their investments in 
established technology with the latest innovation, micro focus 
helps organizations gain incremental and sustainable returns 
on investments they have already made and to preserve and 
protect their data and business logic. we have believed for some time that there are signiﬁcant segments of the 
infrastructure software market that have matured. the acquisition of hpe software may delay the return to revenue growth as we 
consolidate the hpe software products. as with prior transactions we expect 
hpe software’s revenue trend to continue its historical decline until signiﬁcant 
change has been implemented. in 2017 we continued to increase the headcount dedicated to development, 
customer care and sales and marketing of the suse portfolio and made the 
ﬁrst acquisitions in this product portfolio. our product portfolios have some or all of the 
following attributes:
1. broad based – covering all industrial sectors
2. signiﬁcant numbers of customers
3. signiﬁcant maintenance streams
4. relatively high switching costs
5. signiﬁcant market positions
in any it system the customers’ business logic and data remain critical to their 
competitive advantage.
