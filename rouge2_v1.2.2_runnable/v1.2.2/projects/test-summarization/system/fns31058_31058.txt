where we operate 
hurricane has a portfolio of contiguous 
offshore licences on the uk continental 
shelf, to the west of shetland. hurricane’s licences are focussed on the 
rona ridge, a major ne-sw trending 
basement feature. this 
involves tying two existing wells back to the 
aoka mizu floating production storage and 
offloading (fpso) vessel. the bluewater-
owned aoka mizu previously operated on 
the blackbird and ettrick fields in the north 
sea and requires only limited upgrades and 
life extension to be used on lancaster. hurricane is a new 
generation of oil company 
that exists to discover, 
appraise and develop  
oil from fractured  
basement reservoirs. fractured basements are a global 
phenomenon which have been produced 
successfully for extended periods in multiple 
locations around the world. however, in 
the uk they represent a new play type 
for a sector of the oil industry which has 
historically focused on sandstone reservoirs. hurricane is the first oil company to target 
fractured basements in the region. the company believes that it will achieve the best value for its asset 
base by progressing the portfolio as a whole. following first oil, with data from the eps 
being generated and no imminent funding 
hurdles, we will be in a strong position to 
move towards establishing the value that can 
be ascribed to our overall acreage holdings. given the challenging oil 
price environment in mid-2017, this was a 
great achievement by management. the 
data generated by the eps will allow us to 
progressively evaluate the performance of 
the lancaster reservoir system and gain 
increasing confidence in the volume of oil 
that we can expect to recover from our 
rona ridge assets. extended 
production will provide data to improve 
understanding of the reservoir to be applied 
across the company’s portfolio in further 
appraisal activity. it’s objectives are to:
•  provide long-term production data to 
enhance understanding of reservoir 
characteristics and associated full field 
development scenarios
•  commence development of resources in 
phased manner with regard to managing 
uncertainties over reservoir characteristics 
and associated development risks
• deliver an acceptable return on investment

our west of shetland portfolio of discoveries  
is now moving towards development with the  
lancaster early production system as the first phase. the company believes that this approach will allow it to 
optimise the value it obtains for its discovered resources. this allows uncertainties 
associated with the reservoir to be removed whilst commencing a 
phased development and generating cash flow. hurricane has drilled eight wells on its 
acreage since 2009 including five on the 
lancaster field. hurricane is now working towards the 
first phase of development of its rona 
ridge assets, the lancaster eps. extension  
to 10 years would increase 
reserves by 25 million barrels

hurricane has focussed on implementing its strategy in the west of 
shetland region of the ukcs. the progress on the upgrade to the aoka 
mizu in dubai and the excellent working 
relationship with the bluewater energy 
services (bluewater) team, is the most 
visible reflection of that strategy. annual report and group financial statements 2017 overview

introduction
2017 was marked 
by the significant 
progress made on  
the lancaster eps. 1  $201.9 million of liquid investments is held in term deposits which mature within 12 months. all licences are 
owned 100%. the group’s loss after tax for the year was 
$7.0 million (2016: profit after tax $0.9 
million). the water depth in the 
area is around 150 metres. in aggregate, 2c contingent resources 
across lancaster and halifax are in excess of 
1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent; a world-class 
prize. 62.1 million stock tank barrels of oil in the 
event hurricane extended the eps duration 
to 10 years, the maximum duration of the 
aoka mizu contract). in addition, a further 
486.1 million stock tank barrels of oil were 
assigned as 2c contingent resources. we completed  
the required 
financing, took  
fid, and received  
fdp approval. the first phase of development of lancaster 
is an early production system (eps). group reserves and resources

year for the company. extensive exploration and appraisal work 
programmes have led to a number of 
significant discoveries in the company’s 
acreage, including lancaster, whirlwind, 
lincoln, and halifax. the eps is key to delivering the reservoir 
information required to move to full field 
development. implementation of hurricane’s strategy has led to a focus on the 
company’s lancaster field, which is now the best understood asset in 
its portfolio, following five wells drilled by hurricane. the company 
plans to bring the lancaster field to commercial production, in 
an initial development phase, the eps. $33.4 million is
