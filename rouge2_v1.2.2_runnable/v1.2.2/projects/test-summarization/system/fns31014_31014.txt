how a re our assets perfor ming? how a re our assets per for ming? the higher commodity prices and revenues during 2017 
translated directly into higher profits and cash generation. operating profit increased to £28.4m from £12.7m in 2016. 
operating costs also increased in the period due to a 
combination of higher staff costs and a greater level of 
investment in business development as we target a higher 
rate of growth in the coming year. our results were, as usual, impacted by a number of 
revaluation adjustments which led to overall profit before tax 
being £11.8m compared to £28.3m in 2016, the decline being 
driven in the main by the valuation of the kestrel royalty. we believe that these levels strike the right balance between 
offering shareholders an attractive dividend yield and 
retaining sufficient resources to drive the growth strategy. perf ormance me asures

09 anglo pacific group plc      annual report & accounts 2017 2017 was a year of continued improvement of performance and 
sentiment in the mining sector. our strategy is to build a diversified portfolio of royalties and metal 
streams, focusing on accelerating income growth through acquiring 
royalties in cash or near-term cash producing assets. it is an objective of the company to pay a substantial portion of these 
royalties and metal streams to shareholders as dividends. historically, royalties originated as a 
result of the sale of a mineral property, 
allowing the seller to retain some 
ongoing economic participation in the 
property. however, an increasing 
number of royalties are now created 
directly by operators and developers 
as a source of finance. i believe this starts at the top. board
we were disappointed to announce in february 2018 that 
rachel rhodes had decided not to put herself forward for 
re-election at the forthcoming agm due to the ever-increasing 
time commitments of her other roles. mike blyth has assumed the role of chair of  
the audit committee. since taking over from mike blyth as chairman at the 2017 
agm, i have been actively seeking to help drive the growth of 
the business on which the whole team is focused. gr o u p o v e rv i e w
our aim is to develop as the leading 
international diversified royalty company 
with a portfolio centred on base metals 
and bulk materials

position and with an exciting pipeline for growth, which is the clear 
focus for the year ahead. we have also enjoyed income from the denison 
investment for the first time. focus for 2018
given the strong financial position that we now enjoy, and  
the positive outlook for the sector, we are focused on 
accelerating the growth of our asset base in the coming years. we have also announced a desire to build  
a meaningful presence in commodities which are focused on  
the growing electric vehicle market, where we see great 
potential. opportunistically, we will look at bulks where we believe the 
price and risk equation is attractive. str ategy
consistent with the above market view and our enhanced 
balance sheet, we intend to accelerate our rate of growth in 
transforming anglo pacific into the preferred royalty vehicle 
for twenty first century commodities. we have an undrawn revolving credit facility and believe this 
can be comfortably expanded whilst retaining low borrowing 
metrics. a major driver for 2018 will be continued supply-side 
constraints driven in part by chinese environmental reform 
initiatives which should continue to negatively impact supply. the team continues to be very disciplined in ensuring that 
acquisitions are of the highest quality in terms of project 
characteristics both technically and commercially and that we 
design transaction structures to optimise risk management. corporate culture and governance
anglo pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in  
all areas of its business. we broadened the agenda at our annual strategy day in 2017  
to include sessions on strategy, including corporate social 
responsibility, risk and board effectiveness. these sessions 
were primarily facilitated by industry experts who brought  
an objective and impartial insight as to how the board 
approaches these areas in executing its strategy.
