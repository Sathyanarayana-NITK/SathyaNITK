chairman’s statement
a year of 
strong growth
“we are pleased with the portfolio’s 
overall performance, especially given the 
current uncertainties in the market, and 
will be concentrating on further lettings 
and active management initiatives 
to continue driving growth forward”
whilst the political and economic uncertainty 
of 2016 continues to play out, the 
underlying quality of circle property plc’s 
portfolio of regional offices and the wealth 
of experience and expertise inherent 
within its management team has driven 
a period of growth for the company. circle’s high level of tenant retention is largely 
attributable to both the high standards of 
management that we demand within our 
multi-let properties and our flexible approach 
to tenant renewal negotiations. the portfolio comprises 
approximately 634,801 sq ft of primarily office accommodation. one castlepark
