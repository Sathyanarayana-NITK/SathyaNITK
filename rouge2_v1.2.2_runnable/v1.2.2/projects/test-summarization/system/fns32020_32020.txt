• further improvements in % contribution  
margin achieved by growth of owned  
brands, drive category focus and cost  
base optimisation, despite material and  
components price increases. • strong financial performance allowing 
investment in brand support and organisational 
capability whilst still delivering significantly 
improved profitability. through continued investment and 
execution of our drive category focus, our offering to those 
customers has become increasingly differentiated, which has 
the dual benefit of a positive impact on margin contribution 
and also improving our competitive advantage, thereby 
making the group more resilient. in line with the industry, both business segments have been 
challenged by increasing material and packaging costs 
resulting from the fall in sterling and global inflationary 
pressures. annual report & accounts 2017 – 8 –

i am delighted to be able to report another year of 
considerable progress for swallowfield and one in which we 
have seen real benefits from consistent focus on the elements 
of our ‘building a better swallowfield’ strategy which we first 
put in place in 2014. sales, profitability, earnings per share  
and shareholder value have again increased significantly, 
through a combination of both organic growth and successful 
acquisition activity. results

and then develop strategies for dealing with these risks on  
an ongoing basis. the review process involves  
the classification of risks, assessment to determine the  
relative likelihood of them impacting the business and the 
potential severity of the impact, and determination of whether 
changes to management processes are needed to manage 
them effectively. the focus on the six strategic pillars of ‘creating for tomorrow’ 
outlined earlier in this report are a key part of the risk
