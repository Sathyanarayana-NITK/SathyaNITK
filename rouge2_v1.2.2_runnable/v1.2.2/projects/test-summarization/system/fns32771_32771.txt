principal risks 
and uncertainties
a detailed summary of the 
group’s identification and 
assessment of material risks 
and uncertainties. additionally to 
be able to do this at significantly higher than book value on two mature sites also proves that the 
value-add model that sirius has created works well. this continued growth is reflected in all of the 
key metrics upon which the company is measured. the move does also reflect an ambition to continue on 
the same upward trajectory and the sirius board believes 
that the benefits that will come from the step up will 
help in achieving this ambition. main market move
in march 2017 the company completed the successful 
move of its shares from aim to being admitted for 
trading on the main markets of both the london 
and johannesburg stock exchanges. this has significantly increased the profitability 
and value of the company and culminated with the move 
of its shares to the main markets of both the london 
and johannesburg stock exchanges on 6 march 2017. 
we indicated last year that asset recycling was going 
to be a major element of our continued growth going 
forward and i am pleased to say that we successfully 
agreed the sale of two major core assets at well above 
book value and completed the disposal of a non-core 
asset in the period. this substantial growth was one of the main driving 
forces behind the move up to the main market of the 
london stock exchange and to the main board of the 
johannesburg stock exchange and is indicative of just 
how far the company has progressed over recent years. 9

the move up to the main market of 
the london stock exchange and to 
the main board of the johannesburg 
stock exchange is indicative of 
just how far the company has 
progressed over recent years.”
one of the most pleasing achievements of the year 
under review was being able to demonstrate the full 
cycle of the sirius strategy with €101.9 million of disposals 
either completing or being agreed in addition to the sale 
of a land parcel for €1.5 million. we have created a range of innovative and flexible products by investing into sub-optimal space. the disposal activity was very pleasing in that it provides evidence of our strategy to be able to recycle 
capital from non-core and mature sites into assets with higher value-add potential. 8

of office, storage and production space. whilst retaining 
the major core anchor industrial tenants, many of the

our business model
enhancing rental and 
capital value through active 
portfolio management. 13
our strategy
five value drivers and active 
portfolio management to 
maximise income and value. the stable long-term income from anchor tenants underpins the ability to generate higher revenues from the more flexible 
leasing options. this attracts a large number 
of tenants to our sites whilst generating higher income and asset value growth from space that would often be left vacant or 
rented at low prices. as at 31 march 2017 
approximately 159,000sqm of this space had been 
completely refurbished and was either let or being 
marketed for let. diversified tenant structure

rupert mayer strasse asset 
for €85.0 million was notarised

tenant with multiple tenants on 
higher rents, investing in the 
transformation of sub-optimal 
space and significantly increasing 
net operating income. a loss of €572,000 was recognised 
in the year to 31 march 2017.
the sale of the düsseldorf

for €11.0 million was notarised

chairman of the company; 
presenting another strong 
year of trading results. i am pleased to report another strong year of trading

of keller group plc, as an independent non-executive 
director.
