world of education
tribal is a world-class, education 
focused company, providing the 
expertise, software and services 
needed by education and business 
organisations worldwide, to 
underpin student success. we operate internationally 
and serve hundreds of higher 
education, further education and 
vocational institutions; thousands 
of schools; and many government 
and state bodies, training 
providers and employers; in over 
55 countries. our vision is simply:
to empower the 
world of education. we strive to research, develop and deliver the 
products, services and solutions needed by 
education institutes across the world to support  
their primary goals of educating their students, 
providing optimum learning experiences and 
ultimately delivering successful outcomes. 2

adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share is in respect  
of continuing operations which excludes "other items" charges of £4.8m (2016: charge of £4.6m). 2  
cash conversion is calculated as net cash from operating activities before tax from continuing 
operations, less expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, as a proportion 
of adjusted operating profit. from 2016, share-based payments charges/(credits) are shown in "other items" and no longer part of 
the adjusted operating results. specialist provision comes with unique challenges 
and derwen college needed a flexible student 
information system that could easily meet their 
exacting requirements. tribal developed a staff portal specifically for 
derwen college that allows all members of staff 
to report on all aspects of student behaviour, be it 
praise or concern for a student, instantly through any 
device. ebs collates this information to give a single 
overview of students’ progress. "we selected ebs because the system could easily 
be tailored to our needs, allowing our staff to easily 
monitor our students’ progress, and ultimately focus 
their valuable time on our learners’ success” said 
maggie furmanek, director finance & resources, 
derwen college. we also finalised a 
aud$27 .5m (approx. revenues fell in 2017 to £84.9m (2016: £90.3m); however, 
2016 revenue included £11.6m relating to the ofsted contract 
which successfully concluded in march 2017 (2017 ofsted 
revenue: £3.0m), and £1.7m from synergy (disposed of in march 
2016) and sls (closed 2015). cumulative annualised 
cost savings achieved since the start of the cost efficiencies 
programme total £12.0m, of which £3.0 annualised savings were 
realised in 2017 (2016: £9.0m annualised, of which £5.8m in year). our callista business, which provides student information 
systems to 25% of australian universities, performed well, and 
we finalised a aud$27.5m (approx. £16.8m), four-year extension to the callista 
contract, which provides student information systems to  
11 australian universities for the on-going development of the 
callista product and seamless migration into the cloud ready  
tribal edge platform. the initial modules were launched 
in the summer of 2017 and have sinced been in beta testing. the first four 
modules are expected to be generally available later in 2018.

to skip a year. we look forward to welcoming them back into the 
survey in 2018.
the quality assurance solutions business also performed 
well in 2017 and secured significant contract wins at the abu 
dhabi education council, the ministry of education of dubai & 
northern emirates. additionally, with a further 
contract already secured in dubai and a strong pipeline of new 
work, qas enters 2018 with confidence and optimism. approved by the board of directors on 22 march 2018
