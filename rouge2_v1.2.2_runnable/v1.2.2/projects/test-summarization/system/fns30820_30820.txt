health and safety
health and safety will always be our non-negotiable top priority and continues 
to be the first item discussed at every plc board and regional board meeting 
throughout the business. more information about each director 
can be found within the biographies on pages 46 and 47. i was delighted to 
announce in january that after a rigorous process, we appointed gwyn burr 
to the board as an independent non-executive director, with effect from  
1 february 2018. gwyn has excellent and relevant experience gained from 
both her previous executive experience, primarily focused on customer 
service, and also from her more recent non-executive roles and we very much 
look forward to working with her. we also announced that rob rowley will 
stand down from the board following the agm on 26 april 2018. i would like 
to again express both my and the board’s gratitude for rob’s long and valued 
contribution to the board over the past eight years, including both as the 
company’s senior independent director and as chair of the audit committee. dame kate barker will succeed rob as the board’s senior independent 
director, following the agm, and as planned, humphrey singer succeeded 
rob as the chairman of the audit committee in january 2018. 
the annual board evaluation is an important exercise and one that your  
board as a whole and individually takes very seriously. you can find more perspective on 
market conditions on pages 10 and 11. we recognise that the outcome of  
the general election, combined with the on-going brexit negotiations, has 
resulted in greater political uncertainty. following concern 
expressed by some customers, during 2017 we carried out a review of 
historic lease structures and, in particular, ten-year doubling ground rent 
clauses, which we had stopped using on new developments from late 2011. 
whilst taylor wimpey implemented these leases in good faith and the terms 
were clearly set out in the relevant leases, it was clear from our review that  
the impact of these doubling rent review clauses was causing some of  
our customers understandable concern, particularly from a mortgageability 
and saleability perspective. we acknowledge that the introduction of these 
doubling clauses in 2007 was not consistent with our high standards of 
customer service and we have quite rightly apologised to customers for  
the unintended consequences and concern that we caused. as part of our review, we also stopped selling houses on a leasehold basis  
on our new developments with effect from the start of 2017, other than in 
exceptional circumstances such as where taylor wimpey does not own  
the site on a freehold basis. www.twitter.com/taylorwimpeyplc

nb customer satisfaction and annual injury incidence rate are uk only measures. group revenue for the year increased 
by 7.9% to £3,965.2 million (2016: £3,676.2 million) and we were pleased to 
report an operating profit* of £841.2 million, an increase of 10.1% year on year 
(2016: £764.3 million). we are pleased to note our annual injury incidence rate (aiir) 
for reportable injuries per 100,000 employees and contractors was a record 
low of 152 in 2017 (2016: 211) and our efforts and level of focus on health 
and safety will of course continue. this extends and 
applies to all of our stakeholders. our primary goal is to genuinely 
improve the position of the causes that we support. the other goal is to 
engage our employees in these activities as we recognise it is good for their 
personal development and self-awareness. corporate governance
we are and remain committed to good corporate governance and believe 
that integrity and transparency are key to attaining this. the housing cycle
trading performance and customer demand remained resilient throughout  
the year and in our core geographies. whist we have not seen any adverse impact  
on the new build housing market or consumer confidence, we are monitoring 
both the consumer and political environment. our key market drivers
we operate in a cyclical market, where 
factors such as customer confidence and 
mortgage cost inevitably have a direct 
impact on the short term outlook. uk market outlook
we have been encouraged by early trading 
patterns at the start of the year and despite 
some wider macroeconomic uncertainty, 
customer confidence remains robust and 
market fundamentals are solid.
