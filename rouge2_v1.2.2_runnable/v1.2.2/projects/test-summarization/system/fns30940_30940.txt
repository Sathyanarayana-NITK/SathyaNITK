to translate some of its digital marketing capabilities into

the vision 
to achieve an increasing uk 
market share of lettings and 
estate agency transactions,  
using a proven franchise model 
and multiple, and clearly 
differentiated, property brands. our franchisees are fully insured 
members of professional bodies, supported 
by specialist software, who know their  
local rental market and manage all  
properties locally. we 
cater both for the majority of sellers who 
prefer to instruct an agent operating from 
high street premises and for the growing 
segment of sellers who choose to use an 
agent without a high street office. two of our 
brands have been engaged in estate agency 
for more than 150 years. one change more than any has altered the landscape. how did the journey start? at the core of everything is the need 
to win those first instructions and then keep 
the momentum going which we did with 
regular contact and visits. “we would never have got to where we 
are now if it wasn’t for those around us 
supporting our every step, and guiding 
us in the right direction. it is one of the major residential letting 
agents in the uk with over 37,000 properties under management, 
deriving 87% of its management service fees from lettings 
services. the ewemove franchise model 
combines the recruitment of local property experts (“lpes”), 
typically serving micro territories of 20,000 households through a 
centralised 24/7 technology platform, with the traditional features 
of a full estate agency service and a consumer fee predicated  
on completed sales, rather than listings. unlike those companies where the customer proposition 
is focused on saving commission, ewemove’s promise is 
above all to get the customer’s property sold. however, 
ewemove does share several characteristics with the 
best-known brands; it is nationally recognised, does  
not rely on high street offices, and operates 24/7 for 
customer convenience. the group is 
already taking action to mitigate the effects of the ban 
which is expected to put at risk 16% of our franchisees’ 
lettings revenue, and at a group level 9% of total 
revenue, if annualised*. as well as progressing with ewemove we achieved 
satisfying network revenue growth at all of our traditional 
brands, whitegates leading with 14%, cj hole 9%, 
parkers 6%, martin & co 5% and ellis & co 3%. number of franchises

revenue
group revenue for the financial year to 31 december 
2017 was £10.2m (2016: £8.3m), an increase of £1.9m (23%) 
over the prior year. estate agency
we operate on a no sale no fee basis. tenant fee ban
the government has provided a degree of clarity on its 
intention to ban tenant fees in england & wales. a ban  
in scotland has been in existence since 2012.
the intention appears to be an outright ban, rather than 
a cap, on landlords and their letting agents charging any 
type of pre-tenancy fee. it’s not clear whether certain 
in-tenancy fees will be allowed. financial highlights
* before exceptional items and share-based payment charges. i’m delighted to report that this was matched 
by an almost identical increase in our managed portfolio 
through organic growth. mitigation factors include; 
through organic means and by acquisition, accelerating 
the size of the tenanted managed portfolio, developing 
income from financial services & conveyancing referrals. richard martin
